[2015/11/06 11:42:45] <brmbrmcar> There is no advanced HTML needed.
[2015/11/06 11:43:10] <head8debian> Karkus: its hacked together. i have crontab execute a cp command, then i have it execute a git commit and push command and i have a ssh key set up between github and my server.
[2015/11/06 11:43:23] <head8debian> Karkus: Currently it only gets dumped to 1 file.
[2015/11/06 11:43:32] <head8debian> And my website is thrown together...

[2015/11/06 11:44:55] <head8debian> I could do more...
[2015/11/06 11:46:05] <head8debian> There, now its 5 times a day... that should be better.
[2015/11/06 11:46:12] <head8debian> I really don't want to do more than that.

[2015/11/06 12:15:31] <maths22> I'm working on importing my logs from irssi, and then I will try to make a better front-end

[2015/11/06 12:16:23] <maths22> Karkus: not sure, but the really nice thing about it is that, once I finish making my script, it will be really easy to import logs from irrsi if the logserver goes down

[2015/11/06 17:02:05] <leyyin> btw, I used the travis file from supertux for the stk-editor ;)
[2015/11/06 17:02:12] <leyyin> without proper reference
[2015/11/06 17:02:18] <leyyin> you could say I stole it :P

[2015/11/06 17:05:30] <Karkus> Sorry
[2015/11/06 17:05:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's alright. I am not mean.
[2015/11/06 17:05:36] <Tobbi> I am evil.
[2015/11/06 17:06:00] <leyyin> Tobbi, if you are evil then I am Stalin
[2015/11/06 17:06:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: I think you should stick to torturing babies
[2015/11/06 17:06:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, yeah, we need to devise a new method...
[2015/11/06 17:06:26] <Karkus> Okay that has no context
[2015/11/06 17:06:28] <Tobbi> What about those wind turbines...

[2015/11/06 17:06:35] <Tobbi> We could couple them with cherry cake.

[2015/11/06 17:07:23] <Tobbi> leyyin: We never talked about literally torturing babies.
[2015/11/06 17:07:34] <leyyin> you live in Germany man
[2015/11/06 17:07:40] <Tobbi> And, for the most part, no one of us has ever tortured a baby.
[2015/11/06 17:07:49] <leyyin> they arrest you just for wearing an indian sign ;)
[2015/11/06 17:07:57] <red_bot> Tobbi: sure... your talking about putting 1 baby in 3 trach cans...
[2015/11/06 17:07:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: Speak for yourself :D
[2015/11/06 17:07:58] <Tobbi> leyyin: *cough*
[2015/11/06 17:08:06] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/11/06 17:08:14] <red_bot> Tobbi: According to my perfect logs...
[2015/11/06 17:08:24] <Tobbi> That's the exception. If you believe in Buddhism, it's not actually killing if the baby gets reborn.
[2015/11/06 17:08:38] <Karkus> There are advantages to not having logs too, I guess
[2015/11/06 17:08:42] <Tobbi> Wait, Buddhism, Hinduism, right?
[2015/11/06 17:08:53] <head8debian> Karkus: Haha, true.

[2015/11/06 17:26:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh c'mon...

[2015/11/06 17:33:12] <brmbrmcar> It is the United Kingdom!

[2015/11/06 17:35:08] <brmbrmcar> Why?
[2015/11/06 17:35:43] <Karkus> Why what?
[2015/11/06 17:36:07] <brmbrmcar> Do you not want NI or Wales?
[2015/11/06 17:36:43] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Where do you live?

[2015/11/06 17:37:21] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/06 17:37:26] <Karkus> and Wales, well idk I can't understand them

[2015/11/06 18:01:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: It was speculated a while ago that swimming could be implemented in supertux. Could that be a 0.5.0 thing or is it not possible due the amount of levels that rely on you being unable to swim?
[2015/11/06 18:01:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could certainly put it in the 0.5.0 release list.
[2015/11/06 18:01:39] <Tobbi> eeh, todo list.
[2015/11/06 18:01:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Which is where?
[2015/11/06 18:01:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: not yet created.
[2015/11/06 18:02:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: file a bug report.

[2015/11/06 18:02:15] <Karkus> okay
[2015/11/06 18:02:29] <Tobbi> We'd have to go through the list of levels to see which of these use water...

[2015/11/06 18:04:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe a lot of levels require you to be unable to swim... But maybe we could add a special bonus item.

[2015/11/06 18:13:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: that would be cool. :D What kind of item do you think should give tux the ability to swim?
[2015/11/06 18:13:52] <Tobbi> Because otherwise, we'd have to rework a lot of levels.
[2015/11/06 18:14:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: Flippers would be a kinda funny one
[2015/11/06 18:14:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Penguins are pretty epic at swimming anyway :P
[2015/11/06 18:14:34] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/11/06 18:15:13] <Tobbi> oh, wait. Water has never really been solid.
[2015/11/06 18:15:26] <Tobbi> So, we don't need a special item for tht
[2015/11/06 18:15:27] <Tobbi> that
[2015/11/06 18:15:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: How about this for music: https://soundcloud.com/karkus476/water-theme? Please be honest if it's bad. it's a proof of concept unfinished thing
[2015/11/06 18:16:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: we do, as many levels have water that, if you could swim in it, would make the level easy
[2015/11/06 18:16:29] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2015/11/06 18:16:33] <Tobbi> hah, confusion.
[2015/11/06 18:16:41] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, that theme plays when Tux swims?
[2015/11/06 18:16:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, in underwater levels
[2015/11/06 18:16:59] <Tobbi> Ah...
[2015/11/06 18:17:03] <Tobbi> Hmm, interesting.
[2015/11/06 18:17:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: In my opinion, it needs a more mysterious touch.
[2015/11/06 18:17:37] <Tobbi> Or?
[2015/11/06 18:17:39] <Tobbi> Let me check something.
[2015/11/06 18:17:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah, I see.
[2015/11/06 18:20:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Check what?

[2015/11/06 18:20:30] <Tobbi> Do you know Fish Fillets - Next Generation.
[2015/11/06 18:20:33] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/11/06 18:20:42] <Tobbi> The music doesn't fit well, either.
[2015/11/06 18:21:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't know it
[2015/11/06 18:21:27] <Tobbi> okay.
[2015/11/06 18:21:41] <Karkus> And which music doesn't fit well?
[2015/11/06 18:21:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: The one I linked to, above.
[2015/11/06 18:21:59] <Karkus> Oh, okay
[2015/11/06 18:22:18] <Tobbi> We need something funky, but something that is mysterious at the same time, and "underwater". :P
[2015/11/06 18:22:50] <Tobbi> On the other hand.
[2015/11/06 18:22:56] <Karkus> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xelag0YVrcs
[2015/11/06 18:22:59] <Tobbi> I just checked mario's underwater theme...
[2015/11/06 18:23:05] <Karkus> Ah
[2015/11/06 18:23:43] <Tobbi> Okay, so maybe I was too strict there :D
[2015/11/06 18:24:23] <Karkus> I get what you mean.
[2015/11/06 18:24:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could have music blocks... Things that play a certain note when you hit them :D
[2015/11/06 18:24:55] <Tobbi> And people could play around with that then :D
[2015/11/06 18:25:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: But we need a good editor :P
[2015/11/06 18:25:20] <Tobbi> *sigh* yeah, you're right :D
[2015/11/06 18:25:21] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/11/06 18:25:27] <Tobbi> That prerequisite...
[2015/11/06 18:25:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Add it to the list
[2015/11/06 18:25:42] <Tobbi> Not sure if I should or how much fun that would be :D
[2015/11/06 18:26:48] <Karkus> Tobbi: Once I've done this controls thing I'll see what I can do for the editor.
[2015/11/06 18:26:56] <Tobbi> Alright, thanks
[2015/11/06 18:26:57] <Tobbi> !
[2015/11/06 18:27:14] <Karkus> I wish Grumbel had just commented his code in the first place
[2015/11/06 18:27:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do many OS projects have documentation?
[2015/11/06 18:28:10] <Tobbi> Hmm, that's a thing I don't know. I don't normally follow that many open source projects.
[2015/11/06 18:28:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/06 18:28:26] <Karkus> I doubt it though
[2015/11/06 18:30:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: on the other hand, levels based on music will likely be hard for the hearing impaired.
[2015/11/06 18:30:26] <Tobbi> So maybe we shouldn't develop that idea further...
[2015/11/06 18:31:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: We should have a braile version of the wiki
[2015/11/06 18:31:32] <Karkus> jk :D
[2015/11/06 18:31:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: We could have subtitles
[2015/11/06 18:31:49] <Karkus> If you *really* want
[2015/11/06 18:32:04] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:32:08] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2015/11/06 18:32:23] <Tobbi> How would a music level actually look like anyway?
[2015/11/06 18:32:24] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:33:00] <Tobbi> But, yeah, braille...
[2015/11/06 18:33:01] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:33:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: But, yeah, braille, no :P
[2015/11/06 18:33:47] <datahead8888> A music based level would probably have differet notes or snippets of music play at different points that cue the player in to actions.  For visual look you could have staffs and/or notes.
[2015/11/06 18:34:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: What program did you use to compose the music?
[2015/11/06 18:34:13] <datahead8888> For the hearing impaired you would have to have text that allows them to get the hints without auditory cues.
[2015/11/06 18:34:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: Musescore
[2015/11/06 18:34:24] <Tobbi> Sounds interesting.
[2015/11/06 18:34:49] <datahead8888> Now, programming levels for the blind would be interesting.  You would need auditory cues that allow them to play in a "dark level" so as to speak
[2015/11/06 18:34:53] <Karkus> You can probably already script sounds in anyway
[2015/11/06 18:35:13] <Karkus> Echo location supertux, anyone?
[2015/11/06 18:35:21] <datahead8888> Oh, that's a good idea
[2015/11/06 18:35:32] <datahead8888> It would make an interesting challenge for people who see, too
[2015/11/06 18:35:47] <datahead8888> It would probably have to be a slow moving level
[2015/11/06 18:36:04] <datahead8888> You wouldn't want enemies that move fast and dive bomb the player in something like that :)
[2015/11/06 18:36:16] <Tobbi> Create issues, guys.
[2015/11/06 18:36:17] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:36:19] <Karkus> datahead8888: A pit would be hard enough
[2015/11/06 18:36:29] <Tobbi> Interesting thing for post 0.4.0
[2015/11/06 18:36:45] <Karkus> Everything is interesting when it's post 0.4.0 :D
[2015/11/06 18:36:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:37:19] <datahead8888> I've suggested some of this kind of stuff for Secret Chronicles before - it's all a matter of priorities
[2015/11/06 18:37:24] <datahead8888> But if you want, I could file some issues
[2015/11/06 18:38:27] <datahead8888> While you're at it, it's good to think about disability accessibility for the whole game
[2015/11/06 18:38:32] <datahead8888> What if you have a color blind player?
[2015/11/06 18:38:54] <datahead8888> Or have tones in other parts of the game
[2015/11/06 18:39:22] <Tobbi> But it's hard for colour blind people, anyway.
[2015/11/06 18:39:28] <Tobbi> Unless we filter everything in specific colours/
[2015/11/06 18:39:46] <datahead8888> Well, you'd probably focus on critical items they have to differentiate.
[2015/11/06 18:40:12] <datahead8888> It might be a bit challenging to do unless you can find a color blind volunteer to check out the game
[2015/11/06 18:42:45] <Karkus> datahead8debian: Colour blindness does not affect people that much
[2015/11/06 18:43:09] <Karkus> It's not like black and white, and supertux doesn't need colours to fucntion
[2015/11/06 18:44:00] <datahead8888> If you had text without good contrast it could become an issue
[2015/11/06 18:45:13] <Karkus> datahead8888: I guess. Maybe.
[2015/11/06 18:45:29] <datahead8888> It might not be an issue at all now, though

[2015/11/07 10:21:28] <head8debian> I don't have my nose up to my screen, so why do i need a better screen?
[2015/11/07 10:21:38] <leyyin> higher dpi
[2015/11/07 10:22:31] <Hume2> What do they expect? I don't want to see what's on my computer via a microscope.
[2015/11/07 10:22:45] <head8debian> What i have works fine.
[2015/11/07 10:22:48] <leyyin> you can see the diference man ;)
[2015/11/07 10:22:54] <leyyin> higher quality
[2015/11/07 10:22:58] <leyyin> more sharp
[2015/11/07 10:23:00] <head8debian> Yes i can, ive seen a 4k screen.
[2015/11/07 10:23:05] <leyyin> it's like looking out of a window
[2015/11/07 10:23:09] <head8debian> But my wallet cringes. :D
[2015/11/07 10:23:18] <head8debian> And i only get new when my old breaks.
[2015/11/07 10:23:34] <leyyin> or get new, and keep both :P

[2015/11/07 10:24:11] <head8debian> Hey, im still using a 15in 1024x768px screen. :)
[2015/11/07 10:24:29] <leyyin> that is a weird resolution
[2015/11/07 10:24:36] <Hume2> I'm using 1536×768 screen.
[2015/11/07 10:24:48] <leyyin> are you sure it is not 1366? Hume2
[2015/11/07 10:25:03] <head8debian> My main screen is 1600x900.
[2015/11/07 10:25:22] <Hume2> leyyin: Yes, that's right.
[2015/11/07 10:25:28] <Hume2> leyyin: 1366
[2015/11/07 10:25:35] <Hume2> it is.
[2015/11/07 10:25:42] <head8debian> Only 11954 hours on it. :D
[2015/11/07 10:25:56] <leyyin> how can you tell? head8debian
[2015/11/07 10:26:14] <head8debian> My screen has a menu which tells me...
[2015/11/07 10:26:18] <leyyin> 498 days

[2015/11/07 10:26:42] <leyyin> what?
[2015/11/07 10:26:50] <leyyin> what crappy tractors do you have?
[2015/11/07 10:26:57] <leyyin> I have seen tractors old as 40 years
[2015/11/07 10:26:59] <leyyin> still running
[2015/11/07 10:27:07] <head8debian> Only 40? :)
[2015/11/07 10:27:40] <head8debian> My grandpa has one from when he was 12 thats still running. :) And he is 80.
[2015/11/07 10:27:42] <leyyin> how can a tractor not run for 498 days?
[2015/11/07 10:28:08] <head8debian> Tractors don't go by the amount of miles on them, they go by hours on them.
[2015/11/07 10:28:27] <leyyin> what?
[2015/11/07 10:28:27] <head8debian> 6,000 hours on a Combine is alot.
[2015/11/07 10:28:41] <leyyin> how do they measure that?
[2015/11/07 10:29:02] <head8debian> We have a Skytrak with 12,000 hours and its its startign to show its age.
[2015/11/07 10:29:11] <head8debian> leyyin: Every tractor has a time meter...
[2015/11/07 10:29:19] <head8debian> Well, newer ones...
[2015/11/07 10:29:24] <leyyin> I do not think I saw that kind of thing here tbh
[2015/11/07 10:29:27] <head8debian> after 1980. ;)
[2015/11/07 10:30:02] <head8debian> We run relatively modern equipment because of reliabilty reasons and size.
[2015/11/07 10:30:21] <head8debian> Mdern as within the last 20 years.
[2015/11/07 10:30:46] <head8debian> You cannot cover hundreds of acres with a old "put put". :)
[2015/11/07 10:31:04] <head8debian> Wait, your not in the USA, so you wouldn't understand that reference...
[2015/11/07 10:31:16] <head8debian> leyyin: Whats the most popular tractor over ther?
[2015/11/07 10:31:20] <head8debian> there*
[2015/11/07 10:32:17] <mt> The average european is probably not interested in the popularity of tractors...

[2015/11/07 14:22:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: What kind of sponsor do you mean?
[2015/11/07 14:22:49] <Tobbi> Karkus, a VPS, probably? Something we can do automatic nightly builds on.
[2015/11/07 14:23:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: But someone has to pay for it.
[2015/11/07 14:23:25] <Tobbi> Karkus, Not if the company finds the cause worthwhile.
[2015/11/07 14:23:26] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/07 14:23:30] <Karkus> Unless you mean get an actual sponsor of supertux
[2015/11/07 14:23:39] <Tobbi> I mean: We're an open-source projects, we should be able to get someone to pay for the server.
[2015/11/07 14:23:40] <Tobbi> right?
[2015/11/07 14:24:49] <Tobbi> That's something we could need donations for.
[2015/11/07 14:25:19] <mt> With cross-compiling we could also try to get sponsors for this https://www.scaleway.com/pricing/ (don't forget VAT in EU)
[2015/11/07 14:26:58] <Tobbi> mt, Can you ask around?
[2015/11/07 14:27:12] <mt> Not sure who to ask, tbh
[2015/11/07 14:27:28] <Tobbi> mt, I mean: Ask around whether they'd let us set that up for free? We'd of course link back to them from supertux.github.io
[2015/11/07 14:27:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: You could use my server. :D
[2015/11/07 14:27:33] <Tobbi> Could give them some recognition.
[2015/11/07 14:27:38] <Tobbi> head8debian, For cross-compiling?
[2015/11/07 14:27:41] <Tobbi> head8debian, How good is it?
[2015/11/07 14:27:49] <head8debian> Well, not real good.
[2015/11/07 14:27:55] <head8debian> dual core 2.2ghz IIRC.
[2015/11/07 14:28:11] <Tobbi> head8debian, Problem is uploading stuff with your bandwidth.
[2015/11/07 14:28:15] <Tobbi> I believe.
[2015/11/07 14:28:16] <Tobbi> Right?
[2015/11/07 14:28:30] <mt> You'd not need cross-compilation on x86_64 machines, that server I linked to needs it because it's ARM
[2015/11/07 14:28:38] <head8debian> It would take a few mins.
[2015/11/07 14:29:03] <mt> Also, Online SAS is a rather big company, I'd expect more support from smaller hosting companies
[2015/11/07 14:29:09] <head8debian> But i don't care so much about upload speeds. Down is more annoying.

[2015/11/07 14:30:37] <head8debian> It does have 2gb ram.
[2015/11/07 14:30:47] <mt> Because that server's cheaper; you can cross-compile
[2015/11/07 14:31:28] <head8debian> Im not sure if it has ECC ram or non ECC ram.
[2015/11/07 14:31:28] <mt> You know that cross-compiling is for compiling code on an architecture different from the target architecture.
[2015/11/07 14:31:38] <head8debian> Yes i do...
[2015/11/07 14:32:08] <head8debian> But why do we need to cross compile?
[2015/11/07 14:32:20] <Tobbi> So that people from other OSes can get nightly builds as well?
[2015/11/07 14:32:26] <Tobbi> *using other OSes
[2015/11/07 14:32:38] <head8debian> Well, i could see 32 bit and 64 bit, but say x64-86 to ARM?
[2015/11/07 14:32:49] <mt> Nah, because if we'd build natively for ARM no-one could run the builds
[2015/11/07 14:33:22] <mt> If we cross-compile on ARM for x86_64 and i686, then you could run the binaries on "normal" computers
[2015/11/07 14:33:27] <head8debian> I could handle a couple uploads, but not more than 500mb a night.
[2015/11/07 14:34:11] <mt> Also, head8debian, why do you care about ECC? Even most x86_64 basic-level dedicated servers don't have ECC RAM.
[2015/11/07 14:34:31] <Tobbi> head8debian, The binaries shouldn't exceed 500 MB
[2015/11/07 14:34:37] <Tobbi> Maybe 250 in total or something.
[2015/11/07 14:34:39] <head8debian> Because, i could upgrade the ram if its non ECC. ;)
[2015/11/07 14:34:52] <head8debian> I haven't done any looking into the ram it has atm...
[2015/11/07 14:35:07] <head8debian> I got a mobo-cpu-ram combo and just instaleld it and started using it.
[2015/11/07 14:35:18] <mt> That server I linked to is using an ARM SoC, you can't replace RAM on SoCs.
[2015/11/07 14:35:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: But do we really *need* nightly builds?
[2015/11/07 14:35:32] <head8debian> mt: I do know what a SOC is. :)
[2015/11/07 14:35:45] <Tobbi> head8debian, No, we don't. But weekly builds could be neat.
[2015/11/07 14:36:03] <mt> head8debian: Yet you can't send them your RAM to add it.
[2015/11/07 14:36:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: But what if our development goes dead after M2 is released? :)
[2015/11/07 14:36:24] <head8debian> mt: True...
[2015/11/07 14:36:32] <head8debian> But 2gb ram can do quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:36:38] <head8debian> Not alot, but quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:36:57] <mt> As I said, I can build packaged x86_64 Arch Linux binaries manually once every week.
[2015/11/07 14:36:59] <Tobbi> head8debian, It certainly will.
[2015/11/07 14:37:21] <Tobbi> mt, Can't you cross-compile?
[2015/11/07 14:37:37] <head8debian> mt: I can to. :)
[2015/11/07 14:37:41] <mt> Cross-compile for what
[2015/11/07 14:37:47] <head8debian> mt: Arch packages are easy.
[2015/11/07 14:37:51] <Tobbi> mt, Cross-compile for win32 at least?
[2015/11/07 14:38:08] <Tobbi> Mac might be a problem.
[2015/11/07 14:38:09] <mt> Do we even support building using MinGW?
[2015/11/07 14:38:17] <head8debian> mt: I flagged the Supertux AUR package out of date, but haven't heard back. I even linked them to a updated version of it.
[2015/11/07 14:38:18] <Tobbi> afaik, we do.
[2015/11/07 14:38:55] <head8debian> Well, i would have more ram free if red_bot wasn't taking 250mb. o_O
[2015/11/07 14:38:58] <Tobbi> http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Building_on_Windows says we do with MSYS and MinGW
[2015/11/07 14:39:01] * head8debian stares at red_bot...
[2015/11/07 14:39:11] <Tobbi> red_bot stares back and wonders...
[2015/11/07 14:39:16] <Tobbi> Okay, guys, see you later.
[2015/11/07 14:39:21] <Tobbi> or rather in a minute.

[2015/11/07 14:39:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: The only thing with building is that my CPU fan is noisy. :D
[2015/11/07 14:40:22] <mt> I know that, I have so many computers I could use as homeservers, but they're too noisy

[2015/11/07 14:41:51] <Tobbi_> This project's activity has gone up quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:42:43] <head8debian> mt: my server is the last computer i use currently thats noisy, thankfully. ;)
[2015/11/07 14:43:08] <mt> but: more activity -> more bugs -> more activity -> even more bugs -> /* repeat */ :(
[2015/11/07 14:43:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, i do have another computer that we could use for this... but i don't want to. Then my room would be super really noisy. :p
[2015/11/07 14:43:40] <head8debian> mt: True... but you cannot just live with bugs.
[2015/11/07 14:43:46] <Karkus> mt: But more people to fix bugs

[2015/11/07 14:44:21] <head8debian> Its a loop...
[2015/11/07 14:44:24] <Tobbi> but also resulting in the project being sustainable.
[2015/11/07 14:44:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: How've you got two unaffiliated quotes
[2015/11/07 14:44:26] <mt> and to introduce as well
[2015/11/07 14:44:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: Uh?
[2015/11/07 14:44:46] <Karkus> Tobbi: Tobbi_ is unaffiliated
[2015/11/07 14:44:52] <Karkus> OOps
[2015/11/07 14:44:53] <Tobbi> mt: Doesn't every big open source project have that problem?
[2015/11/07 14:44:54] <Karkus> cloaks
[2015/11/07 14:44:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: yup.
[2015/11/07 14:45:01] <Karkus> not quotes
[2015/11/07 14:45:03] <mt> Karkus: if you're talking about cloaks, they will always be set when you identify
[2015/11/07 14:45:10] <mt> regardless of the nicknames
[2015/11/07 14:45:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: I have no clue how i'd set up my server to build packages like that though... the upload wouldn't be so hard. My server runs debian btw.
[2015/11/07 14:45:38] <Karkus> mt: But you need to get a cloak for each one, and an account for each one
[2015/11/07 14:45:42] <mt> Tobbi: I guess not just every big open source project, every bigger software project
[2015/11/07 14:45:51] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/11/07 14:45:52] <head8debian> Karkus: No, you group the nicks to your account.
[2015/11/07 14:45:57] <mt> Karkus: nope, you can sign in to the same account multiple times
[2015/11/07 14:46:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: Cronjob?
[2015/11/07 14:46:06] <mt> You don't even need to group nicks
[2015/11/07 14:46:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: Of course cronjob, but like to make a .deb file. ive heard they are a PITB.
[2015/11/07 14:46:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: You mean PITA? Yummy.

[2015/11/07 14:47:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: What OSes would i have to build for?
[2015/11/07 14:47:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Linux and maybe Windows. I believe, OS X is too hard to do.
[2015/11/07 14:47:53] <Karkus> head8debian: Solaris only
[2015/11/07 14:47:58] <Karkus> :D
[2015/11/07 14:48:01] <Tobbi> Solaris? urgh
[2015/11/07 14:48:10] <Karkus> I'm just kidding
[2015/11/07 14:48:19] <head8debian> mt: *should* a debian .deb work with ubuntu if its made properly?
[2015/11/07 14:48:23] <head8debian> Karkus: o_O
[2015/11/07 14:48:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: You'd have to transpile supertux into Java and create one JAR
[2015/11/07 14:48:33] <head8debian> I hate java...
[2015/11/07 14:48:37] <Karkus> head8debian: They do
[2015/11/07 14:48:42] <Tobbi> Java hates you as well.
[2015/11/07 14:48:50] <mt> Solaris, killall python :D
[2015/11/07 14:48:56] <head8debian> I use it as little as possible...
[2015/11/07 14:49:10] <Karkus> I used to like the language Java
[2015/11/07 14:49:22] <Karkus> But it's incredibly frustrating
[2015/11/07 14:49:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: careful...my bachelor thesis program is written in Java.
[2015/11/07 14:49:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: How in the world do you make a windows executable? o_O
[2015/11/07 14:49:45] <Karkus> Correction - I love Java it's the best
[2015/11/07 14:49:49] <mt> head8debian: it might work, but even a proper deb package might not work as ubuntu is not binary compatible to debian
[2015/11/07 14:50:02] <head8debian> I don't even know how to compile 32 bit on 64 bit...
[2015/11/07 14:50:05] <Karkus> head8debian: It's a mystery to everyone
[2015/11/07 14:50:13] <head8debian> lol. :-)
[2015/11/07 14:50:49] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:50:54] <mt> same applies to debian releases, e.g. squeeze, wheezy, jessie and sid, as they use different library versions, which will just break (and yes, I'm adding squeeze to the list because it's still supported)
[2015/11/07 14:51:19] <head8debian> mt: Dont forget stretch... ;)
[2015/11/07 14:51:33] <mt> I don't like testing
[2015/11/07 14:51:50] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/07 14:51:51] <leyyin> Tobbi, I write my bachelor thesis in ocaml ;)

[2015/11/07 14:52:29] <leyyin> secret :P
[2015/11/07 14:52:42] @ Quit: darkbasic: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2015/11/07 14:52:52] <leyyin> conversion from some diagrams to a session logic format, so that it easy to generate code
[2015/11/07 14:53:06] <mt> head8debian: Because it doesn't really get security updates - (old(old))stable gets fast security updates as patches; sid/unstable gets fast security updates from the latest release but testing will have to wait for the package to be in sid for some time and therefore won't get fast security updates
[2015/11/07 14:53:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: Sounds complicated.
[2015/11/07 14:53:27] <leyyin> sounds ;)
[2015/11/07 14:53:34] <Tobbi> hmm okay...
[2015/11/07 14:53:40] <leyyin> everything is simple once you know it :D
[2015/11/07 14:53:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: Believe me, writing a rudimentary transpiler was easy... :P
[2015/11/07 14:54:09] <leyyin> :D
[2015/11/07 14:54:10] <Tobbi> Still, it was torn apart by one of the profs.
[2015/11/07 14:54:11] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:54:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do you get to choose your language?
[2015/11/07 14:54:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: My prof wanted me to use...uh...yacc for that...
[2015/11/07 14:55:00] <leyyin> haha, yacc
[2015/11/07 14:55:02] <Tobbi> Karkus: But he told me something about "Compiler compiler" and I was freaked out.
[2015/11/07 14:55:09] <leyyin> or lex :P
[2015/11/07 14:55:17] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I was like: No way on earth am I gonna use a compiler compiler. I'm gonna write my own thing.
[2015/11/07 14:55:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: O_o
[2015/11/07 14:55:31] <Tobbi> It would've been easier using yacc, I believe.
[2015/11/07 14:55:46] <Tobbi> But, who cares :D
[2015/11/07 14:56:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: What did you use in the end though?
[2015/11/07 14:56:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: I wrote a transpiler in Java.
[2015/11/07 14:56:32] <Karkus> Oh, yeah
[2015/11/07 14:56:34] <Tobbi> That uses a stack and a map.

[2015/11/07 14:56:58] <leyyin> you should have used that ^
[2015/11/07 14:57:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: Uses too much memory.
[2015/11/07 14:57:11] <Tobbi> Also, it's too hairy.
[2015/11/07 14:57:12] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:57:17] <leyyin> I have my last homework for my compilers course to use lex or yacc
[2015/11/07 14:57:22] <Tobbi> I am not a yacc-ophile.

[2015/11/07 14:57:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 15:00:21] <mt> why don't you use bison if you don't like yacc?

[2015/11/07 19:14:05] <Karkus> Who is darkbasic and why do they always quit and join?
[2015/11/07 19:22:34] <head8debian> Karkus: Ask him...
[2015/11/07 19:22:36] <head8debian> ;)
[2015/11/07 19:23:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: one of them quits, the other joins, it's so easy.
[2015/11/07 19:23:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: But why
[2015/11/07 19:23:51] <Karkus> hehe
[2015/11/07 19:24:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: You know those moments when you don't know whether you want to enter a room or leave it and are stuck in the doorframe? This is no different.
[2015/11/07 19:25:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: Silently jumping back and forth through the doorframe...
[2015/11/07 19:25:40] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/11/07 19:26:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's the problem on the big channels like #freenode, so many join/part messages you have no option but to silence them

[2015/11/07 22:15:49] <datahead8888> Tobbi, did you want tickets for the music level or dark level with sound cues ideas?
[2015/11/07 22:16:08] <Tobbi> datahead8888: Yes, please. Whether we implement those is a different thing.
[2015/11/07 22:16:14] <Tobbi> Currently, I am busy with college..
[2015/11/07 22:16:16] <Tobbi> And it's 4am
[2015/11/07 22:16:43] <datahead8888> Okay, I thought you had suggested tickets earlier
[2015/11/07 22:17:10] <datahead8888> I just know that these may stay open for a while, and you guys usually seem to try to get tickets closed quickly, though maybe ‎I overperceived that
[2015/11/07 22:18:20] <Tobbi> No, it's exactly what we try to do.
[2015/11/07 22:18:32] <head8debian> Hey Tobbi.

[2015/11/08 12:18:51] <mt> please noo
[2015/11/08 12:19:07] <mt> try to make vector images
[2015/11/08 12:19:47] <mt> OS X, for example, uses 1024x1024 for HiDPI when 512x512 would be used
[2015/11/08 12:20:04] <brmbrmcar> But vector is bad...
[2015/11/08 12:20:57] <mt> Why is vector bad?
[2015/11/08 12:21:49] <brmbrmcar> Because it will only really be good within a certain size range.
[2015/11/08 12:21:52] <mt> It's smaller and can be scaled up without limit
[2015/11/08 12:22:05] <head8debian> mt: I do love vectors, but i would need to redo tux from scratch, which i wasnt planning on doing. the bitmap trace tool is still not very good.
[2015/11/08 12:22:25] <head8debian> Cannot .png do something similar?
[2015/11/08 12:22:37] <brmbrmcar> It is useful in enlarging, but should be modified heavily.
[2015/11/08 12:23:07] <mt> brmbrmcar: that's because vector graphics show exactly what you told them. If you don't include details it may look ugly when big.
[2015/11/08 12:23:40] <brmbrmcar> I k-now.
[2015/11/08 12:24:02] <brmbrmcar> I think we should just use the on in the repository.
[2015/11/08 12:24:14] <brmbrmcar> It's way better than any others.

[2015/11/08 12:28:30] <mt> head8debian: you can also try writing the svg in a text editor

[2015/11/08 13:42:42] <brmbrmcar> Use that.
[2015/11/08 13:42:50] <brmbrmcar> Trial it now.
[2015/11/08 13:43:04] <brmbrmcar> I can test it after.
[2015/11/08 14:13:27] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ping!!!!! PING@!
[2015/11/08 14:13:32] <Tobbi> calm down.
[2015/11/08 14:13:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: what?
[2015/11/08 14:13:55] <head8debian> PedroCosta: Feel free to ask Tobbi What you need answers to. :)
[2015/11/08 14:14:05] <brmbrmcar> CTCP PING reply from Tobbi: 0.531 seconds
[2015/11/08 14:14:12] <Tobbi> Stop it.
[2015/11/08 14:14:33] <brmbrmcar> Only did it once!
[2015/11/08 14:15:37] <PedroCosta> Will do!
[2015/11/08 14:15:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: He is talking to me in PM...
[2015/11/08 14:16:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: And he is going to try to talk to you now...
[2015/11/08 14:16:14] <Tobbi> gosh
[2015/11/08 14:17:00] <brmbrmcar> We all know how scary Tobbi is!
[2015/11/08 14:18:35] <PedroCosta> Trying to do a SuperTux deployment diagram, and wanted to know the kind of connection the PC establishes to get those. And what it connects to (is it a webserver) ?
[2015/11/08 14:18:42] <PedroCosta> the addons and maps
[2015/11/08 14:18:56] <Tobbi> PedroCosta: It's a github repository that gets queried.
[2015/11/08 14:19:08] <PedroCosta> Ah, I see!

[2015/11/09 11:51:22] <Karkus> I managed (by accident) to get a profile with a map messed up like this. But your commit doesn't fix it, it just stops it from occurring
[2015/11/09 11:51:26] <Karkus> Which is better

[2015/11/09 11:53:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, testing all paths leading to the current position might be the correct way, though that would be much more difficult.

[2015/11/09 12:03:22] <mt> I already described that in the issues tho
[2015/11/09 12:04:11] <mt> That library-version issue is also what can happen when you upgrade systems partially

[2015/11/09 12:18:52] <mt> what can be done to fix the version-related issue is versioning the library in the filename
[2015/11/09 12:18:55] <mt> like:
[2015/11/09 12:18:58] <mt> lrwxrwxrwx 1    24 Nov  2 23:28 /usr/lib/libavformat.so -> libavformat.so.56.40.101*
[2015/11/09 12:18:59] <Karkus> mt: But isn't there a better place that is more universal among the linux distros
[2015/11/09 12:19:00] <mt> lrwxrwxrwx 1    24 Nov  2 23:28 /usr/lib/libavformat.so.56 -> libavformat.so.56.40.101*

[2015/11/09 12:19:47] <mt> the right place would be /lib, but if the user says "install to prefix /a/b/c" then we shouldn't install something somewhere else

[2015/11/09 12:27:24] <Karkus> I'm thinking SuperTree
[2015/11/09 12:27:27] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/09 12:27:58] <Tobbi> SuperVelociraptor.

[2015/11/09 12:30:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: The changes I'm making in https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/184 are quickly becoming quite incompatible with the previous version. It's backwards compatible, but not foreward compatible
[2015/11/09 12:30:27] <Karkus> by which I mean it could screw people's configs

[2015/11/09 12:30:39] <Karkus> If they try to use an older version
[2015/11/09 12:30:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: You could always copy the file over if it exists in the old location?
[2015/11/09 12:30:51] <Tobbi> Or rather move it, don't kno.

[2015/11/09 12:31:20] <Tobbi> Okay, good!
[2015/11/09 12:31:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: but if someone decides they prefer 0.3.6 and go back, they'll lose their settings.
[2015/11/09 12:32:12] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2015/11/09 12:32:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, copying is not the same as moving, right?
[2015/11/09 12:32:34] <Tobbi> So, if you keep the old file...?
[2015/11/09 12:33:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Good idea. I'll use a 'profile' file to store the current profile.
[2015/11/09 12:33:45] <Tobbi> :-) alright
[2015/11/09 12:33:57] <Karkus> Then old 'config' can stick around
[2015/11/09 12:34:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: We just need to make sure that people don't mistakenly try to alter their old config.
[2015/11/09 12:36:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'll get it to add a comment warning that this is a 0.3.6 config file and is ignored by 0.4.0
[2015/11/09 12:36:37] <Tobbi> Sure! That sounds good. Hopefully it's not too complicated.

[2015/11/09 14:05:14] <Tobbi_> Karkus, It's alright... :P
[2015/11/09 14:05:27] <Tobbi_> Karkus, You know, sometimes I overload people with work, for the sake of doing it.

[2015/11/09 14:05:51] <Tobbi_> Karkus, I do. Because I am rather worried about people getting overworked.
[2015/11/09 14:06:04] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I'm not overworked
[2015/11/09 14:06:17] <Karkus> We have a deadline, and it needs meeting
[2015/11/09 14:06:22] <Tobbi_> Karkus, I know, but it can get that way too fast when you're getting overinvolved. :-)
[2015/11/09 14:06:34] <Tobbi_> I know that from my Mozilla contributor days.
[2015/11/09 14:06:43] <Karkus> I can add it to my new todo list http://swapoff.org/devtodo.html
[2015/11/09 14:06:46] <Tobbi_> But it's good that you'll take a break when you feel like it ;)

[2015/11/10 12:18:37] <Hume2> Hello, head8debian!
[2015/11/10 12:19:07] <Hume2> Someone should exterminate Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 12:19:48] <head8debian> Hume2: Nah, just windows.
[2015/11/10 12:20:08] <head8debian> Microsoft hasdone some cool things.
[2015/11/10 12:21:09] <Hume2> Just wait 70 years until the copyright laws will run out.
[2015/11/10 12:21:48] <Hume2> I read what Windows 10 everything does. I just feel a big rage.
[2015/11/10 12:21:48] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:21:53] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/10 12:22:03] <head8debian> Karkus: o_O
[2015/11/10 12:22:18] <Karkus> head8debian: What?
[2015/11/10 12:22:42] @ Quit: alket: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2015/11/10 12:23:00] <Hume2> When Windows10 spies all the computers, it should work vice-versa too.
[2015/11/10 12:23:34] <Karkus> head8debian:idk how we do the windows builds.
[2015/11/10 12:24:51] <head8debian> Karkus: Good question.
[2015/11/10 12:24:53] <head8debian> Hume2: :D
[2015/11/10 12:25:03] <Hume2> Karkus: Please don't. Windows is a spyware.
[2015/11/10 12:25:28] <head8debian> Windows is a pile of crud, but people use it, so we have to also.
[2015/11/10 12:25:41] <Hume2> No, we don't have to.
[2015/11/10 12:26:10] <Hume2> Yes, people are monkeys, even I am a monkey. Monkeys must do the same as the others.
[2015/11/10 12:26:40] <head8debian> We can support it, but it doesn't mean we have to use it ourselves. :)
[2015/11/10 12:27:00] <Hume2> Yes.
[2015/11/10 12:27:19] <Hume2> It needs to hack the camera to send some random faces.
[2015/11/10 12:27:29] <head8debian> I do use it, and what little i don't like...
[2015/11/10 12:27:34] <Hume2> Don't you know how to make a random face generator?
[2015/11/10 12:27:55] <head8debian> Ehm, no?
[2015/11/10 12:28:26] <Hume2> I think, messing up Microsoft's server with junk data could work.
[2015/11/10 12:28:34] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/10 12:28:57] <head8debian> How are you going to mess up their servers when they use linux? :p
[2015/11/10 12:29:07] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 12:29:36] <Hume2> Well, let's start milions virtual machines with windows 10.
[2015/11/10 12:29:54] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 264 seconds
[2015/11/10 12:30:04] <Hume2> Well, that's not a good idea.
[2015/11/10 12:30:14] <head8debian> It would take more like billions...
[2015/11/10 12:31:01] <Hume2> Do you think that they have any backups of that spy-data?
[2015/11/10 12:32:35] <Hume2> I read that a new type of viruses have been invited. They install your OS as a virtual machine, so you can't get that they are even on your computer. Any way.
[2015/11/10 12:34:37] <Hume2> They could then send fake data to the camera and keyboard.
[2015/11/10 12:35:31] <Hume2> ...but no idea how to make those viruses...
[2015/11/10 12:36:38] <brmbrmcar> Awesome hacks!
[2015/11/10 12:40:05] <brmbrmcar> On a Microsoft e-mail account, I think that you can change your name to a script, possibly accessing more scripts that could destroy the servers.
[2015/11/10 12:40:54] <Hume2> I guess that special characters are blocked, so that wouldn't work. However, it could be good if that worked.
[2015/11/10 12:43:17] <brmbrmcar> It allows all xharacters.
[2015/11/10 12:45:58] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I think that it just displays those characters, but they are saved another way.
[2015/11/10 12:47:10] <Hume2> Anyway, it would have to run that script somehow. And I don't think that their software is equiped to run the scripts from usernames.
[2015/11/10 12:48:31] @ bb010g joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:48:59] <head8debian> Just drop a bomb on one of their server rooms...
[2015/11/10 12:49:45] <Hume2> That works too, but it's quite too simple.
[2015/11/10 12:51:11] <Hume2> Anyway, when it sends the users' photos, it can measure the dimensions of their skull.
[2015/11/10 12:51:40] <brmbrmcar> I know it works to run scripts to make you an admin.
[2015/11/10 12:51:55] <Hume2> So they know, what race you are and where you live. Doesn't it resemble you anything?
[2015/11/10 12:52:39] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes, but some kind of boss must make you an admin. And there are tons of passwords.
[2015/11/10 12:53:48] <brmbrmcar> I mean, the develpors surely use some sort of GUI.
[2015/11/10 12:54:28] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:54:41] <Hume2> Yes, that's it. You'd have to force a developer to make you an admin.
[2015/11/10 12:55:02] <brmbrmcar> I'll try and find a video of the hack.
[2015/11/10 12:56:32] <brmbrmcar> I cannot find it. Probably taken down.
[2015/11/10 13:00:00] <Hume2> Do you think that they could misuse the data to make a genocide?
[2015/11/10 13:01:03] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/10 13:01:09] <brmbrmcar> But they wouldn't.
[2015/11/10 13:01:48] <Hume2> Could we be sure?
[2015/11/10 13:03:45] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/10 13:03:59] <brmbrmcar> We need to destroy Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 13:04:11] <brmbrmcar> Before they destroy one of us.
[2015/11/10 13:04:39] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2015/11/10 13:05:08] <Hume2> It needs something easy and effective.
[2015/11/10 13:08:24] @ Wuzzy joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 13:09:06] <Hume2> What about funny wideos with anti-Windows theme? Can it ever become popular?
[2015/11/10 13:12:12] <Hume2> What about a new SuperTux sign with crossed Windows logo?
[2015/11/10 13:12:34] <brmbrmcar> Supertux logo!
[2015/11/10 13:12:47] <brmbrmcar> No Apple builds either.
[2015/11/10 13:13:01] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: We need Tobbi though
[2015/11/10 13:14:50] <Hume2> I like those anti-Windowsish memes, they are so funny!
[2015/11/10 13:15:49] <Hume2> Automatic updates on Windows 8: Changing shape, don't turn off the computer.
[2015/11/10 13:16:17] <Hume2> Widows 8 causes the global warming.
[2015/11/10 13:16:38] <brmbrmcar> It certainally contributes to it.
[2015/11/10 13:17:54] <Hume2> Windows 8 needs a bazilion of ventilators to don't melt.
[2015/11/10 13:18:49] <brmbrmcar> Windows 8 overheats computers.
[2015/11/10 13:18:52] <Hume2> One pin of procesor has melted down. If not, correct it.
[2015/11/10 13:19:36] <Hume2> Your RAM is not supprted. Try DDR6 or newer.
[2015/11/10 13:24:10] <brmbrmcar> Please make this freezer colder.
[2015/11/10 13:25:44] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:28:30] <brmbrmcar> My laptop is fanless and has never overheated.
[2015/11/10 13:28:53] <brmbrmcar> Windows computers overheat in Antarctica.
[2015/11/10 13:28:58] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:29:31] <Hume2> Is it allowed to stick anti-Windowsish memes on the streats?
[2015/11/10 13:30:49] <brmbrmcar> Maybe.

[2015/11/10 13:31:55] <Hume2> It can't be a comparing ad, so there can't be any advertisement to any other system.
[2015/11/10 13:32:58] <brmbrmcar> How about advertise Windows, but make it bad?
[2015/11/10 13:33:42] <Hume2> Yes, like an ad, that will freak out more likely.
[2015/11/10 13:34:01] <brmbrmcar> Like Windows 10. Want to be hacked?
[2015/11/10 13:34:11] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:34:50] <Hume2> Or something that will not metion that it's about Windows, but still freaking out of it.
[2015/11/10 13:35:13] <Hume2> For example, there will be "Blindous 10" instead of "Windows 10".
[2015/11/10 13:35:32] <brmbrmcar> HP Stream. The 200 euro brick.
[2015/11/10 13:35:42] <Hume2> What's that?
[2015/11/10 13:36:25] <brmbrmcar> It is a cheap Chromebook competitor that runs Windows.

[2015/11/10 14:10:40] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Do you know personally anyone who tells that Windows 10 is good?
[2015/11/10 14:11:44] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Only kids like Windows 10.
[2015/11/10 14:11:55] <brmbrmcar> And Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 14:12:21] <Hume2> Just find someone who will stick those things across the streats.
[2015/11/10 14:13:04] <brmbrmcar> Easy.
[2015/11/10 14:13:28] <Hume2> Narre could do that :D
[2015/11/10 14:13:55] <Hume2> Don't ever tell him that I mentioned him, he doesn't like it.
[2015/11/10 14:14:17] <Hume2> Sometimes at night...
[2015/11/10 14:14:32] <Hume2> And watch out the hidden cameras.
[2015/11/10 14:16:37] <brmbrmcar> If he did it carefully, he could probably do it in a blindspot.
[2015/11/10 14:17:20] <Hume2> If I was sure that noone could see me, I'd do it.
[2015/11/10 14:19:26] <Hume2> I could stick some to the bus stops those are already sticked by many stuff.
[2015/11/10 14:20:05] <brmbrmcar> I was thinking of bus stops.
[2015/11/10 14:21:53] <Hume2> Do you think that it could have any effect?
[2015/11/10 14:22:02] <brmbrmcar> Possibly.
[2015/11/10 14:22:11] <Hume2> Same for me.
[2015/11/10 14:22:59] <brmbrmcar> Maybe if it was very high quality, people wouldn't take it as much of a joke.
[2015/11/10 14:23:19] <brmbrmcar> And at the bottom write on legal stuff.
[2015/11/10 14:24:26] <Hume2> Yes. I think that there should be also someting that is called "Blindous 10". I could be really whatever, even an application that throws an error and closes.
[2015/11/10 14:24:46] <Hume2> And it must be for free.
[2015/11/10 14:25:18] <brmbrmcar> Open source.
[2015/11/10 14:25:35] <Hume2> Why not?
[2015/11/10 14:26:52] <brmbrmcar> Indeed.
[2015/11/10 14:28:57] <Hume2> Well, is there something that it could contain in addition?
[2015/11/10 14:30:54] <Hume2> I think that the people should notice it, so I wouldn't add much detail.
[2015/11/10 14:32:26] <Hume2> Is there a possibility that it would be in TV?
[2015/11/10 14:32:41] <brmbrmcar> How much does it cost?
[2015/11/10 14:34:09] <Hume2> Well, it costs one piece of paper and some glue. Not much.

[2015/11/10 23:41:01] <maths22> I have travis/appveyor based builds running off of my own forks here: http://brlcad.org/~maths22/supertux-nightly/
[2015/11/10 23:41:43] <maths22> The OSX one needs work so all the dependencies get included, but I think the others work
[2015/11/10 23:43:34] <maths22> If these builds seem good, I can re-work the scripts to integrate better in the offical repos

[2015/11/11 11:42:30] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: So why the level andrews_island_level6.stl has a castle background?
[2015/11/11 11:42:40] <brmbrmcar> Will fix.
[2015/11/11 11:42:57] <brmbrmcar> I also noticed a couple of things I forgot.
[2015/11/11 11:43:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: ;( My neighbor down the road has 10mb/s internet. And im stuck on 3 with a unreliable ISP. :( :p
[2015/11/11 11:43:01] <maths22> Also, I have discovered my RPM build does nto work
[2015/11/11 11:43:08] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:43:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Ask them to upgrade you.
[2015/11/11 11:43:25] <maths22> Tobbi: what version of OSX are you on?
[2015/11/11 11:43:47] <Tobbi> maths22: 10.11.1
[2015/11/11 11:44:13] <maths22> OK.  That actually may be why it doesn't work
[2015/11/11 11:44:27] <maths22> I'll see if I can test/debug on a machine with El Capitan
[2015/11/11 11:45:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, they wouldn't because the person with the tower chose their most expensive plan. :D
[2015/11/11 11:45:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh? :D
[2015/11/11 11:45:44] <Tobbi> I see.
[2015/11/11 11:45:56] <head8debian> $120/month...
[2015/11/11 11:46:49] <head8debian> I have better upload speeds then them yet though. :D
[2015/11/11 11:47:37] <maths22> Tobbi: What kind of error do you get?
[2015/11/11 11:49:02] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: the level 5 was unlaunchable, so I corrected it.
[2015/11/11 11:49:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: And i suposably have a bandwidth cap which ive never seen implemented when ive gone 5 times over it...
[2015/11/11 11:49:20] <Tobbi> maths22: you can't open the application because it may be damaged or incomplete
[2015/11/11 11:49:28] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:49:40] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You can edit the infoblock's message by editor. It's called "edit script", but it's the message in fact.
[2015/11/11 11:49:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: roughtly 100gb. :p
[2015/11/11 11:49:53] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:50:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't have a bandwidth cap, fortunately.
[2015/11/11 11:50:06] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: I k-now.
[2015/11/11 11:50:08] <head8debian> :)
[2015/11/11 11:50:16] <maths22> Tobbi: see http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/58086
[2015/11/11 11:50:19] <brmbrmcar> How do you change the font though?
[2015/11/11 11:50:33] <maths22> Do you have that set to Anywhere, or something else?
[2015/11/11 11:50:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: Your a city slicker... i live in the middle of knowwhere, 10 miles from decent internet. Ok, more like 3. :p
[2015/11/11 11:50:42] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You put the formating char to the begining.
[2015/11/11 11:50:52] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: # stands for normal text.
[2015/11/11 11:50:58] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/11 11:51:07] <brmbrmcar> Didn't know that.
[2015/11/11 11:51:15] * head8debian should just start running fiber from house to house out here... then set up a cache server...
[2015/11/11 11:51:20] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: - stands for big text, space is small text and tab is blue text.
[2015/11/11 11:51:51] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: ! stands for image and any other char is black text.
[2015/11/11 11:53:22] <Tobbi> maths22: Hmm, supertux opens just fine when I double-click on the contained executable.
[2015/11/11 11:53:37] <maths22> That is what I expected
[2015/11/11 11:53:48] <maths22> It is a silly OS X security issue type of thing
[2015/11/11 11:53:57] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: For the level 5, it's nice. Just take a look at note 5 or 4. You can just add some poles so the wood won't levitate.
[2015/11/11 11:54:08] <Tobbi> maths22: No, the issue is still there, even if I disable that thingy from above.
[2015/11/11 11:54:22] <maths22> Tobbi: I figured
[2015/11/11 11:55:18] <maths22> I'll try to fix that this afternoon
[2015/11/11 11:56:00] <maths22> I also need to change linux so it includes the libraries in the package
[2015/11/11 11:56:39] <Tobbi> maths22: So, do you know what's wrong then?
[2015/11/11 11:57:20] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: level6, We have a cave background, even a cave music, so you can use it.
[2015/11/11 11:57:32] <maths22> Not sure, but since it is not an El Capitan specifc issue, I should be able to debug it
[2015/11/11 11:57:56] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/11 11:59:04] <maths22> Can you try editing the Info.plist so that CFBundleExecutable is SuperTux and not supertux2?
[2015/11/11 12:00:00] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: For level6, take a look at notes 4, 5, 6, 14 and 31.
[2015/11/11 12:00:43] <Tobbi> maths22: 11.11.15 17:58:06,159 lsd[367]: LaunchServices: Could not store lsd-identifiers file at /private/var/db/lsd/com.apple.lsdschemes.plist
[2015/11/11 12:00:48] <Tobbi> That's what I get.
[2015/11/11 12:00:53] <Tobbi> Not sure if it helps you in any way.
[2015/11/11 12:02:33] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: OK.
[2015/11/11 12:03:29] <maths22> Tobbi: thanks.  I'll take a look later on my school's machines
[2015/11/11 12:03:34] <Tobbi> Sure.

[2015/11/11 12:28:39] <maths22> Ideally, more of our version numbers would be in the same place (so we don't have to go tracking each of them down to update the version)

[2015/11/11 12:45:43] <Tobbi> Apparently I didn't exceed the character count.
[2015/11/11 12:45:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: what_
[2015/11/11 12:45:46] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/11/11 12:46:31] <head8debian> Im tryign to set up squid with 2 ethernet cards and nano... :p
[2015/11/11 12:46:33] <mt> no https (or at least hashes) for the nightly builds?
[2015/11/11 12:46:56] <Tobbi> ask maths22
[2015/11/11 12:47:18] <mt> next week you'll have no execuse for not supporting TLS (https://letsencrypt.org/) :P
[2015/11/11 12:47:55] <Tobbi> great!
[2015/11/11 12:51:35] <brmbrmcar> maths22: How do I install the linux tar.gz file?
[2015/11/11 12:53:50] <Tobbi> maths22, head8debian, Karkus, mt: What do you guys think? http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=6630
[2015/11/11 12:55:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: Great!
[2015/11/11 12:55:59] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 12:56:04] <Tobbi> So there's that.
[2015/11/11 12:56:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: The only thing on that list which has remained unaffected by this project is my cat
[2015/11/11 12:56:50] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 12:58:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: If I had a cat, I believe, I'd try Schroedinger's experiment with it.
[2015/11/11 12:58:47] <Tobbi> So, it's good that I don't have one.
[2015/11/11 12:58:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah
[2015/11/11 12:59:13] <Karkus> Probably
[2015/11/11 12:59:48] <Karkus> Not a very interesting experiment really though is it Tobbi?
[2015/11/11 13:00:09] <Karkus> Outcomes 1) Cat ded 2) Cat live
[2015/11/11 13:00:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: Not as interesting as the Babies-in-the-dishwasher experiment. Exactly!
[2015/11/11 13:00:42] <Tobbi> While the babies-in-the-dishwasher experiment has a multitude of different outcomes, fractures, amount of blood etc.
[2015/11/11 13:01:03] <Karkus> And all of them are super exciting!
[2015/11/11 13:01:26] <Tobbi> For sure!
[2015/11/11 13:01:37] <brmbrmcar> Poor babies.
[2015/11/11 13:03:34] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: No, wrong. Poor dishwasher, rather.
[2015/11/11 13:03:36] <Karkus> Well, older rich people don't submit themse as willing volunteers
[2015/11/11 13:03:43] <Karkus> themselves*
[2015/11/11 13:06:29] <brmbrmcar> How about my method of harming babies?
[2015/11/11 13:06:36] <brmbrmcar> No restraint.
[2015/11/11 13:06:39] <brmbrmcar> Crash!
[2015/11/11 13:08:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: You, know what's best about nightly builds?
[2015/11/11 13:09:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: what?

[2015/11/11 13:09:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: good? I think that's a bad thing :D
[2015/11/11 13:09:44] <Tobbi> Meaning more bugs for all of us.
[2015/11/11 13:09:50] <Tobbi> But wait, we had that topic, already.
[2015/11/11 13:10:16] <brmbrmcar> Bugs are good.

[2015/11/11 13:15:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Shall I close it?
[2015/11/11 13:15:17] <mt> maths22: please - try to link the linux binaries statically, else it will break on distros that don't use the same library versions as the build system's distro
[2015/11/11 13:15:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: You could. I wonder how often maths22 is willing to build these, but, yeah, go ahead.
[2015/11/11 13:16:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: Manually built?
[2015/11/11 13:16:10] <mt> maths22: like "games/supertux2: error while loading shared libraries: libGLEW.so.1.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory", I'm already using glew-1.13.0
[2015/11/11 13:16:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, I mean "trigger a build", afaik he still has to do it.
[2015/11/11 13:16:41] <brmbrmcar> ./supertux2: error while loading shared libraries: libtinygettext.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[2015/11/11 13:17:00] <mt> brmbrmcar: yeah that's because it's not statically linked
[2015/11/11 13:17:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, it can't be considered a nightly release then...
[2015/11/11 13:17:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: hmm, right....but maybe he is willing to build them every day.
[2015/11/11 13:17:35] <mt> Karkus: well, you can write a cronjob triggering it every night
[2015/11/11 13:17:55] <Tobbi> I could've labeled them developer releases, but that would be confusing.
[2015/11/11 13:18:00] <brmbrmcar> mt:So what do I have to do?
[2015/11/11 13:18:25] <mt> brmbrmcar: wait until the builds are statically linked
[2015/11/11 13:18:54] <brmbrmcar> What can I do in the meantime? Do i have to build tinygettext?
[2015/11/11 13:19:02] <Karkus> mt: But does he want to? (or rather will he?)
[2015/11/11 13:19:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah, not that
[2015/11/11 13:19:50] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Why do you depend on developer releases. You know how to build supertux, don't you?
[2015/11/11 13:20:20] <brmbrmcar> Not really.
[2015/11/11 13:20:37] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You never built supertux yourself?
[2015/11/11 13:20:39] <brmbrmcar> I don't know how to build sdl 2.03.
[2015/11/11 13:20:48] <brmbrmcar> I used the ppa.
[2015/11/11 13:20:48] <Tobbi> Do you need to build it?
[2015/11/11 13:20:54] <Tobbi> So, where's the problem?
[2015/11/11 13:20:55] <brmbrmcar> On Ubuntu.
[2015/11/11 13:21:07] <brmbrmcar> All sorts of bugs.
[2015/11/11 13:21:20] <brmbrmcar> And this was on my previous Ubuntu install.
[2015/11/11 13:21:22] <mt> Building on Ubuntu works just fine
[2015/11/11 13:21:35] <mt> Travis builds are running on ubuntu
[2015/11/11 13:21:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe we should assemble a WIP release notes document.
[2015/11/11 13:21:53] <Tobbi> And make it organization-visible only for now.
[2015/11/11 13:22:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: On Google docs for example?
[2015/11/11 13:22:21] <Karkus> Or what and how?
[2015/11/11 13:22:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: I wonder if Github allows you to do secret wiki pages?
[2015/11/11 13:22:28] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/11 13:22:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Secret gist?
[2015/11/11 13:22:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: I like this idea very much.
[2015/11/11 13:22:54] <Tobbi> That might work!
[2015/11/11 13:23:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: It doesn't have to be secret...
[2015/11/11 13:23:24] <Tobbi> Sure, I just don't want people to assume this is an actual release right now.
[2015/11/11 13:23:30] <Tobbi> So, yeah, indeed, there's nothing secret about it.
[2015/11/11 13:24:22] <brmbrmcar> So I can't see it!
[2015/11/11 13:25:06] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What?
[2015/11/11 13:25:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Are you drafting the gist or shall I?
[2015/11/11 13:25:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: How do I create a gist as SuperTux?
[2015/11/11 13:25:32] <Tobbi> Ah, one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:25:34] <brmbrmcar> I won't be able to see it!
[2015/11/11 13:25:44] <brmbrmcar> It is a secret.
[2015/11/11 13:25:58] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: We'll see.
[2015/11/11 13:26:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: Having a secret gist would be a little complex
[2015/11/11 13:26:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, anyone with the url could see it
[2015/11/11 13:26:38] <Karkus> but the URL wouldn't have to be publiv
[2015/11/11 13:26:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: There doesn't seem to be any way to create a gist as an organization.
[2015/11/11 13:27:13] <Tobbi> https://gist.github.com/tobbi/c9fd5380aed73ce4bb82
[2015/11/11 13:27:18] <Tobbi> Wonder if you can access it and edit it.
[2015/11/11 13:28:22] <brmbrmcar> I can see it.
[2015/11/11 13:28:28] <Tobbi> Yes, but editing...
[2015/11/11 13:28:41] <Tobbi> actually, one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:28:46] <mt> I wonder if forking as organization would work
[2015/11/11 13:28:49] <brmbrmcar> Not editing.
[2015/11/11 13:28:58] <Karkus> Nope.
[2015/11/11 13:30:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: Damn.
[2015/11/11 13:30:31] <Tobbi> one moment, I'll find a way...
[2015/11/11 13:30:32] <brmbrmcar> I forked it.
[2015/11/11 13:30:33] <Tobbi> an etherpad, or something.
[2015/11/11 13:30:39] <brmbrmcar> And could edit.
[2015/11/11 13:30:48] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Won't help.
[2015/11/11 13:31:21] <brmbrmcar> I k-now.

[2015/11/11 13:33:41] <leyyin> Tobbi, your document is getting vandalized
[2015/11/11 13:33:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: By you?
[2015/11/11 13:34:03] <leyyin> I only added "Woohooo"
[2015/11/11 13:34:07] <Tobbi> gargh
[2015/11/11 13:34:11] <Tobbi> Let's try the wiki.
[2015/11/11 13:34:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: I added git shortlog v0.3.5..HEAD
[2015/11/11 13:34:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: I just wondered if it worked
[2015/11/11 13:34:35] <Tobbi> Aka, all commits since v0.3.5a
[2015/11/11 13:34:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, all the git commits
[2015/11/11 13:34:41] <Tobbi> oh!
[2015/11/11 13:34:41] <Karkus> Okay
[2015/11/11 13:34:43] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:34:47] <Tobbi> Wrong version.
[2015/11/11 13:35:04] <mt> can '^Merge pull request #.*' be excluded
[2015/11/11 13:35:20] <brmbrmcar> I think so.
[2015/11/11 13:35:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: You can stop it getting vandalised by just anyone can you not?
[2015/11/11 13:35:30] <Tobbi> I could
[2015/11/11 13:35:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe we should use the wiki, though.
[2015/11/11 13:35:40] <Tobbi> Now that I think about it.
[2015/11/11 13:35:47] <Karkus> I typed the newlines. But they're gone now
[2015/11/11 13:35:51] <Tobbi> Anyone here who does not have a wiki account?
[2015/11/11 13:36:03] <Karkus> Err... Me I think.
[2015/11/11 13:36:06] <Karkus> Let me check
[2015/11/11 13:36:27] <brmbrmcar> Done.
[2015/11/11 13:36:38] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: done what?
[2015/11/11 13:37:59] <brmbrmcar> Removed merge pull requests.

[2015/11/11 13:46:13] <maths22> about static linking
[2015/11/11 13:46:44] <mt> ok
[2015/11/11 13:47:23] <maths22> Also, once it is integrated into the offical repos, it should be triggered by a push
[2015/11/11 13:47:46] <Tobbi> maths22: How often will you trigger builds?
[2015/11/11 13:48:40] <maths22> Tobbi: once everything is working, there will be a set of pull requests (to tinygettext, squirrel, and supertux)
[2015/11/11 13:48:47] <maths22> After that, it will run on every commit
[2015/11/11 13:49:05] <maths22> it uses travis to handle the OS X and Linux builds
[2015/11/11 13:49:10] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 13:49:16] <maths22> AppVeyor is used to handle Windows
[2015/11/11 13:49:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: Mediawiki is great! It doesn't allow me to change a password for a user without access to a database.
[2015/11/11 13:49:42] <Tobbi> It only allows me to send a password reset email :D
[2015/11/11 13:50:10] <maths22> Also, I think I may change the upload name to include the commit hash (and only keep tags and the 10 most recent or something like that)
[2015/11/11 13:50:18] <maths22> I also need to fix the OSX icon
[2015/11/11 13:51:23] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: What's wrong with that?

[2015/11/11 13:55:31] <leyyin> maths22, any documentation on how you did the builds on travis? :D
[2015/11/11 13:57:40] <Tobbi> Oh! AppVeyor is free for opensource apps...
[2015/11/11 13:57:41] <Tobbi> Great!
[2015/11/11 13:58:43] <brmbrmcar> Free!
[2015/11/11 13:59:03] <head8debian> Yay! Polipo! :p
[2015/11/11 13:59:26] <brmbrmcar> Celebrate!
[2015/11/11 13:59:32] <brmbrmcar> :)
[2015/11/11 13:59:47] <Tobbi> We could actually assemble a list of people who contributed and update the credits.
[2015/11/11 14:00:03] <Tobbi> If the number of contributions is > n where n is a positive integeer.
[2015/11/11 14:00:06] <Tobbi> *integer
[2015/11/11 14:00:22] <leyyin> 2^128
[2015/11/11 14:00:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Contributions is a fairly arbitrary unit, isn't it?
[2015/11/11 14:01:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yeah, indeed.
[2015/11/11 14:01:12] <maths22> leyyin: No documentation yet.  I can write some up once I have cleaned up my .travis.yml to be less ugly
[2015/11/11 14:01:56] <brmbrmcar> brmbrmcar Absolutely Nothing
[2015/11/11 14:02:07] <leyyin> ah, I found it, thanks maths22
[2015/11/11 14:03:39] <maths22> I also need to re-enable debug builds, etc, but only make these binaries for the release one
[2015/11/11 14:04:12] <maths22> Also, I think my branch only works in LLVM, so I need to fix that
[2015/11/11 14:04:24] <Tobbi> Hah! The overall number of my commits to SuperTux is 444
[2015/11/11 14:04:41] <leyyin> nice, I did not know about the apt addon in travis, TIL
[2015/11/11 14:04:58] <maths22> leyyin: it is relatively new
[2015/11/11 14:05:02] <Karkus> Mine should soon rise to 9
[2015/11/11 14:05:33] <maths22> also, SDL2 is only in the offical repos on 14.04, so I have it build on 14.04 so we don't need to build it ourselves
[2015/11/11 14:06:05] <Karkus> maths22 is it building automatically each day?
[2015/11/11 14:06:08] <Tobbi> maths22: Wait, travis allows you to build on 14.04 now?
[2015/11/11 14:06:27] <maths22> see https://github.com/maths22/supertux/blob/master/.travis.yml
[2015/11/11 14:06:32] <maths22> Karkus: not yet
[2015/11/11 14:06:51] <Tobbi> That is great!
[2015/11/11 14:06:57] <maths22> Once I have everything working and polished up, I will submit a pull request to the official repository, and this will hopefully get integrated in
[2015/11/11 14:07:01] <Tobbi> Sure, thanks!
[2015/11/11 14:07:15] <maths22> Karkus: then it will run with every push
[2015/11/11 14:07:17] <Tobbi> maths22: Does that add-on do deps caching? I assume no?
[2015/11/11 14:07:38] <maths22> Tobbi: no, but it runs pretty fast
[2015/11/11 14:07:42] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 14:07:53] <maths22> Builds (with packaging and uploads) take ~7 minutes
[2015/11/11 14:08:05] <Karkus> maths22: Every push!?
[2015/11/11 14:08:08] <maths22> https://travis-ci.org/maths22/supertux
[2015/11/11 14:08:13] <maths22> Karkus: yep!
[2015/11/11 14:08:22] <maths22> It just adds a step to the end of travis
[2015/11/11 14:08:53] <leyyin> and now you can do mac build too, hmm
[2015/11/11 14:08:56] <leyyin> windows too? :D
[2015/11/11 14:09:11] <maths22> leyyin: windows through AppVeyor
[2015/11/11 14:09:12] <Tobbi> Who cares about Windows? :P
[2015/11/11 14:09:32] <maths22> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maths22/supertux
[2015/11/11 14:09:33] <brmbrmcar> I don't.
[2015/11/11 14:09:39] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I was being ironic.
[2015/11/11 14:09:40] <brmbrmcar> Who cares about OSX?
[2015/11/11 14:09:46] <brmbrmcar> You.
[2015/11/11 14:09:51] <maths22> Tobbi: people who use Windows
[2015/11/11 14:09:55] <maths22> brmbrmcar: people who use OSX
[2015/11/11 14:09:56] <maths22> :)
[2015/11/11 14:10:00] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/11 14:10:11] <brmbrmcar> I use Linux
[2015/11/11 14:10:18] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I figured
[2015/11/11 14:10:48] <brmbrmcar> There is no good alternative apart from browser operating systems.
[2015/11/11 14:10:53] <Karkus> Who cares about Linux
[2015/11/11 14:10:57] <Karkus> :P
[2015/11/11 14:11:01] <Karkus> jk
[2015/11/11 14:11:28] <maths22> I also created a new dependency zip that includes the newest boot and VC14 boost libraries
[2015/11/11 14:11:39] <leyyin> maths22, so this is the only file you need for appveyor https://github.com/maths22/supertux/blob/master/appveyor.yml ?
[2015/11/11 14:11:52] <maths22> leyyin: yes
[2015/11/11 14:12:27] <maths22> It is nice and clean
[2015/11/11 14:12:31] <Tobbi> maths22: Could you package our final release as well? Or rather build a release build when we want to release?
[2015/11/11 14:12:54] <maths22> Tobbi: I will have it keep tagged builds (and not clean them up)
[2015/11/11 14:13:01] <maths22> It will also name tagged builds differently
[2015/11/11 14:13:03] <Tobbi> Great!
[2015/11/11 14:13:15] <maths22> (How that will work, I'm not yet sure, but I'll figure it out)
[2015/11/11 14:13:30] * leyyin takes notes for STK
[2015/11/11 14:13:33] <maths22> Tobbi: it also only packages the release one
[2015/11/11 14:13:58] <maths22> Also, can we assemble a list of everywhere we use the version number (or development state, like the main logo)
[2015/11/11 14:14:23] <Tobbi> yeah, we should do that.
[2015/11/11 14:15:54] <Tobbi> By the way, guys: http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Changelog_0.4.0_%28WIP%29
[2015/11/11 14:16:21] <Tobbi> Karkus, mt, head8debian, maths22, brmbrmcar ^^ if you want to contribute
[2015/11/11 14:17:00] <Tobbi> We would need to pick the most important changes and create releases notes from them.
[2015/11/11 14:17:16] <maths22> Do we know of anywhere besides CMakeLists.txt and data/images/objects/logo/logo.sprite
[2015/11/11 14:17:17] <Tobbi> I suggest we keep out the xmas stuff though, in order to keep them a surprise.
[2015/11/11 14:17:46] <Tobbi> CMakeLists.txt
[2015/11/11 14:17:53] <Tobbi> it uses patch levels etc.
[2015/11/11 14:17:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: So this isn't the actual file, just a draft of things which have been added?
[2015/11/11 14:18:05] <Karkus> To be developed into that.
[2015/11/11 14:18:11] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, exactly.
[2015/11/11 14:18:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: However, I intend to just move the file once it's ready and supertux is about to be released.
[2015/11/11 14:20:09] <maths22> Tobbi: for releases, we can actually use http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/
[2015/11/11 14:20:24] <maths22> Tobbi: they will then go straight into github
[2015/11/11 14:20:38] <maths22> I will mess with that feature later
[2015/11/11 14:21:20] <Tobbi> maths22: How would those be triggered? We just add tags?
[2015/11/11 14:21:46] <maths22> I believe so
[2015/11/11 14:22:04] <maths22> I'll investigate tonight
[2015/11/11 14:22:12] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/11 14:23:08] <leyyin> maths22, only the new containers are 14.04? not the old infrastructure
[2015/11/11 14:27:30] <leyyin> actually we can do windows cross compiling on linux, who needs windows anyways :P
[2015/11/11 14:27:41] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/11 14:27:47] <Tobbi> leyyin: well, I use it regularly...
[2015/11/11 14:29:18] <maths22> leyyin: i actually was going to cross-comple, but then I discovered appveyor
[2015/11/11 14:29:51] <leyyin> one problem I think it is, how you can upload the bundles securely to your file server
[2015/11/11 14:30:04] <leyyin> so that no one can hijack the upload, and upload something malicious
[2015/11/11 14:30:37] <maths22> the key will be changed and moved on an encrypted envvar

[2015/11/11 14:59:24] <Tobbi> sounds good!
[2015/11/11 14:59:40] <maths22> Actually, github does that for us
[2015/11/11 14:59:42] <maths22> never mind that
[2015/11/11 15:02:33] <Tobbi> hmm.
[2015/11/11 15:05:03] <brmbrmcar> I looked through all the projects,

[2015/11/11 15:06:23] <Tobbi> maths22: No, it's a webhook (called Notifico)
[2015/11/11 15:06:56] <maths22> OK.  I know GitHub has a decent one built in
[2015/11/11 15:07:06] <maths22> You could probably kill Notifico and enable it if you wanted to
[2015/11/11 15:07:17] <Tobbi> Yeah, or create my own Notifico account.

[2015/11/11 15:47:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: Wow... google did it. Chrome will no longer support XP OR Vista starting in april of next year...
[2015/11/11 15:47:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: Does firefox still support it?
[2015/11/11 15:47:49] <brmbrmcar> Support what?
[2015/11/11 15:48:07] <brmbrmcar> Oh XP.
[2015/11/11 15:48:26] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/11 15:48:28] <brmbrmcar> Why?
[2015/11/11 15:48:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes.
[2015/11/11 15:48:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: And they have not made any moves to stop supporting it.
[2015/11/11 15:48:54] <Tobbi> Which is good. At least they did something right
[2015/11/11 15:50:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: :p
[2015/11/11 15:50:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: No one should be supporting xp...

[2015/11/11 15:50:25] <brmbrmcar> Do thay support Windows 1.0?
[2015/11/11 15:50:33] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: haha, no.
[2015/11/11 15:51:00] <head8debian> XP is just so crusty...
[2015/11/11 15:51:08] <brmbrmcar> Do they support Chrome OS?
[2015/11/11 15:51:16] <head8debian> I think debian Jessie is old. :p
[2015/11/11 15:51:27] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: I don't know. I doubt it.
[2015/11/11 15:52:03] <brmbrmcar> Soon all Android apps will work, so that means Firefox. :D
[2015/11/11 15:52:58] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Or chrome will merge with android. :)
[2015/11/11 15:53:35] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2015/11/11 15:53:44] <brmbrmcar> But in the meantime...
[2015/11/11 15:56:08] <brmbrmcar> Firefox!

[2015/11/11 17:03:02] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/11 17:05:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: Can we have multiplayer (on a single keyboard) as part of supertux 3?
[2015/11/11 17:05:38] <Tobbi> Sounds good. File an issue.
[2015/11/11 17:05:43] <Tobbi> We'd also need sprites...
[2015/11/11 17:05:51] <Tobbi> I mean: We need a different player sprite.
[2015/11/11 17:05:55] <Tobbi> and animations and everything.
[2015/11/11 17:05:56] <Karkus> ik
[2015/11/11 17:06:11] <Karkus> But I guess for now we could recolor tux in gimp
[2015/11/11 17:06:19] <Karkus> takes a couple seconds
[2015/11/11 17:06:50] <Tobbi> Possibly, sure.
[2015/11/11 17:07:04] <Tobbi> but since this is for SuperTux 3 anyway...
[2015/11/11 17:07:14] <Tobbi> Karkus: It'd mean split screen, right?
[2015/11/11 17:07:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: TBC
[2015/11/11 17:07:26] <Karkus> To Be Considered
[2015/11/11 17:07:31] <Karkus> In this sense
[2015/11/11 17:07:33] <Tobbi> sounds fun.
[2015/11/11 17:07:34] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 17:08:06] <Karkus> In the Mario games (I know I talk about these a lot) it's not split screen.
[2015/11/11 17:08:25] <Tobbi> I finally (!!) managed to update the add-on index.
[2015/11/11 17:08:27] <Karkus> Split screen would be infinity times harder to implement
[2015/11/11 17:08:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Index?
[2015/11/11 17:08:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: But if one player is faster than the other?
[2015/11/11 17:08:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: I added head8debian's worldmap changes for rubberduck
[2015/11/11 17:09:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: Then the slower gets crushed on the screen
[2015/11/11 17:09:12] <Tobbi> uhm...okay?
[2015/11/11 17:09:13] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 17:09:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Great! Can you now close the issue?
[2015/11/11 17:09:18] <Tobbi> Oh, of course.
[2015/11/11 17:09:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Have you really never played those games
[2015/11/11 17:09:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: To be honest, no! :D
[2015/11/11 17:09:40] <Karkus> New Super Mario Wii etc.

[2015/11/11 17:10:45] <Karkus> Tobbi: We could actually have many players if we used the game controllers
[2015/11/11 17:10:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: Do you own a game controller? :D
[2015/11/11 17:11:04] <Tobbi> Because I don't and thus can't test support for that.
[2015/11/11 17:11:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: I... don't know...
[2015/11/11 17:11:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: What *is* a game controller which is compatible?
[2015/11/11 17:11:38] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/11 17:12:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's an SDL thing isn't it?
[2015/11/11 17:12:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: indeed.
[2015/11/11 17:13:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have also been thinking about a website where people can submit their add-ons. We review them and we can auto-push them to the game.
[2015/11/11 17:13:53] <Tobbi> That would be fun.
[2015/11/11 17:13:56] <Tobbi> No more editing nfo files.
[2015/11/11 17:14:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Definately
[2015/11/11 17:14:05] <Karkus> https://youtu.be/pipMu0HXiU0?t=50s
[2015/11/11 17:14:09] <Karkus> That one maybe
[2015/11/11 17:15:37] <Tobbi> Interesting.
[2015/11/11 17:15:44] <Tobbi> So, maybe not that hard to implement.
[2015/11/11 17:19:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: Playing with other people over the internet could be fun :D
[2015/11/11 17:19:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: It would, yes
[2015/11/11 17:20:34] <Karkus> I think we could have a huge leader board with top levels created by people all over the place
[2015/11/11 17:20:50] <Karkus> And then you can play them. Multiplayer, too
[2015/11/11 17:21:03] <Karkus> Compete for time or secrets etc.
[2015/11/11 17:21:04] <Tobbi> That would be great.
[2015/11/11 17:21:08] <Tobbi> But also alot of work.
[2015/11/11 17:21:14] <Tobbi> But maybe we'll get people to contribute after 0.4.0
[2015/11/11 17:21:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: No kidding
[2015/11/11 17:21:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: But that's a good thing for a roadmap.
[2015/11/11 17:22:40] <Karkus> Well, top priority after 0.4.0, for me at least, is flexlay. The problem is I think the code is too annoying. I'm not saying I could do better, but I think I could.
[2015/11/11 17:23:15] <Karkus> It's all a bit disorganised

[2015/11/11 17:29:19] <Karkus> I worry about getting rid of so much code, but it's always on branch master if we need it
[2015/11/11 17:29:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't think there's any reason. So, you can go ahead.

[2015/11/11 17:33:44] <Tobbi> Some of the German translations are so...bad...
[2015/11/11 17:34:07] <Tobbi> "Take your pick" -> <translates as if someone would take an actual "pick">
[2015/11/11 17:34:15] <Tobbi> You know...ice pick for example.
[2015/11/11 17:36:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: tooth pick
[2015/11/11 17:36:18] <Karkus> ?

[2015/11/12 10:22:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: Good morning.
[2015/11/12 10:22:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: We had a power outage all morning...
[2015/11/12 10:22:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: Including yourself?
[2015/11/12 10:23:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes?
[2015/11/12 10:24:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: No electric = cannot milk cows...
[2015/11/12 10:24:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: I know, cows don't work... Cows are a direct result of electricity...
[2015/11/12 10:24:51] <Tobbi> Actually, first the electricity, then the cow.
[2015/11/12 10:24:59] <Tobbi> Perfect symbioses.
[2015/11/12 10:25:03] <Tobbi> *symbiosis
[2015/11/12 10:25:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: :p
[2015/11/12 10:25:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: We could milk them by hand, but its hard to do 100 cows by hand. :)
[2015/11/12 10:25:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: Have you ever sold forged harddisks and cholesterol?
[2015/11/12 10:25:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, no?
[2015/11/12 10:26:05] <Tobbi> alright.
[2015/11/12 10:26:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: And we have roughly 100,000 turkeys being fed around us also, which cannot be fed without electricity.
[2015/11/12 10:26:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: ever tried?
[2015/11/12 10:26:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: I notice that when you put a turkey in a hot stove (= electricity) it tasts better afterwards.
[2015/11/12 10:27:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: I'd rather cook it over a gas stove. :D
[2015/11/12 10:27:17] <head8debian> Much more eficient.
[2015/11/12 10:27:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Gas hasn't been invented yet around here.
[2015/11/12 10:28:18] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/12 10:29:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, basically, whenever we want to cook something, we have people who rotate sticks in order for hay to catch fire.
[2015/11/12 10:29:29] <Tobbi> or something.
[2015/11/12 10:29:41] <Tobbi> Because, we don't know how to deal with electricity.
[2015/11/12 10:29:46] <Tobbi> Sometimes it's there, sometimes it isn't.
[2015/11/12 10:29:55] <Tobbi> Sometimes it's too strong, sometimes it's too low.
[2015/11/12 10:30:10] <Tobbi> Sometimes it's an amoeba.
[2015/11/12 10:31:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm.
[2015/11/12 10:31:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: Us americans find it quite reliable. :D
[2015/11/12 10:32:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: says the one with a power outage.
[2015/11/12 10:32:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its back on now...
[2015/11/12 10:32:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: So twice a year it goes out for a couple hours.
[2015/11/12 10:33:12] <head8debian> It seems to be just with our electricity line.
[2015/11/12 10:33:25] <head8debian> the neighbors never lose electricity.
[2015/11/12 10:33:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Have you ever tried to stack cows on top of each other? In theory that should give you more energy, since there's more potential energy.

[2015/11/12 10:41:11] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 10:48:34] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/12 11:00:47] <mt> Tobbi: it was me who set up notifico, but when there's no option in the "Webhooks & services" section I can't change anything (w/o modifying notifico and then running it on my own server)
[2015/11/12 11:01:03] <mt> I can disable it, but...
[2015/11/12 11:01:18] <Tobbi> mt: hmm...okay, so there's really nothing we can do, for now...
[2015/11/12 11:01:45] <Tobbi> We could ask github to give us fine-grained control.
[2015/11/12 11:01:50] <Tobbi> but that's asking too much, I assume.
[2015/11/12 11:02:19] <mt> Yeah
[2015/11/12 11:03:00] <mt> what wouldn't be asking too much of github would be include all label changes in, say the last minute, in one event
[2015/11/12 11:03:15] <mt> but that would - in the end - also require updating notifico's code

[2015/11/12 11:42:35] <head8debian> Its expensive...
[2015/11/12 11:42:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: Wow, you're growing up to be an ordinary person.
[2015/11/12 11:42:37] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/12 11:43:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, whats that mean?
[2015/11/12 11:43:13] <Tobbi> head8debian: What it means.
[2015/11/12 11:43:17] <brmbrmcar> I hate paying for music.
[2015/11/12 11:44:01] <head8debian> I figured i'd better support support the bands i listen to. Keeps them in buisiness. :)
[2015/11/12 11:45:27] <brmbrmcar> I never buy music.
[2015/11/12 11:45:47] <brmbrmcar> Why would I :P
[2015/11/12 11:46:56] <mt> In Germany, torrenting music is like paying 500 € for a CD
[2015/11/12 11:47:11] <head8debian> mt: Why?
[2015/11/12 11:47:14] <mt> heck, even more
[2015/11/12 11:47:19] <head8debian> Bandwidth that expensive? :p
[2015/11/12 11:47:33] <head8debian> I don't torrent it. Or use any odd websites...
[2015/11/12 11:47:38] <mt> because you'll get an Abmahnung (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abmahnung)
[2015/11/12 11:48:07] <head8debian> Ouch.
[2015/11/12 11:48:16] <brmbrmcar> If I want music, I download a high quality version from Youtube.
[2015/11/12 11:48:26] <brmbrmcar> Completely illegal, but who cares.
[2015/11/12 11:48:37] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Same here... ;)

[2015/11/12 11:48:55] <mt> Sadly, high quality music from youtube or even bought from itunes/google play/amazon isn't really high quality
[2015/11/12 11:48:55] <head8debian> Our church half hinges on youtube...
[2015/11/12 11:49:12] <head8debian> mt: I know what you mean.

[2015/11/12 11:49:29] <head8debian> mt: If i buy music from amazon does the band even get a percent of it?
[2015/11/12 11:49:44] <head8debian> percent of the profit*
[2015/11/12 11:49:52] <mt> dunno
[2015/11/12 11:49:56] <leyyin> I buy music from my local dealer :D
[2015/11/12 11:49:57] <leyyin> it's free
[2015/11/12 11:50:15] <head8debian> I usually listen to the radio...
[2015/11/12 11:50:24] <leyyin> head8debian, you drive a lot?
[2015/11/12 11:50:25] <brmbrmcar> But these days, quality of CDs is actually getting worse, as most people write to MP3 when making it.
[2015/11/12 11:51:03] <mt> I still know of studios using magnet tape for recording and mastering
[2015/11/12 11:51:09] <head8debian> leyyin: A decent amount. Not much though.
[2015/11/12 11:51:31] <leyyin> radio listening is only when driving :P
[2015/11/12 11:51:41] <head8debian> mt: Alof of studios i know keep it digital as much as possible.
[2015/11/12 11:51:57] <head8debian> Record high quality as digital.
[2015/11/12 11:52:00] <leyyin> if it's lossless, then it's fine
[2015/11/12 11:52:51] <head8debian> As long as it doesn't sound awfull im fine with it. :p
[2015/11/12 11:53:09] <brmbrmcar> Why do people listen to the radio when driving?
[2015/11/12 11:53:29] <brmbrmcar> I listen to all the bumps and creaks!
[2015/11/12 11:53:34] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/11/12 11:53:56] <brmbrmcar> Way better. :D

[2015/11/12 12:02:37] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Vehicle? Or motor?
[2015/11/12 12:02:44] <brmbrmcar> Vehichle.
[2015/11/12 12:02:44] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: A V10.
[2015/11/12 12:02:51] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Ford Excursion.
[2015/11/12 12:03:05] <brmbrmcar> How old?
[2015/11/12 12:03:12] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: 13 years.
[2015/11/12 12:03:17] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: quack it. :p
[2015/11/12 12:03:59] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: The other vehicle is a 2001 Dodge Ram. 24 valve. 6 cylinder Diesel.
[2015/11/12 12:04:21] <head8debian> Actually, its an 8 cylinder.
[2015/11/12 12:04:25] <head8debian> Cummins. :D
[2015/11/12 12:04:59] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/12 12:05:02] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: quack it = look it up on duckduckgo...
[2015/11/12 12:05:08] <brmbrmcar> Both bad for cras tests.
[2015/11/12 12:05:22] <brmbrmcar> That's what I wanted to know.
[2015/11/12 12:05:22] <head8debian> nope, its a 6 valve.
[2015/11/12 12:05:28] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: FOr what?
[2015/11/12 12:05:36] <brmbrmcar> Crashing.
[2015/11/12 12:05:39] <brmbrmcar> Safety.
[2015/11/12 12:05:50] <head8debian> We don't have emissions test and other junk up here... thankfully.
[2015/11/12 12:06:10] <brmbrmcar> Where are you?
[2015/11/12 12:06:13] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Uhm, these vehicles are much safer in a crash than any car.
[2015/11/12 12:06:22] <head8debian> Northern USA?
[2015/11/12 12:06:36] <brmbrmcar> Not into something like a tree.
[2015/11/12 12:06:56] <mt> sadly you don't have emissions tests
[2015/11/12 12:07:01] <brmbrmcar> And also Safe small is better than Dangerous big.
[2015/11/12 12:07:40] <head8debian> brmbrmcar:I dissagree. Do you want to meet a semi with a car or with a truck? Do you want to meet a truck with a car or another truck?
[2015/11/12 12:07:52] <head8debian> Without all the emissions crud Diesels could get 20mpg.
[2015/11/12 12:08:02] <head8debian> Currently they get about 11mpg.
[2015/11/12 12:08:04] <head8debian> mt: o_O
[2015/11/12 12:08:08] <brmbrmcar> Watch the
[2015/11/12 12:08:54] <head8debian> mt: If you show me some sort of emissions stuff that actually works on a diesel engine, then maybei  will change my mind.
[2015/11/12 12:09:01] <head8debian> I understand the CAT converter on a car.

[2015/11/12 12:10:12] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: And up here where we get so much snow you don't want to have a car. You will get stuck before you can blink on half these roads.
[2015/11/12 12:10:51] <head8debian> Also, explain to my why its considered better for the enviroment to have the engine burn twice as much fuel for the same result vs half the fuel for the same result.
[2015/11/12 12:11:40] <brmbrmcar> Anything can go through snow if you are brave.
[2015/11/12 12:12:01] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: LOL. ;)

[2015/11/12 12:12:43] <head8debian> 2ft snow vs car vs truck with 4wd.
[2015/11/12 12:13:03] <head8debian> mt: Well good. Im glad we are not that way.
[2015/11/12 12:14:23] <head8debian> I hate all the electronics in these new cars. Sure they are great while they work, but they are so expensive when they break.
[2015/11/12 12:15:09] <head8debian> Every farmer and person ive talked to that know how this stuff actually works have nothing good to say about it.
[2015/11/12 12:15:18] <head8debian> And neither do i...
[2015/11/12 12:15:45] <brmbrmcar> I want one with an electromagnet to repel other vehichles when they are too close.

[2015/11/12 12:17:04] <brmbrmcar> Easy.
[2015/11/12 12:17:16] <brmbrmcar> More tourque.
[2015/11/12 12:17:30] <head8debian> Which is why you have a truck. :)
[2015/11/12 12:18:36] <brmbrmcar> Trucks never have as much torque as sport vehichles.

[2015/11/12 12:25:45] <brmbrmcar> Are they pets?
[2015/11/12 12:25:56] <head8debian> Tobbi should buy a goat to trim his lawn and eat his trash...
[2015/11/12 12:26:04] <head8debian> They like old fruit better though.

[2015/11/12 12:31:33] <brmbrmcar> Do the goats have restraints?
[2015/11/12 12:31:49] <head8debian> Wheat has never been genetically modified. :D
[2015/11/12 12:32:04] <head8debian> Im no GMO nut. We do what we have to to feed everyone.
[2015/11/12 12:32:12] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Pastures? Yes.
[2015/11/12 12:32:21] <brmbrmcar> Not that.
[2015/11/12 12:32:41] <brmbrmcar> Like safety belts for the back of the truck.
[2015/11/12 12:33:06] <brmbrmcar> THe big one.
[2015/11/12 12:33:45] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Uhm, we don't move them unless we need to. When they need to be moved they get a trailer that is open inside and they lay down while we are moving.
[2015/11/12 12:34:03] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/12 12:34:47] <head8debian> Animals have very quiet and comfortable and lazy lives. :)
[2015/11/12 12:34:57] <Tobbi> Depends on the animal.
[2015/11/12 12:35:02] <head8debian> True.
[2015/11/12 12:35:07] <head8debian> Most domestic ones do.
[2015/11/12 12:35:14] <head8debian> Dairy animals mostly..

[2015/11/12 12:35:38] <head8debian> Eat, sleep, poop, get milked, thats their life. :D

[2015/11/12 12:38:20] <Tobbi> about that subject.
[2015/11/12 12:38:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes, america fast paced...sadly.
[2015/11/12 12:38:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: What a coincidence. :p
[2015/11/12 12:38:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why coincidence?
[2015/11/12 12:39:04] <head8debian> You know nothing, yet he knows everything, yet you can call it by a name. ;)
[2015/11/12 12:39:09] <head8debian> nm...
[2015/11/12 12:39:27] <head8debian> Our family is much slower paced IMHO.
[2015/11/12 12:39:52] <brmbrmcar> Accelerator! Accelerator!
[2015/11/12 12:39:58] <head8debian> Its nice. :)
[2015/11/12 12:40:31] @ Quit: xet7: Quit: Leaving
[2015/11/12 12:42:23] <brmbrmcar> What is?
[2015/11/12 12:46:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzCf2RJHNSw
[2015/11/12 12:48:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: Is your police really that...strict?
[2015/11/12 12:52:21] <brmbrmcar> POLICE!!!
[2015/11/12 12:54:23] <brmbrmcar> Oh my god.
[2015/11/12 12:54:29] <brmbrmcar> That is bad.
[2015/11/12 12:55:27] @ alket joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/12 12:57:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, what did the motercyclist do in the last part?
[2015/11/12 12:58:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: I really don't know.
[2015/11/12 12:58:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Usually its about like the first half, maybe slightly more strict. We don't allow drag racing, and it is dangerous, especially on our roads.
[2015/11/12 12:58:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, I have to admit that I think it might be an unfair comparison.
[2015/11/12 12:58:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: He had to have done something pretty bad to have been treated like that.
[2015/11/12 12:58:46] <Tobbi> Probablz.
[2015/11/12 12:58:51] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2015/11/12 12:59:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, I got stopped by the police once. For going too fast. I was in quite a hurry...
[2015/11/12 12:59:21] <head8debian> Yes. We have accedentally once also.
[2015/11/12 12:59:26] <head8debian> And a couple flat tires.
[2015/11/12 12:59:48] <Tobbi> I needed to get dressed properly...and we had a choral concert... So, of course I was going 60 in a 30 speed limit zone.
[2015/11/12 12:59:50] <head8debian> Police are not mean over here, but im sure they can seem ruder than they are.
[2015/11/12 13:00:00] <head8debian> Yeah... ouch.
[2015/11/12 13:00:09] <Tobbi> So, I explained to the officer that I was in quite a hurry, and fortunately he didn't give me a ticket.
[2015/11/12 13:00:25] <head8debian> Ok, thats a easy let off. We get a warning. ;)
[2015/11/12 13:00:31] <head8debian> Then a ticket.
[2015/11/12 13:00:40] <brmbrmcar> I am scared of the US!
[2015/11/12 13:00:50] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Me too! :D
[2015/11/12 13:00:51] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/12 13:01:27] <brmbrmcar> All the death penalties!
[2015/11/12 13:01:34] <head8debian> But our police are not bad. If everyone else is going 75 and your going 77 you wont get pulled over...
[2015/11/12 13:01:37] <Tobbi> Oh, yeah, that...
[2015/11/12 13:01:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: In kph, please.
[2015/11/12 13:01:48] <brmbrmcar> I am glad I don't live there.
[2015/11/12 13:01:55] <brmbrmcar> No offence.
[2015/11/12 13:02:11] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Oh brother. There have not been many death offences in the US. Too few IMHO.
[2015/11/12 13:02:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm...
[2015/11/12 13:02:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't know KMph...
[2015/11/12 13:02:30] <Tobbi> okay...
[2015/11/12 13:02:51] <brmbrmcar> I do.
[2015/11/12 13:03:04] <head8debian> We feed some of these criminals their whole life through our taxes and they sit in jail and watch TV all day...
[2015/11/12 13:03:13] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/11/12 13:03:13] <brmbrmcar> 123 km/h
[2015/11/12 13:03:15] <Tobbi> "One of the shortest words in the German dictionary is Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz, for example, which loosely means “No”."
[2015/11/12 13:03:18] <head8debian> Our jails are quite crowded atm.
[2015/11/12 13:03:29] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, are you for or against the death penalty?
[2015/11/12 13:03:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: Can you explain it better to me?
[2015/11/12 13:04:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: Explain what?
[2015/11/12 13:04:17] <head8debian> The death penalty. ;)
[2015/11/12 13:04:26] <head8debian> I don't hear much about it.
[2015/11/12 13:04:33] <head8debian> nm.
[2015/11/12 13:05:02] <head8debian> This is getting awkward...
[2015/11/12 13:05:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: Uhm, you're the one living in the US?
[2015/11/12 13:05:18] * head8debian also wonders why he has headphones on and is not listening to anything.
[2015/11/12 13:05:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do they have the death penalty in Michigan?
[2015/11/12 13:06:02] <leyyin> also Europe is the main cause a lot of states are abolishing the death penalty
[2015/11/12 13:06:19] <leyyin> because only Europe produces the drugs and we refuse to sell them anymore
[2015/11/12 13:06:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im not sure if death is the correct way to go, but i don't like it that we have so many people sitting in jail.
[2015/11/12 13:06:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: IIRC we don't.
[2015/11/12 13:06:29] <Tobbi> leyyin: Which is good!
[2015/11/12 13:06:33] <leyyin> Tobbi, agree
[2015/11/12 13:06:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: however, Texas apparently still gets their drugs from somewhere else...
[2015/11/12 13:06:55] <leyyin> Tobbi, ilegally
[2015/11/12 13:07:01] <Tobbi> Probably, yeah.
[2015/11/12 13:07:10] <leyyin> only Europe sells those drugs legally
[2015/11/12 13:07:14] <leyyin> "sold" :D
[2015/11/12 13:07:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: I believe Hospira even stopped producing Pentobarbital...
[2015/11/12 13:07:19] <head8debian> Of course illegally! They will get them weather you allow it or not. Its human nature.
[2015/11/12 13:07:24] <Tobbi> Or what it's called.
[2015/11/12 13:07:36] <head8debian> Sadly...
[2015/11/12 13:07:47] <leyyin> also, texas ;)
[2015/11/12 13:07:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's a government ffs. They have to abide by the law...
[2015/11/12 13:07:49] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/12 13:07:52] <leyyin> the hill billy country
[2015/11/12 13:07:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: I wouldn't want to live there.
[2015/11/12 13:08:23] <leyyin> me neither, you should avoid southern states in murica anyway
[2015/11/12 13:08:36] <leyyin> Florida especially :D
[2015/11/12 13:08:39] <Tobbi> leyyin: Still, I regularly search the news about death penalty. Morbid curiosity...
[2015/11/12 13:08:40] <head8debian> The Bible also says "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth", so i have always belived that that mean 'a life for a life'. But i do belive self defence is one exception.
[2015/11/12 13:08:59] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh, c'mon, please. That principle is what Texas goes by...
[2015/11/12 13:09:00] <leyyin> head8debian, are you jew?
[2015/11/12 13:09:13] <leyyin> only jews apply that law
[2015/11/12 13:09:16] <leyyin> christians do not
[2015/11/12 13:09:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: Society evolves.
[2015/11/12 13:09:21] <head8debian> They are trying to allow marajuanna(or how ever its written) up here.
[2015/11/12 13:09:25] <leyyin> because Jesus told us to love
[2015/11/12 13:09:34] <Tobbi> Marihuana...
[2015/11/12 13:09:43] <head8debian> leyyin: *real* christians do, "christians" don't.
[2015/11/12 13:09:49] <leyyin> "An Eye for an Eye Will Make the Whole World Blind"
[2015/11/12 13:09:55] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/12 13:10:19] <Tobbi> We're at that topic again (religion)
[2015/11/12 13:10:28] <leyyin> Tobbi, yes, you heathen ;)
[2015/11/12 13:10:34] <head8debian> I don't know why anyone considers themselves a Christian when they don't even trust the Bible.
[2015/11/12 13:10:40] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/12 13:10:46] <leyyin> head8debian, are you mad that Starbucks changed their cup?
[2015/11/12 13:10:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: I am not a heathen. I am baptized and confirmed.
[2015/11/12 13:11:17] <head8debian> leyyin: They did? I dont keep track of stuff like that.
[2015/11/12 13:11:24] <leyyin> Tobbi, obvious trying to get under your skin joke, captain obvious ;)
[2015/11/12 13:11:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Catholic? Baby baptised?

[2015/11/12 13:11:46] <head8debian> NO YOUTUBE VIDEOS!
[2015/11/12 13:11:47] <Tobbi> Who cares about religion anyway.
[2015/11/12 13:11:52] <leyyin> head8debian, why not?
[2015/11/12 13:12:06] <leyyin> I worked at youtube for 3 months ;)
[2015/11/12 13:12:17] @ head8debian left channel #supertux ("ttyl...")
[2015/11/12 13:12:29] <leyyin> he left because of me
[2015/11/12 13:12:31] <Tobbi> what?
[2015/11/12 13:12:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: I thought it was because of me.
[2015/11/12 13:12:36] <leyyin> ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED
[2015/11/12 13:12:46] <leyyin> Tobbi, do you want to fight over it?
[2015/11/12 13:12:50] * leyyin punches Tobbi 
[2015/11/12 13:12:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, got better stuff to do.
[2015/11/12 13:13:03] <Tobbi> I don't need violence to fight you, leyyin.
[2015/11/12 13:13:16] <Tobbi> Violence is bad anyway.
[2015/11/12 13:13:17] <Tobbi> I got my chainsaw always with me.
[2015/11/12 13:13:25] * leyyin runs
[2015/11/12 13:13:27] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:14:10] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, the problem with religion is that it's supposed to be a moral guidance, somewhat, but it often claims to be so much more.
[2015/11/12 13:14:28] <red_bot> /me chases tobbi with his chainsaw...
[2015/11/12 13:14:30] <Tobbi> And people who are really religious don't get that it's all open to interpretation and can be seen more or less strict.
[2015/11/12 13:14:35] <Tobbi> red_bot: Stop!
[2015/11/12 13:14:55] <red_bot> Tobbi: What? :p
[2015/11/12 13:15:16] <Tobbi> red_bot: If you want to be like brm brm car and pretend to ragequit only to read the logs...

[2015/11/12 13:17:21] <head8debian> I wanted to. :D
[2015/11/12 13:17:33] <leyyin> and why no youtube videos?

[2015/11/12 13:21:05] <head8debian> And take it as a compliment...

[2015/11/12 13:37:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do you like English?
[2015/11/12 13:37:18] <brmbrmcar> Which I hate.
[2015/11/12 13:37:30] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have grown to like it. It's really elegant.
[2015/11/12 13:37:35] <Tobbi> In a way.
[2015/11/12 13:37:37] <Karkus> Elegant?
[2015/11/12 13:37:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: The language flow is different...
[2015/11/12 13:37:51] <Karkus> It breaks all the rules all the time!?
[2015/11/12 13:38:00] <Tobbi> Karkus: But it sounds so...flowy...
[2015/11/12 13:38:01] <Karkus> German follows rules
[2015/11/12 13:38:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: In Britain everyone thinks german people sound angry
[2015/11/12 13:38:41] <brmbrmcar> I hate when they teach spelling rules for English that aren't ever right.
[2015/11/12 13:38:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: We don't only sound angry, we are angry. When we're not angry, we're not in any way conscious.
[2015/11/12 13:39:00] <brmbrmcar> I don't think German people sound amgry.
[2015/11/12 13:39:08] <Karkus> "'I' before 'E' except after 'C'"
[2015/11/12 13:39:10] <brmbrmcar> s/amgry/angry/
[2015/11/12 13:39:10] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "I don't think German people sound angry."
[2015/11/12 13:39:34] <brmbrmcar> I before E except after blank is better.
[2015/11/12 13:39:51] * head8debian rolls his eyes...
[2015/11/12 13:40:06] <head8debian> School in IRC on top of normal school. ugg.
[2015/11/12 13:40:54] <brmbrmcar> Schoolis horrible.IRC school is not.
[2015/11/12 13:42:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: "I before E except after C? Is that an official rule? What about "riechen" then?
[2015/11/12 13:42:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's an english rule
[2015/11/12 13:42:25] <Tobbi> ah!
[2015/11/12 13:42:25] <Karkus> Reich?
[2015/11/12 13:42:35] <Tobbi> No, not rich.... riechen = to smell.
[2015/11/12 13:42:39] <head8debian> Yes, its a actual english rule. Helps with writing.
[2015/11/12 13:42:51] <Karkus> Weight? Height?
[2015/11/12 13:42:58] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/12 13:42:58] <Karkus> Sleight
[2015/11/12 13:43:00] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, also what you might need in your everyday life: Nutritional supplement = Nahrungsergänzungsmittel.
[2015/11/12 13:43:11] <head8debian> No, wieght. :p
[2015/11/12 13:43:22] <Karkus> Food Poisoning = Lebensmittelvergiftung
[2015/11/12 13:43:25] <head8debian> How can you remember how to spell that?
[2015/11/12 13:43:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: Very good!
[2015/11/12 13:43:33] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:43:39] <Karkus> Transport links = Vehrkersverbindungen
[2015/11/12 13:43:45] <Karkus> If I spelled that right?
[2015/11/12 13:43:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: the "h" is at the wrong place.
[2015/11/12 13:43:53] <Karkus> Verkehr?
[2015/11/12 13:43:57] <Tobbi> Yes!
[2015/11/12 13:44:16] <Karkus> I haven't used either of those, ever
[2015/11/12 13:44:27] <Karkus> Hmmm, 'use'
[2015/11/12 13:44:29] <Tobbi> What a shame.
[2015/11/12 13:44:31] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:44:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I play Scrabble with my English lecturer at college every 2 weeks.
[2015/11/12 13:44:51] <brmbrmcar> brmbrmauto
[2015/11/12 13:44:52] <Tobbi> It's nice.
[2015/11/12 13:44:59] <Karkus> head8debian: If you can say it, you can spell it.
[2015/11/12 13:45:00] <head8debian> o-O
[2015/11/12 13:45:17] <head8debian> I haven no clue where to even begin pronouncing it.
[2015/11/12 13:45:36] <Karkus> Fer ker sfer bind ung en?
[2015/11/12 13:45:39] <brmbrmcar> Fer ker
[2015/11/12 13:45:43] <head8debian> I have enough issues pronouncing that oddball car dealer down the road's name.
[2015/11/12 13:45:48] <brmbrmcar> Karkus!
[2015/11/12 13:45:52] <brmbrmcar> Copycat!
[2015/11/12 13:45:54] <head8debian> :-)

[2015/11/12 13:46:25] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Sprechen Sie Deutsch?

[2015/11/12 13:47:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: Wait, I showed you this before, right?
[2015/11/12 13:48:00] <head8debian> Karkus: Not sean it? ;p
[2015/11/12 13:48:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yepp
[2015/11/12 13:48:18] <head8debian> I still don't understand why sean is pronounced Shawn.
[2015/11/12 13:48:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, now something you might not have seen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaJtjJNrWf0

[2015/11/12 13:48:54] <head8debian> Karkus: How is that pronounced?
[2015/11/12 13:49:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: And it wasn't me who showed you that, right?
[2015/11/12 13:49:03] <Karkus> Sheh vawn
[2015/11/12 13:49:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Not this time, no
[2015/11/12 13:49:14] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/12 13:49:36] <brmbrmcar> Morrisons is a rubbish shop.
[2015/11/12 13:50:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't mind. Once I was told a story by a friend about something they did with their friend. Who happened to be me. -.-
[2015/11/12 13:50:09] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:51:11] <maths22> I'm working now on setting up OpenBuildService for the linux builds

[2015/11/12 13:53:04] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/12 13:53:48] <brmbrmcar> English is hard!
[2015/11/12 13:54:44] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So it's not your native language?
[2015/11/12 13:56:24] <brmbrmcar> It is.
[2015/11/12 13:57:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is Backpfeifengesicht a word?

[2015/11/12 13:58:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: You should rather not use it.
[2015/11/12 13:58:34] <Karkus> subtle is another stupid English spelling
[2015/11/12 13:58:35] <brmbrmcar> Longest word.
[2015/11/12 13:58:47] <head8debian> lol.

[2015/11/12 13:58:58] <brmbrmcar> I dare not say the full chemical name of Titin.
[2015/11/12 13:59:11] <brmbrmcar> But I would if talking about it.
[2015/11/12 13:59:37] <brmbrmcar> I know nothing about Titin.
[2015/11/12 14:00:06] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: its a protein, thats all i know.
[2015/11/12 14:00:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: What are the German views on the Second World War? Is it rude to talk about or make fun of it?
[2015/11/12 14:00:46] <Karkus> Specifically Germany
[2015/11/12 14:00:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's a really good question...I believe it's kind of a taboo subject here, still...
[2015/11/12 14:01:19] <Tobbi> We don't make fun of it.
[2015/11/12 14:01:34] <head8debian> We don't either.
[2015/11/12 14:01:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't mean in a disrespectful way.
[2015/11/12 14:01:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: Problem is: Because of the refugee crisis, the right-wing parties get more attration.
[2015/11/12 14:01:38] <head8debian> I don't think.
[2015/11/12 14:01:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's perfectly alright.
[2015/11/12 14:02:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, what about this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDeG4S-mJts

[2015/11/12 14:02:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, you got me. I find that funny.
[2015/11/12 14:02:21] <brmbrmcar> Only because of a few idiots who started a war.
[2015/11/12 14:02:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Hitler parodies are something different.
[2015/11/12 14:02:44] <Karkus> Tobbi: You've seen it already then? :P
[2015/11/12 14:02:52] <Tobbi> Karkus:  yeah ! :D

[2015/11/12 14:13:23] <Karkus> It's super easy to learn, takes a couple months to become fluent in it. (I've heard)
[2015/11/12 14:13:32] <Karkus> Very similar to Latin
[2015/11/12 14:13:46] <Tobbi> Karkus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aTu-TX3img

[2015/11/12 14:16:16] <brmbrmcar> I want to be fluent at German.
[2015/11/12 14:16:21] <Karkus> leyyin: I guess that not many people are hipsters then.
[2015/11/12 14:17:16] <brmbrmcar> Doews any one speak brmbrmcar?
[2015/11/12 14:17:49] <Tobbi> leyyin: Nerds learn Klingon.
[2015/11/12 14:18:38] <brmbrmcar> brmbrmcar language is like Linux. You get distrobutions of all major languages.
[2015/11/12 14:20:42] <brmbrmcar> Who wants to learn?
[2015/11/12 14:20:54] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: No thanks

[2015/11/12 17:25:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: But it's a religious song?
[2015/11/12 17:25:40] <Tobbi> or not?
[2015/11/12 17:26:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's one of the few songs I really like.
[2015/11/12 17:27:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not really my style... but part of our christmas playlist this year. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeaHAQklVVc&list=PLzGCPH8UWJzInF-XeNlDUZGvFjr0SWobt&index=3

[2015/11/12 19:01:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about you take over... :P Make language add-ons work after I tried unsuccessfully.
[2015/11/12 19:03:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did we actually ever decide on a proper release date?
[2015/11/12 19:09:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im thinking the day before christmas...
[2015/11/12 19:09:15] <head8debian> If thats possible.
[2015/11/12 19:09:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: But then people won't have that much time to see the new x-mas stuff.
[2015/11/12 19:09:31] <Tobbi> Actually, let me have a look.
[2015/11/12 19:10:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: True...
[2015/11/12 19:10:49] <head8debian> Tobbi: How about the 20th?
[2015/11/12 19:10:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: That could work.
[2015/11/12 19:11:00] <Tobbi> But, let's see...
[2015/11/12 19:11:37] <head8debian> Im afk. :)
[2015/11/12 19:12:21] <Tobbi> head8debian: SuperTux 0.3.1 was released on the 20th.
[2015/11/12 19:12:25] <Tobbi> So, maybe we should do that.
[2015/11/12 19:13:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Does this computer even look worth $45? http://www.asus.com/Notebooks/Eee_PC_1001PX_Seashell/
[2015/11/12 19:13:30] <head8debian> Used. 2gb ram.
[2015/11/12 19:14:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: I have no idea.
[2015/11/12 19:15:25] <head8debian> Hmm... A local school is gettign rid of a bunch of them.
[2015/11/12 19:29:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: But Windows 10 is such a hog that i don't think they would fare well on them.
[2015/11/12 19:29:39] <Tobbi> heh
[2015/11/12 19:30:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Google chrome is a hog as of recently also...
[2015/11/12 19:31:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: I see.
[2015/11/12 19:33:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: You haven't noticed? :)
[2015/11/12 19:33:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't use google chrome as much.
[2015/11/12 19:34:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot open more than 10 tabs now in chrome without filling up my ram and causing swap to kick in.
[2015/11/12 19:36:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Am i boring you?
[2015/11/12 19:36:17] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do you want me to be honest?
[2015/11/12 19:38:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes!
[2015/11/12 19:38:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Actually, as much as you write, you could become a wikipedia editor.
[2015/11/12 19:39:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: I've considered it. :-) If i got paid i might consider it.
[2015/11/12 19:39:33] <head8debian> further*
[2015/11/12 19:39:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why would you want to get paid?
[2015/11/12 19:40:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Wikipedia is a voluntary site. No one earns anything.
[2015/11/12 19:40:07] <Tobbi> Except Jimmy Wales.
[2015/11/12 19:40:10] <head8debian> I know. :-) It was a joke.
[2015/11/12 19:40:33] <head8debian> But for as much as we both type we could have huge websites with tons of info...
[2015/11/12 19:40:43] <head8debian> And this is the best ive gotten... :p

[2015/11/12 19:46:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't think i will buy any of those computers...
[2015/11/12 19:46:27] <head8debian> I honestly don't feel right trying to resell anything with less than 4gb of ram.
[2015/11/12 19:46:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Good thinking. I would suggest a Rechenschiebevorrichtung.
[2015/11/12 19:47:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Huh?
[2015/11/12 19:47:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: calculation shifting appliance.
[2015/11/12 19:47:34] <head8debian> _O

[2015/11/12 19:49:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: LOL. Sorry. :-) Or is he becoming like me? :)
[2015/11/12 19:49:50] <Tobbi> head8debian: Or you two are the same person?

[2015/11/12 19:51:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Definately not.
[2015/11/12 19:51:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: good.
[2015/11/12 19:51:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: I should work on our wiki...
[2015/11/12 19:52:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, you should work on language add-on support.
[2015/11/12 19:52:19] <Tobbi> For some reason it won't work properly unless you restart...
[2015/11/12 19:52:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot code. We have been over this.
[2015/11/12 19:52:29] <head8debian> Uhm, at least it work?
[2015/11/12 19:52:31] <head8debian> works*
[2015/11/12 19:52:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yeah, it works...
[2015/11/12 19:52:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: You should really learn how to code.
[2015/11/12 19:54:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: I will learn a little when my Arduino gets here.
[2015/11/12 19:54:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, at least that's Python. Is it on its way?
[2015/11/12 19:54:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot even motivate myself to learn to program, how can i motivate myself to learn to code?
[2015/11/12 19:54:24] <Tobbi> Wait, is it python?
[2015/11/12 19:54:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Aren't those two things the same thing?
[2015/11/12 19:54:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: No. Its a hack up of C and C++
[2015/11/12 19:54:43] <Tobbi> Even better!
[2015/11/12 19:54:46] <head8debian> program a website**
[2015/11/12 19:55:02] <head8debian> Except my arduino was supposed to be here last week...
[2015/11/12 19:55:08] <head8debian> And still hasn't appeared.
[2015/11/12 19:55:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do you hate giving presentations as much as I do?
[2015/11/12 19:55:33] <head8debian> When i give one i will let you know. :-)
[2015/11/12 19:55:54] <Tobbi> heh...
[2015/11/12 19:56:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im getting more comfortable with speaking in front of people...
[2015/11/12 19:56:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: Well, actually it was worse when I was younger.
[2015/11/12 19:56:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: I speek in front of kids at church all the time, so how much harder can can grown ups be? :D
[2015/11/12 19:57:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: Kids are easier to integrate into a dishwasher than grownups. So there's that.
[2015/11/12 19:57:43] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/12 19:58:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: Have you ever tried to integrate kids into a dishwasher?
[2015/11/12 20:00:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: No.
[2015/11/12 20:00:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: Do you have some Cat5 that i can have?
[2015/11/12 20:00:43] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, I wouldn't be able to care about a cat.
[2015/11/12 20:00:44] <head8debian> I need a short piece.

[2015/11/13 08:39:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: Your IRC client did some smamming yesterday...
[2015/11/13 08:39:39] <head8debian> spamming*
[2015/11/13 08:39:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Really?
[2015/11/13 08:39:46] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/13 08:39:55] <leyyin> Tobbi, you should kick yourself
[2015/11/13 08:40:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't see it in the logs...
[2015/11/13 08:40:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: You left here thankfully.
[2015/11/13 08:40:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: try the #stk logs.
[2015/11/13 08:40:32] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/13 08:41:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: It was even more excessive in #secretchronicles... so i put a temporary ban on you in there.
[2015/11/13 08:41:07] <head8debian> Must have had internet issues.
[2015/11/13 08:41:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yeah, I should probably use a bouncer...
[2015/11/13 08:41:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: Why?
[2015/11/13 08:42:24] <Tobbi> I thought I had shutdown my computer.
[2015/11/13 08:42:47] <Tobbi> Well..
[2015/11/13 08:47:27] <Tobbi> head8debian: SuperTux 0.3.5a is now in homebrew-games
[2015/11/13 08:48:18] <leyyin> who uses mac anyways :P
[2015/11/13 08:48:34] <Tobbi> leyyin: Who uses Chromebooks, anyways? :P
[2015/11/13 08:48:42] <leyyin> not me ;)
[2015/11/13 08:48:57] <leyyin> I did not use one for almost 2 months
[2015/11/13 08:48:57] <Tobbi> leyyin: Maybe if I knew anything about computers, I would probably buy a different one.
[2015/11/13 08:53:57] <Tobbi> Okay, that is getting old, I have to admit.
[2015/11/13 08:55:09] * head8debian nods...
[2015/11/13 08:55:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: You don't need to buy a diferent one, you need to install Arch on your current one. :D
[2015/11/13 08:55:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: I'd rather not.
[2015/11/13 08:57:52] <leyyin> head8debian, everyone knows that arch is for peasants and gentoo is for gods ;)
[2015/11/13 08:58:42] <head8debian> Ok, debian? :D
[2015/11/13 08:58:53] <leyyin> debian is for plebs :P
[2015/11/13 08:59:04] <head8debian> Tobbi + ubuntu. Fits perfect. :p
[2015/11/13 08:59:11] <Tobbi> I tried ubuntu.
[2015/11/13 08:59:18] <head8debian> leyyin + gentoo, fits perfect.
[2015/11/13 08:59:18] <Tobbi> Didn't like it.
[2015/11/13 08:59:30] <head8debian> head8debian + gentoo. Pushing it too far.
[2015/11/13 08:59:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't blame you.
[2015/11/13 09:00:11] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its a broken OS IMHO.
[2015/11/13 09:09:32] <leyyin> os means bone in Romanian :P
[2015/11/13 09:09:41] <leyyin> get another os Tobbi
[2015/11/13 09:09:43] <leyyin> good boy
[2015/11/13 09:09:53] <Tobbi> leyyin: os is bone in Latin as well.
[2015/11/13 09:10:05] <leyyin> well yeah, we are latin people ;)

[2015/11/13 09:11:17] <Tobbi> haha.
[2015/11/13 09:11:18] <Tobbi> Sorry.
[2015/11/13 09:11:54] <leyyin> well at least you know your language group, right?
[2015/11/13 09:12:41] <Tobbi> leyyin: Germanic? :P

[2015/11/13 09:14:35] <Tobbi> Despite me not knowing anything.
[2015/11/13 09:14:39] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/13 09:14:42] <Tobbi> maths22: Thanks.
[2015/11/13 09:14:47] <maths22> Also, I haven't yet integrated your recent changes into my branch, hence the wrong version number
[2015/11/13 09:15:02] <maths22> (It hasn't been rebuilt recently)
[2015/11/13 09:15:11] <Tobbi> Right!
[2015/11/13 09:15:14] <Tobbi> No problem.
[2015/11/13 09:15:46] <Tobbi> leyyin: I got a task for you: Find out why language packs only work properly after a restart...
[2015/11/13 09:16:02] <Tobbi> for SuperTux that is.
[2015/11/13 09:16:39] <leyyin> busy for STK :P
[2015/11/13 09:16:44] <leyyin> hiker is gonna kill me
[2015/11/13 09:16:56] <leyyin> Tobbi, what is your threat?
[2015/11/13 09:17:13] <Tobbi> leyyin: I can kill you as well? As you know, I got a chainsaw.
[2015/11/13 09:17:20] <Tobbi> Actually, make that two.
[2015/11/13 09:17:24] <leyyin> hiker has connections ;)
[2015/11/13 09:18:00] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/11/13 09:35:43] <maths22> By the way, what Linux distros should we be building for?
[2015/11/13 09:35:50] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/13 09:39:45] <Tobbi> hmm. let me check.
[2015/11/13 09:43:21] <head8debian> Uhm, every OS we can? :D
[2015/11/13 09:43:35] <head8debian> distro*
[2015/11/13 09:44:40] <maths22> Setting up each one takes a non-zero amount of effort
[2015/11/13 09:45:18] <maths22> Therefore, I want to figure out which ones we want so I can focus that effort on the more important distros/versions first
[2015/11/13 09:46:31] <head8debian> maths22: Good idea.
[2015/11/13 09:49:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: What do you think?
[2015/11/13 09:49:47] <Tobbi> think?
[2015/11/13 09:49:52] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/11/13 09:50:09] <Tobbi> I mean: Target most popular distros and be good with it.
[2015/11/13 09:50:45] <maths22> You can see which ones are currently working here: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:maths22:SuperTux/supertux2
[2015/11/13 09:54:33] <Tobbi> maths22: So, target those that work. The other ones, well, if you can, compile the missing deps yourself on those distros and use that.

[2015/11/13 10:55:45] <leyyin> maybe someone else is using your computer
[2015/11/13 10:56:03] <brmbrmcar> Like your goats.

[2015/11/13 10:58:04] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: I don't think my goats have wifi way over there, or can type so well.
[2015/11/13 10:59:56] <brmbrmcar> They use superfast Goat internet.
[2015/11/13 11:00:03] <brmbrmcar> Faster than 5g.
[2015/11/13 11:00:24] <brmbrmcar> And can type at over 400 WPM.
[2015/11/13 11:00:41] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/13 11:02:29] <mt> maths22: well I'd suggest to get the build working on opensuse 13.2 and ubuntu 15.10 (what's the problem with the latter - libsdl2-*dev exists in the official package archives for wily and even xenial)
[2015/11/13 11:03:10] <mt> possibly also centos 7, but I'm not sure anybody's using that on a desktop system
[2015/11/13 11:03:16] <brmbrmcar> Goat internet costs 9999000$ a month.
[2015/11/13 11:05:08] <head8debian> Nobody i know is using centOS as a desktop OS.
[2015/11/13 11:05:20] <mt> if you need an Arch Linux PKGBUILD I can provide you one
[2015/11/13 11:05:25] <brmbrmcar> What is centOS?
[2015/11/13 11:05:32] <head8debian> maths22: Not opensuse 43 or whatever the latest release is?
[2015/11/13 11:05:37] <head8debian> mt: ^^
[2015/11/13 11:05:51] <head8debian> I can also provide one.
[2015/11/13 11:07:04] <mt> brmbrmcar: it's CentOS and it's a binary-compatible rebuild of the RedHat Enterprise Linux sources without proprietary RedHat logos etc.
[2015/11/13 11:08:52] <mt> head8debian: openSUSE Tumbleweed is the latest release for the build service, I'm unsure what this OS 42/43/whatever is supposed to be

[2015/11/13 11:56:07] <mt> Also, I'd sugggest you to use such a dynamic versioning using git commit number since first commit and git commit hash for the other packages
[2015/11/13 11:56:25] <mt> Since OBS provides a usable repository for package manager
[2015/11/13 11:56:27] <mt> s
[2015/11/13 11:57:34] <maths22> mt: I will fix the version numbers
[2015/11/13 11:57:42] <maths22> They will end up like git describe ones
[2015/11/13 11:57:57] <maths22> (latest tag + hash)
[2015/11/13 12:00:24] <mt> Yeah but be careful with the PKGBUILD because that won't really work (0.4.0.ae4ab9b will be considered a lower version than 0.4.0.bb0e3e1 in pacman)
[2015/11/13 12:00:50] <mt> I don't know how other systems will handle that
[2015/11/13 12:01:38] <maths22> this is why it is actually latest tag + num commits + hash
[2015/11/13 12:01:55] <maths22> i.e 1.0.4-14-g2414721
[2015/11/13 12:02:00] <mt> why do you write tag + hash then
[2015/11/13 12:02:11] <maths22> Because I wasn't thinking
[2015/11/13 12:02:47] <mt> and if you're already saying 1.0.4-14-g24...: pacman doesn't allow dashes in pkgver
[2015/11/13 12:04:31] <brmbrmcar> Nome of the buil;ds work for me.

[2015/11/13 12:11:54] <mt> Tobbi: is that even allowed under GPL/CC-BY-SA? Aren't you only allowed to charge the cost of distribution (which I'd say for savannah is none)?

[2015/11/13 12:12:25] <Tobbi> That's a good question. I thought it was...

[2015/11/13 12:12:37] <Tobbi> SA...share alike.
[2015/11/13 12:12:50] <Tobbi> Question is GPL
[2015/11/13 12:13:03] <Tobbi> I don't know.
[2015/11/13 12:13:45] <mt> well as seen in the picture it uses our images
[2015/11/13 12:14:21] <mt> so, ask a lawyer and then submit a DMCA takedown notice?

[2015/11/13 12:16:38] <head8debian> sue, sue!
[2015/11/13 12:16:39] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/13 12:16:42] <maths22> Since these are art assets, and not code, the application of the GPL to them is less than obvious
[2015/11/13 12:16:48] <maths22> Thus, a good question for a lawyer
[2015/11/13 12:16:58] <head8debian> Sew Sew... :p

[2015/11/13 12:18:10] <Tobbi> mt: The image are share-alike. So if he shares only those (allows them to be downloaded)...
[2015/11/13 12:18:32] <Tobbi> right?
[2015/11/13 12:18:50] <Tobbi> I don't really want to pay for a lawyer :D not for this project.
[2015/11/13 12:19:15] <mt> I think EFF or some other open source organization provides lawyers for projects
[2015/11/13 12:19:26] <maths22> Due to the fact that images are not code, not linked in code, etc, sharing the assets probably is enough for him
[2015/11/13 12:20:49] <Tobbi> I hope he attributes us...

[2015/11/13 12:22:04] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/13 12:22:21] <Tobbi> Okay, I rather meant in-game as well.
[2015/11/13 12:22:42] <maths22> I believe it owuld simply need to be in the game distribution
[2015/11/13 12:22:58] <maths22> That is, in some LICENCE/LEGAL/CREDITS file distributed with the game
[2015/11/13 12:23:12] <Tobbi> Unfortunately we cannot check.
[2015/11/13 12:23:23] <Tobbi> Since there are no binary distributions available,
[2015/11/13 12:24:20] <maths22> If there is no binary distribution, then it is hard to violate the terms associated with a binary distrubtion
[2015/11/13 12:24:23] <Tobbi> Are any of the items under a CC-NC license?
[2015/11/13 12:25:06] <maths22> (That is, he can't be doing something wrong with a thing that he is has not created/shared)
[2015/11/13 12:25:43] <maths22> everything appears to be GPL or CC-BY-SA
[2015/11/13 12:26:06] <mt> Well, the art *has* to be attributed in any case, be it in the code or in a binary distribution

[2015/11/13 12:41:22] <Tobbi> Not sure.
[2015/11/13 12:42:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: I can give you a bouncer if you would really like.
[2015/11/13 12:42:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: I'd rather go for a proper one...
[2015/11/13 12:42:29] <Tobbi> Or I host it on my raspberry pi.
[2015/11/13 12:42:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/13 12:42:44] <head8debian> It is propper.
[2015/11/13 12:43:34] <Karkus> Regarding that freegamedev post, what if he's using the code from supertux too?
[2015/11/13 12:43:40] <Karkus> How could we ever know?
[2015/11/13 12:43:55] <Tobbi> We can't.
[2015/11/13 12:44:23] <Tobbi> That's actually a problem.
[2015/11/13 12:44:38] <Karkus> With the GPL in general
[2015/11/13 12:44:50] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/13 12:44:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: http://retux.nongnu.org/index.html this uses SuperTux images
[2015/11/13 12:44:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: I wonder if brmbrmcar is spying on us through the logs... they will refresh in 3 mins...

[2015/11/13 12:45:01] <Karkus> Speak of the devil
[2015/11/13 12:45:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: He PMed me and asked me why I kicked him.
[2015/11/13 12:45:07] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/13 12:45:13] <Tobbi> He told me his message wasn't coming through.
[2015/11/13 12:45:29] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Don't Ping people repeadedly.
[2015/11/13 12:45:30] <Tobbi> Not sure if his client was acting up or whether he was just getting on our nerves.
[2015/11/13 12:45:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: I think latter... my client never acts up...
[2015/11/13 12:45:50] <Tobbi> I still assume it's the latter but we can never know.
[2015/11/13 12:45:52] <Tobbi> hah
[2015/11/13 12:46:02] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: If there appears to be a problem, try reconnecting rather than resending the message
[2015/11/13 12:46:06] <head8debian> Ive never have had one act up either.
[2015/11/13 12:46:17] <brmbrmcar> I didn't know I sent it.
[2015/11/13 12:46:32] <brmbrmcar> After a while I just restarted.
[2015/11/13 12:46:35] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: mt told you to stop, what else could he have been referring to?
[2015/11/13 12:46:45] <brmbrmcar> I didn't see it.
[2015/11/13 12:46:53] <Karkus> head8debian: My experience with bad internet tells me that sometimes I send a message and see it in the client but it hasn't sent.
[2015/11/13 12:47:00] <Karkus> This could be the other way rounf
[2015/11/13 12:47:24] <maths22> I'm guessing the client stopped showing new messages
[2015/11/13 12:47:34] <maths22> Including those he sent
[2015/11/13 12:47:37] <Karkus> maths22: I'm guessing that too
[2015/11/13 12:48:00] <head8debian> Karkus: irssi tells me if its having trouble connecting to the server.
[2015/11/13 12:48:17] <Karkus> head8debian: After how long?
[2015/11/13 12:48:40] <Karkus> Hexchat takes a while to notice
[2015/11/13 12:49:15] <head8debian> Karkus: Usually a few seconds. Then it tells you when the last time it was able to contact the server.
[2015/11/13 12:49:24] <maths22> It sounds like a bug, not a network error
[2015/11/13 12:49:34] <brmbrmcar> The [#supertux] disappeared.
[2015/11/13 12:49:41] <Karkus> It doesn't matter what caused it.
[2015/11/13 12:49:44] <maths22> Given that he had to restart to fix it
[2015/11/13 12:49:54] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: What IRC client do you use now?
[2015/11/13 12:50:37] <brmbrmcar> irssi
[2015/11/13 12:51:19] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/13 12:51:41] <Karkus> HexChat is better :P
[2015/11/13 12:51:56] <head8debian> Karkus: :-)
[2015/11/13 12:52:03] <head8debian> User glitch... :p
[2015/11/13 12:52:17] <Karkus> head8debian: ?
[2015/11/13 12:52:42] <maths22> Irssi is certainly better-you can leave it running on a server 24/7
[2015/11/13 12:53:02] <maths22> I can't do that with hexchat
[2015/11/13 12:53:08] <Karkus> maths22: Why would you?
[2015/11/13 12:53:11] <Karkus> It's a gui
[2015/11/13 12:53:11] <brmbrmcar> And anyway, when I say the word "test", surely you must mean something has happened?
[2015/11/13 12:53:36] <maths22> I wouldn't
[2015/11/13 12:53:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: Not sure if you can help it, but: Would you know/be able to find out how to make tinygettext effectively re-read the dictionaries (currently, language add-ons still don't work properly until you restart)
[2015/11/13 12:54:15] <maths22> My point was that irssi is clearly superior because it is cli- based /s
[2015/11/13 12:54:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'll have a look. Doubt I'll be of any help D:
[2015/11/13 12:54:38] <Tobbi> No problem.
[2015/11/13 12:55:14] <Karkus> maths22: Superior for some things, but sometimes you just want a pretty GUI
[2015/11/13 12:55:16] <head8debian> Karkus: Irssi is running on a headless server for me.
[2015/11/13 12:55:29] <head8debian> The last couple days the server hasn't had the best uptime. :p
[2015/11/13 12:55:30] <Karkus> head8debian: Which is a good way to use it
[2015/11/13 12:55:42] <mt> weechat <3
[2015/11/13 12:55:43] <head8debian> Yes, thats why im "always" in IRC.
[2015/11/13 12:55:51] <mt> also command line + support for IRCv3
[2015/11/13 12:55:53] <Karkus> head8debian: I figured
[2015/11/13 12:56:29] <Karkus> head8debian: I did try irssi but I didn't like it, just my opinion :) Not the kind of thing I needed
[2015/11/13 12:56:30] <brmbrmcar> irssijust looks awesome
[2015/11/13 12:56:55] <maths22> I actually have irssi set up as a proxy too, so I can use native irc clients (on my phone) in the same session
[2015/11/13 12:56:58] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: No, it looks like it's cli based
[2015/11/13 12:57:32] <head8debian> maths22: I don't really care. Irssi does the job well, and according to you is not "broken".
[2015/11/13 12:57:53] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: What?
[2015/11/13 12:57:56] <head8debian> maths22: I just ssh into my server.
[2015/11/13 12:58:03] <head8debian> From my phone. :)

[2015/11/13 12:58:16] <maths22> Some days I do
[2015/11/13 12:58:16] <Karkus> Command Line... Interface?
[2015/11/13 12:58:19] <head8debian> I don't like phone IRC though.
[2015/11/13 12:58:29] * head8debian laughs...
[2015/11/13 12:58:55] <maths22> I mostly got tired of losing spell check and swype
[2015/11/13 12:58:56] <head8debian> Now we are sharing screenshots? :p
[2015/11/13 12:59:06] <head8debian> maths22: Ah.
[2015/11/13 12:59:39] <head8debian> Irssi + guake = awesome. :D
[2015/11/13 12:59:52] <maths22> mt: which os?
[2015/11/13 12:59:56] <head8debian> I have my irc client at the cue of a couple hotkeys.
[2015/11/13 13:00:11] <brmbrmcar> How did you get it lokoing like that?
[2015/11/13 13:00:17] <head8debian> That reminds me, i should change my desktop background.
[2015/11/13 13:00:28] <head8debian> Look like he has a 4k screen or something...
[2015/11/13 13:00:31] <mt> Arch Linux, bspwm, GTK and QT with the Arc theme + breeze icons
[2015/11/13 13:00:50] <mt> Terminal is gnome-terminal but I'm also using xfce4-terminal
[2015/11/13 13:01:17] <mt> tmux for as terminal multiplexer, weechat for IRC
[2015/11/13 13:01:57] <mt> and no 4K, it's a full HD 27" display
[2015/11/13 13:02:11] <head8debian> Oh, 2k then. :)
[2015/11/13 13:02:25] <head8debian> Yeah... thats huge.
[2015/11/13 13:02:29] <brmbrmcar> 32K
[2015/11/13 13:02:42] <brmbrmcar> 4K is horrible!
[2015/11/13 13:03:05] <brmbrmcar> 4K is just giant blocks of colour!
[2015/11/13 13:03:14] <head8debian> maths22: Why bspwm?
[2015/11/13 13:03:27] <head8debian> maths22: Arg. Sorry.
[2015/11/13 13:03:33] <head8debian> mt: Why bspwm?
[2015/11/13 13:03:53] <mt> because it like its configuration; it supports gaps etc.
[2015/11/13 13:04:05] <head8debian> Ah.

[2015/11/13 14:37:34] <mt> why not?
[2015/11/13 14:38:30] <brmbrmcar> Because it would be chaos.
[2015/11/13 14:39:09] <brmbrmcar> It is a game-wide thing.
[2015/11/13 14:40:26] <datahead8888> Does Super Tux only use one collision box/circle to detect both enemy hits and if Tux is standing on the ground, or does it use a second collision detection and/or line casting?  If it only uses one collision, how does it tell if he collided on top of an object?
[2015/11/13 14:45:09] <datahead8888> I needed to clean up my collision detection in another game and was curious about this in Super Tux, since Math Nerd referenced it when I asked him.
[2015/11/13 14:49:58] <Karkus> datahead8888: I don't understand your question, what's wrong with one collision box?
[2015/11/13 14:54:05] <datahead8888> I never said anything was wrong with it :)
[2015/11/13 14:54:11] <datahead8888> I just asked how Super Tux does it.
[2015/11/13 14:54:59] <datahead8888> In my own game, I have one circle collider plus, essentially, four smaller circle colliders on top, bottom, left, and right.  It is a mess, I think.
[2015/11/13 14:55:02] <Karkus> datahead8888: Then I don't understand your question :P
[2015/11/13 14:55:35] <brmbrmcar> Collision!
[2015/11/13 14:55:55] <datahead8888> Does Super Tux detect both Super Tux running into enemies and standing on the ground using only one collision box?  Is more than one collision box used?  Does it also use line casting for part of this?
[2015/11/13 14:56:20] <brmbrmcar> I have no idea.
[2015/11/13 14:56:28] <brmbrmcar> I think just the one.
[2015/11/13 14:56:41] <datahead8888> Okay, I got that impression from what Math Nerd said
[2015/11/13 14:57:09] <datahead8888> I'd be curious to know how it tells if Tux is standing on top of a collided object or is to the side, though
[2015/11/13 14:57:37] <Karkus> datahead8888: All I know is, we use collision boxes, and we have problems sometimes
[2015/11/13 14:57:52] <datahead8888> Yes, especially with slopes I've heard
[2015/11/13 14:57:53] <Karkus> datahead8888: Boxes are different
[2015/11/13 14:58:04] <Karkus> datahead8888: Correct
[2015/11/13 14:58:24] <brmbrmcar> I don't know, maybe with decimals and gradient stuff to tell it which side of box.
[2015/11/13 14:58:42] <datahead8888> Gradients?
[2015/11/13 14:58:50] <brmbrmcar> Yeah
[2015/11/13 14:59:08] <datahead8888> Some people have suggested I add line casting to a collision box in my game; is this what you mean?
[2015/11/13 14:59:30] <brmbrmcar> Idon't know.
[2015/11/13 14:59:40] <brmbrmcar> What is your game?
[2015/11/13 15:01:09] <datahead8888> It is a Unity 2D platformer/shooter
[2015/11/13 15:01:21] <datahead8888> I was just curious how Super Tux handled things for reference
[2015/11/13 15:02:05] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/13 15:02:21] <brmbrmcar> Ino nothing about collision based stuff.
[2015/11/13 15:02:38] <leyyin> maths22, `sudo: required` is the opposite of `sudo: false` ?
[2015/11/13 15:03:57] <maths22> leyyin: nope
[2015/11/13 15:04:07] <maths22> The opposite is just not including `sudo: false`
[2015/11/13 15:04:27] <leyyin> the opposite as sudo:falses always run on containters
[2015/11/13 15:04:35] <leyyin> sudo:required never run on containers
[2015/11/13 15:04:53] <leyyin> so they seem to be ;)
[2015/11/13 15:05:07] <maths22> What is wrong wtih containers if you don't need sudo?
[2015/11/13 15:05:29] <leyyin> I do not know
[2015/11/13 15:05:53] <maths22> Were you just asking for your curiosity?
[2015/11/13 15:06:17] <brmbrmcar> Run this command but allow it to do anything it wants to this computer!
[2015/11/13 15:06:17] <leyyin> well yes
[2015/11/13 15:06:26] <leyyin> I am testing something out for the stk-editor
[2015/11/13 15:06:43] <brmbrmcar> The stk-editor doesn't work!
[2015/11/13 15:06:59] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, how so?
[2015/11/13 15:07:05] <leyyin> open issue
[2015/11/13 15:07:41] <brmbrmcar> I selected the directory with the files in and nothing happened!
[2015/11/13 15:08:03] <leyyin> did you read the manual :D
[2015/11/13 15:08:03] <leyyin> ?
[2015/11/13 15:08:16] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/13 15:08:28] <brmbrmcar> And the first step failed!
[2015/11/13 15:08:46] <brmbrmcar> Does it neeed to be 0.9.x?
[2015/11/13 15:08:54] <Karkus> datahead8888: A Unity game is a bit difficult to compare to SuperTux
[2015/11/13 15:09:01] <leyyin> I will have to check it out later
[2015/11/13 15:09:12] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/13 15:09:53] <datahead8888> Karkus, yes, but some principles do not change
[2015/11/13 15:10:56] <brmbrmcar> sudo apt-get install unity
[2015/11/13 15:11:55] <maths22> brmbrmcar: glad to know you appreciate the Ubuntu desktop interface
[2015/11/13 15:12:14] <maths22> (That is what that command would actually install on an Ubuntu machine)
[2015/11/13 15:12:54] <brmbrmcar> I don't like the tracking.
[2015/11/13 15:13:23] <brmbrmcar> And all the social media stuff.
[2015/11/13 15:13:44] <leyyin> maths22, also, is there no cleaner way to install mac packages? checking with an if "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" = "osx" is ugly :D
[2015/11/13 15:13:51] <leyyin> in before_install
[2015/11/13 15:14:13] <maths22> leyyin: at this point in time, no
[2015/11/13 15:14:26] <maths22> Hopefully, travis adds support like they have for apt as a plugin
[2015/11/13 15:14:31] <leyyin> yes :D
[2015/11/13 15:14:33] <leyyin> brew:
[2015/11/13 15:14:34] <leyyin> like apt
[2015/11/13 15:14:43] <maths22> That would be nice
[2015/11/13 15:14:57] <maths22> That said, SuperTux previously had it as a manual apt-get command
[2015/11/13 15:15:03] <maths22> because the apt plugin is pretty new
[2015/11/13 15:15:17] <brmbrmcar> sudo apt-get install supertux
[2015/11/13 15:15:27] <brmbrmcar> apt-cache search supertux
[2015/11/13 15:16:24] <Karkus> datahead8888: Yeah, of course. If you do line collision for each line in the rect, then you'll get the side. Or there are other fun ways.
[2015/11/13 15:17:02] <brmbrmcar> Crash!
[2015/11/13 15:19:13] <datahead8888> brmbrmcar, crash?
[2015/11/13 15:19:39] <brmbrmcar> datahead888: CRASH!
[2015/11/13 15:19:43] <leyyin> the containers suck :D, only 2 threads, really
[2015/11/13 15:19:51] <brmbrmcar> FRontal! Side! Rear!
[2015/11/13 15:19:54] <maths22> By the way, with these automated builds, I'm thinking that we need to change the way we label dev builds
[2015/11/13 15:19:56] <brmbrmcar> Rollover!
[2015/11/13 15:20:29] <maths22> Basically, tools tend to mark dev builds as coming x amount after the previous release, not coming before the next one
[2015/11/13 15:20:30] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: What are you on about?
[2015/11/13 15:20:54] <brmbrmcar> Crashes!
[2015/11/13 15:21:03] <brmbrmcar> brm brm car crashes!
[2015/11/13 15:21:27] <maths22> Therefore, we are currently on v0.3.5-385-gf69dc07 (by Git's numbering)
[2015/11/13 15:22:34] <maths22> This also makes package numbering work
[2015/11/13 15:22:59] <maths22> Currently, using our labeling scheme, we are on 0.4.0-git-3ecf...
[2015/11/13 15:23:17] <maths22> That either is not well ordered or comes after 0.4.0, which is actually the final release
[2015/11/13 15:23:50] <datahead8888> I think someone likes cars
[2015/11/13 15:24:32] <maths22> datahead8888: I'm with you on that one
[2015/11/13 15:24:43] <brmbrmcar> brm brm cars!
[2015/11/13 15:25:36] <leyyin> the trusty machines are even slower :D
[2015/11/13 15:25:43] <datahead8888> brmbrmcar, you ought to make a car crashing gmae
[2015/11/13 15:25:44] <datahead8888> ***game
[2015/11/13 15:25:52] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/13 15:25:58] <datahead8888> Seriously
[2015/11/13 15:26:00] <datahead8888> :)
[2015/11/13 15:26:02] <brmbrmcar> With airbags.
[2015/11/13 15:26:11] <brmbrmcar> I will try...
[2015/11/13 15:26:18] <maths22> leyyin: building supertuxkart?
[2015/11/13 15:26:18] <datahead8888> You could get points for better crashes and set up safety devices in the car
[2015/11/13 15:26:30] <leyyin> maths22, no, the stk-editor
[2015/11/13 15:26:33] <datahead8888> Be sure to use a good physics engine
[2015/11/13 15:26:54] <brmbrmcar> It would have to be realistic.
[2015/11/13 15:27:04] <datahead8888> Yeah
[2015/11/13 15:27:05] <maths22> leyyin: how long is it taking?
[2015/11/13 15:27:15] <datahead8888> You could also send cars into compressors in your game
[2015/11/13 15:27:34] <datahead8888> Or drop them from airplanes
[2015/11/13 15:27:35] <leyyin> about 2 minutes on 12.04
[2015/11/13 15:27:40] <leyyin> about 4 on 14.04
[2015/11/13 15:28:48] <brmbrmcar> Front end damage cm = speed in kmh divided by overlap
[2015/11/13 15:29:27] <maths22> leyyin: still less long than I had to wait when setting up the supertux builds
[2015/11/13 15:29:44] <brmbrmcar> After 40cm half damage amounts per 40cm
[2015/11/13 15:29:49] <leyyin> on the old machines with 32 threads, under 1 minute
[2015/11/13 15:29:49] <maths22> And I think I made about 50 commits (and waited through at least 30 of them)
[2015/11/13 15:29:59] <maths22> leyyin: what machines?
[2015/11/13 15:30:10] <leyyin> the old infrastructure of travis
[2015/11/13 15:30:34] <leyyin> well I will squash the commits to be only one ;)
[2015/11/13 15:30:36] <maths22> leyyin: infrastructure they don't have anymore, or the non-container one?
[2015/11/13 15:30:43] <maths22> leyyin: I will do the same
[2015/11/13 15:30:50] <leyyin> the non-container one
[2015/11/13 15:30:51] <maths22> If git doesn't hate me too much
[2015/11/13 15:31:06] <maths22> leyyin: That's odd.  Those are supposed to have 1.5 cores each (I believe)
[2015/11/13 15:31:13] <maths22> 32 threads should not have run that well
[2015/11/13 15:31:31] <leyyin> well it does not run well for STK but for the editor :D
[2015/11/13 15:31:40] <leyyin> for STK it crashes gcc
[2015/11/13 15:31:43] <leyyin> out of memory
[2015/11/13 15:31:54] <maths22> on the old one or the new one?
[2015/11/13 15:31:56] <leyyin> with make -j 32
[2015/11/13 15:31:59] <leyyin> the old one
[2015/11/13 15:32:49] <maths22> leyyin: did it do that with a lower number of parallel jobs, or did it actually build
[2015/11/13 15:33:05] <maths22> Also, seee the table here: http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/
[2015/11/13 15:33:17] <leyyin> nproc tells me there are 32
[2015/11/13 15:34:06] <leyyin> for the editor it did build
[2015/11/13 15:34:33] <maths22> See http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/speeding-up-the-build/#Parallelizing-your-build-on-one-VM
[2015/11/13 15:34:39] <maths22> That is where I got the 1.5 number
[2015/11/13 15:34:46] <maths22> Maybe that is only the new infrastructure
[2015/11/13 15:39:37] <brmbrmcar> Side impact is harder!
[2015/11/13 15:42:26] <brmbrmcar> Weight to size ratio percent will change figures, but speed in kmh divided by 4.

[2015/11/13 16:14:34] <brmbrmcar> I reset .supertux2 and everything was fine.
[2015/11/13 16:14:58] <brmbrmcar> But it was the same version that was buggy before.

[2015/11/13 16:31:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could actually have something in the config which creates spritesheets from the files, couldn't we?

[2015/11/13 18:04:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe we're uploading po files to Transifex.
[2015/11/13 18:04:27] <Tobbi> Unfortunately I don't know the details.
[2015/11/13 18:04:31] <Tobbi> Ask giby when he gets back.
[2015/11/13 18:04:38] <Tobbi> or rather when he magically appears.
[2015/11/13 18:04:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, but are they all just added manually
[2015/11/13 18:05:06] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe currently they are.

[2015/11/14 14:25:08] <brmbrmcar> I checked status.github.com

[2015/11/14 14:31:56] <mt> so if https://github.com works something is wrong in your config
[2015/11/14 14:32:31] <brmbrmcar> git clone https://github.com/brmbrmcar/supertux.git
[2015/11/14 14:32:50] <mt> yeah

[2015/11/14 14:34:58] <mt> which file?
[2015/11/14 14:36:16] <mt> if you mean that: the size of a git repository is so much bigger than the actual content/source code because it keeps all history
[2015/11/14 14:36:41] <mt> it also downloads all history unless you specify a --depth
[2015/11/14 14:38:19] <brmbrmcar> It said everything was up to date when I pushed the changes.
[2015/11/14 14:38:38] @ bb010g joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/14 14:39:47] <mt> well obviously if you didn't push the squashed commit it won't know about that anymore after you deleted your local copy
[2015/11/14 14:40:15] <mt> now squash the commit, git push -f, and wait for the PR to get merged
[2015/11/14 14:40:48] <brmbrmcar> Oh no.

[2015/11/14 14:43:59] <brmbrmcar> case, please try git rebase (--continue | --abort | --skip)

[2015/11/14 14:44:04] <brmbrmcar> valuable there.
[2015/11/14 14:44:23] <mt> well, git rebase --abort
[2015/11/14 14:44:27] <mt> I'd suggest
[2015/11/14 14:44:49] <mt> then `git rebase -i HEAD~2`
[2015/11/14 14:44:50] <brmbrmcar> I did it.
[2015/11/14 14:45:02] <brmbrmcar> And the commits have gone again!
[2015/11/14 14:45:17] <mt> well, so you didn't rebase -i ... yet?
[2015/11/14 14:45:26] <mt> then git reset --hard ... again
[2015/11/14 14:45:34] <mt> then git rebase -i ...
[2015/11/14 14:46:05] <mt> and in the editor coming up, change the 'pick' in front of 'ce83bfc' to 'squash'
[2015/11/14 14:46:09] <mt> then save + close
[2015/11/14 14:46:42] <mt> in the new editor window, set a commit message for the squashed commit
[2015/11/14 14:46:46] <mt> save+close again
[2015/11/14 14:46:53] <mt> -> you're done

[2015/11/14 14:48:17] <brmbrmcar> I did all that, but it still says everything is up to date.

There is quite a social division, which results in extremist views emerging as people do not feel like they are part of the community.

[2015/11/14 16:29:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: Wasn't it the IS who planned that?
[2015/11/14 16:29:29] <Tobbi> So, they still originated from within france?
[2015/11/14 16:29:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah
[2015/11/14 16:29:36] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2015/11/14 16:29:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Probably
[2015/11/14 16:30:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe if something like that would've happened in Germany... we wouldn't be well prepared either.
[2015/11/14 16:31:02] <brmbrmcar> Scary!
[2015/11/14 16:31:39] <brmbrmcar> Bomb/bullet proof brm brm car
[2015/11/14 16:35:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: You know you got that email from that Google head hunter right? What happened then? I think Google is really cool :P
[2015/11/14 16:35:30] <Tobbi> Karkus: I told him that I'd be thrilled, and sent him my CV.
[2015/11/14 16:35:35] <Tobbi> He forwarded that to the European guys.
[2015/11/14 16:35:42] <Tobbi> He originally thought I was from the US.
[2015/11/14 16:35:51] <Tobbi> And apparently the European guys didn't have any openings for me.
[2015/11/14 16:36:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, right D:
[2015/11/14 16:36:00] <Tobbi> I wonder whether my CV was wrong.
[2015/11/14 16:36:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I listed all programming languages I know even remotely...
[2015/11/14 16:36:17] <Tobbi> Maybe that was wrong.
[2015/11/14 16:36:31] <Tobbi> But I was so excited and wanted to give a good impression...
[2015/11/14 16:36:33] <Tobbi> So, yeah.
[2015/11/14 16:37:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: Probably just bad timing...
[2015/11/14 16:37:14] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2015/11/14 16:37:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, some people I talked to told me to try again. I might.
[2015/11/14 16:37:49] <brmbrmcar> What about brmbrmcar programming language? You just type things in and nothing happens.
[2015/11/14 16:37:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: You should. What do you have to lose by sending off an email?
[2015/11/14 16:37:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's true.
[2015/11/14 16:38:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: But it's weird that "Google applies with you for a job" :D
[2015/11/14 16:38:28] <Tobbi> Normally, it's the other way round.
[2015/11/14 16:39:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: They want the best of the best, so they search everywhere
[2015/11/14 16:39:18] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2015/11/14 16:39:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: But if they didn't take me that means I am not the best of the best.
[2015/11/14 16:39:35] <Karkus> Depending on where I head in the future, I might try to apply there
[2015/11/14 16:39:43] <Tobbi> So, maybe it doesn't make sense to apply again.
[2015/11/14 16:39:49] <brmbrmcar> Google is wierd.
[2015/11/14 16:40:07] <brmbrmcar> Google is not monopoly.
[2015/11/14 16:40:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: They might not have been looking for many applicants then
[2015/11/14 16:40:22] <Tobbi> Probably not.
[2015/11/14 16:40:29] <Tobbi> Still, I am not sure if I want to work at Google.
[2015/11/14 16:40:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: As you said, the guy who headhunted you thought you were American
[2015/11/14 16:40:52] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/11/14 16:41:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why ever not?
[2015/11/14 16:41:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, if you strip all the benefits off Google, at the end of the day, it's still a job.
[2015/11/14 16:41:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: The benefits are potentially tempting for me.
[2015/11/14 16:41:52] <brmbrmcar> I want to compete with Google.
[2015/11/14 16:41:54] <Tobbi> So, I might get more inclined to take a job at Google without looking for possibly better suiting alternatives.
[2015/11/14 16:42:00] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Compete with yourself, first.
[2015/11/14 16:42:08] <Tobbi> *better-suited
[2015/11/14 16:42:25] <brmbrmcar> I want to make software for driverless brm brm cars!
[2015/11/14 16:42:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Google is a nice environment, supposedly
[2015/11/14 16:43:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's made that way to make you productive.
[2015/11/14 16:43:21] <Tobbi> I assume.
[2015/11/14 16:43:40] <Karkus> Yeah
[2015/11/14 16:43:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, of course I am looking for prestige in my life and want everyone to think I am something special. And that's why it's so tempting to apply again.
[2015/11/14 16:44:08] <Tobbi> And that's why I want to think twice before doing so. I know my weaknesses. And prestige and money are two of them.
[2015/11/14 16:44:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: You don't have to work somewhere special to be special. You have to do something special
[2015/11/14 16:44:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: Money and prestige...
[2015/11/14 16:44:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know. But what I really want is come to terms with myself.
[2015/11/14 16:45:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: The thing I find enticing about Google is the 20% time.
[2015/11/14 16:45:33] <Tobbi> 20% to work on your own projects?
[2015/11/14 16:45:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Also, Google love people who work on open source projects
[2015/11/14 16:45:46] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/11/14 16:45:47] <Tobbi> right
[2015/11/14 16:45:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: As long as it has something to do with Google
[2015/11/14 16:46:01] <brmbrmcar> And no Google's rubbish that causes high speed crashes

[2015/11/15 07:56:13] <Karkus> conflicting packages???
[2015/11/15 07:56:33] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/15 07:56:42] <brmbrmcar> I can't build 0.0.6.
[2015/11/15 07:56:52] <Karkus> What's conflicting?
[2015/11/15 07:56:53] <brmbrmcar> So I am using a .deb file.
[2015/11/15 07:57:08] <brmbrmcar> Supertux 0.0.6 and supertux-stable
[2015/11/15 08:00:45] <Karkus> No, I have no idea :(
[2015/11/15 08:02:45] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/15 08:03:08] <brmbrmcar> I amtrying to create a Console command for MNID_RESETLEVEL.
[2015/11/15 08:03:22] <brmbrmcar> But I have no idea how to.
[2015/11/15 08:04:43] <Karkus> You want a console command which resets the level?
[2015/11/15 08:05:07] <Karkus> brmbrmcar:^
[2015/11/15 08:05:17] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/15 08:05:35] <brmbrmcar> I want a console command for a lot of things.
[2015/11/15 08:07:09] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Make an issue with all the commands you want
[2015/11/15 08:07:14] <brmbrmcar> K.
[2015/11/15 08:07:24] <brmbrmcar> But I will implement themall.
[2015/11/15 08:08:02] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: If you make an issue, we will be able to see what's going on, and help you :)
[2015/11/15 08:09:04] <brmbrmcar> Where?
[2015/11/15 08:09:08] <brmbrmcar> OnGithub?
[2015/11/15 08:10:46] <Karkus> Yes please
[2015/11/15 08:11:23] <Karkus> brmbrmcar:^
[2015/11/15 08:11:36] <brmbrmcar> I am doing so now...

[2015/11/15 08:27:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: IPC with SuperTux might be difficult, though.
[2015/11/15 08:27:20] <Tobbi> IPC = Inter Process Communication.
[2015/11/15 08:27:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I didn't say it would be easy, or possible
[2015/11/15 08:27:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: ik
[2015/11/15 08:27:33] <Tobbi> It'd need a server that could run and get the commands.
[2015/11/15 08:27:42] <Tobbi> You know, run in the background.
[2015/11/15 08:27:54] <Tobbi> We could make that dependent on the developer switch.
[2015/11/15 08:28:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: So we would use sockets?

[2015/11/15 09:05:01] <Karkus> grumbel: My plans are to make it better than the current editor, and more portable

[2015/11/15 09:07:45] <Karkus> grumbel: Tobbi had issues getting the current editor to work on Mac OSX, and we need an editor which will stay updated as the game does

[2015/11/15 09:21:55] <grumbel> Karkus: looks fine so far
[2015/11/15 09:23:11] <Tobbi> I really wonder whether the latest glbinding would work with SuperTux.
[2015/11/15 09:23:55] <Karkus> grumbel: I've also thought about a plugin API
[2015/11/15 09:26:28] <Karkus> grumbel: And IPC so the editor can affect what happens more than just by passing arguments
[2015/11/15 09:27:22] <grumbel> sounds like overkill
[2015/11/15 09:28:53] <Karkus> grumbel: Why? I want a tux object for the player to move and then he spawns there
[2015/11/15 09:29:07] <Karkus> I want a lot of things :P
[2015/11/15 09:29:15] <grumbel> ./supertux levelname.stl --start-pos x,y
[2015/11/15 09:30:08] <grumbel> I'd prefer something simple that actually works, then some pie-in-the-sky thing that never gets finished and makes portability harder
[2015/11/15 09:30:33] <Karkus> grumbel: Yeah, I see what you mean
[2015/11/15 09:31:18] <grumbel> I would focus on basic stuff, i.e. add auto-smoothing to the tile painting
[2015/11/15 09:31:29] <Karkus> auto smoothing?
[2015/11/15 09:31:54] <grumbel> automatically painting the edge tiles so you don't have to do that manually
[2015/11/15 09:32:08] <grumbel> the C# has a function for that, but it's not that great there either
[2015/11/15 09:32:12] <Karkus> Oh, yeah I thought about that too :)
[2015/11/15 09:32:19] <Tobbi> I wonder how we'd go about doing that... It needs to be simple.
[2015/11/15 09:32:33] <Karkus> What about slopes?
[2015/11/15 09:33:17] <grumbel> Has anybody played with the SuperMarioMaker thing on WiiU?
[2015/11/15 09:33:27] <Karkus> grumbel: Yup :)
[2015/11/15 09:33:47] <Karkus> grumbel: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/103
[2015/11/15 09:34:28] <Karkus> That kind of gameplay could exist like the old 0.1.x editor
[2015/11/15 09:34:54] <Tobbi> I still think that supertux's UI isn't the best choice for this kind of advanced editor.
[2015/11/15 09:37:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's why I want to continue with Flexlay
[2015/11/15 09:37:14] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/11/15 09:37:28] <grumbel> Tobbi: it wouldn't need to be advanced, just something that lets people build levels easily
[2015/11/15 09:37:37] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/11/15 09:39:18] <Karkus> grumbel: Also, there are a few files (including everything in flexlay/wip, flexlay/[canvas, brush, brushmask].py etc.) which I don't understand the intended purpose of, and cannot find any information on what needs doing
[2015/11/15 09:39:21] <Tobbi> grumbel: By the way: After removing directories from tinygettext and rebuilding the cache, how would I go about refreshing the UI?
[2015/11/15 09:41:28] <grumbel> Karkus: Those are classes from the C++ code that haven't been ported over yet
[2015/11/15 09:41:45] <grumbel> Karkus: the Python editor is basically a 1:1 translation of the C++ code
[2015/11/15 09:44:38] <grumbel> Karkus: http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/flexlaypaint8.png
[2015/11/15 09:44:45] <Karkus> grumbel: Okay, I will look into that
[2015/11/15 09:44:52] <grumbel> flexlay used to have some drawing functionality
[2015/11/15 09:45:25] <grumbel> Canvas was the pixel buffer, brush and brushmask where the brushes you could draw into that pixel buffer
[2015/11/15 09:45:33] <Tobbi> I guess I will just display a message to please restart the game after installing language packs.
[2015/11/15 09:45:42] <grumbel> can be ignored for the moment, it's not really needed for supertux
[2015/11/15 09:46:50] <grumbel> something different: I cleaned up the lisp parser code and optimized it a bit: https://github.com/lispparser/sexp-cpp
[2015/11/15 09:47:21] <Tobbi> grumbel: Can you do a pull request against the SuperTux repo?
[2015/11/15 09:47:55] <Karkus> grumbel: Can I move the canvas files etc. into wip/ so they're out of the way?
[2015/11/15 09:48:06] <Karkus> Or onto a different branch?
[2015/11/15 09:48:54] <grumbel> Karkus: put them in wip/
[2015/11/15 09:49:31] <grumbel> Tobbi: will need some further work to integrate, I'll send a push request one day
[2015/11/15 09:49:39] <Tobbi> Thanks.
[2015/11/15 09:55:58] <grumbel> Tobbi: about refreshing the GUI with new translation, easiest would be to restart the main loop, i.e. the part in Main::launch_game()
[2015/11/15 09:56:12] <Tobbi> grumbel: But doing so from the UI?
[2015/11/15 09:56:40] <grumbel> Tobbi: maybe throw a TranslationUpdated exception or something like that?
[2015/11/15 09:56:53] <Tobbi> I could do that, actually.
[2015/11/15 09:56:55] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2015/11/15 10:00:32] <Tobbi> Actually, if I pop the screen, then push a new TitleScreen, this could work.
[2015/11/15 10:05:39] <Karkus> grumbel: Was the auto-smoothing a different tool?
[2015/11/15 10:06:25] <grumbel> Karkus: flexlay never really had auto-smoothing (other then some experimental script that never worked well)
[2015/11/15 10:06:40] <Karkus> grumbel: Well, what do you want then?
[2015/11/15 10:07:58] <grumbel> A tile tool that lets me select "snow" tiles and then paint them around while auto-smoothing the edges
[2015/11/15 10:08:58] <grumbel> The C# smoothing tool is a separate tool that you use to smooth out the tiles after you have painted them
[2015/11/15 10:09:27] <grumbel> It sort of works and could be ported over to Flexlay, but it's not quite as easy to use as I would like
[2015/11/15 10:09:54] <grumbel> The tricky part is that a lot of tilemaps in SuperTux aren't conceptually clean
[2015/11/15 10:10:00] <Tobbi> I was also thinking of a scenery creation tool that allows you to select different slopes and place them, and it'll automatically create a smooth scenery.
[2015/11/15 10:10:51] <grumbel> i.e. you might have tiles spread over different layers and such or special tiles that still look like other tiles
[2015/11/15 10:12:25] <grumbel> not sure how to deal with slopes, in flexlay/netpanzer-editor I had the ability to flatten/unflatten groups of tiles into objects
[2015/11/15 10:12:38] <grumbel> http://www.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/flexlay/images/netpanzer-1.jpg
[2015/11/15 10:12:39] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 272 seconds
[2015/11/15 10:12:56] <grumbel> that might work with slopes as well
[2015/11/15 10:13:39] <grumbel> are there any editors out there that deal with slopes well?
[2015/11/15 10:14:43] <grumbel> MarioMaker doesn't have slopes as far as I understand

[2015/11/15 10:22:34] <Tobbi> hrm, restarting the main loop doesn't want to work.
[2015/11/15 10:22:52] <Tobbi> I mean: Clearly it works, but it doesn't fix the problem.
[2015/11/15 10:23:10] <Tobbi> I tried clearing the menu stack which won't work either.
[2015/11/15 10:25:17] <grumbel> Tobbi: MenuManager needs to be recreated
[2015/11/15 10:25:30] <Tobbi> Alright...
[2015/11/15 10:25:43] <Tobbi> grumbel: Can't I do that without restarting the main loop?
[2015/11/15 10:26:23] <grumbel> MenuManager is part of ScreenManager
[2015/11/15 10:27:01] <grumbel> Maybe, but I don't now where all the strings are hiding

[2015/11/15 10:28:07] <grumbel> Recreating the ScreenManager should take care of the menu
[2015/11/15 10:28:23] <grumbel> not sure if there is any more hiding in AddonManager, Resources and all the rest
[2015/11/15 10:28:53] <grumbel> If in doubt, restart everything that isn't SDL init code

[2015/11/15 10:52:57] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/11/15 10:53:03] <Tobbi> Oh, I tried that. It didn't work.
[2015/11/15 10:53:11] <Tobbi> Not that I expected it to work.
[2015/11/15 10:53:11] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/15 10:53:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why wouldn't it work though?
[2015/11/15 10:53:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: It crashed for some reason...
[2015/11/15 10:55:24] <Tobbi> I give up for now.
[2015/11/15 10:56:07] <Tobbi> I even tried to restart the main loop which didn't work either.
[2015/11/15 10:57:40] <Karkus> Why do you need to refresh the menu?
[2015/11/15 10:58:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: Because otherwise it won't pick up new translations...
[2015/11/15 10:58:11] <Karkus> When you change language normally it works though...
[2015/11/15 10:58:19] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/11/15 10:58:22] <Tobbi> that's true...
[2015/11/15 10:58:26] <Tobbi> Let me check something.
[2015/11/15 10:58:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: It puts you back to the first (main) menu
[2015/11/15 10:59:01] <Tobbi> Yeah.
[2015/11/15 10:59:05] <Karkus> And everything's translated

[2015/11/15 12:07:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: You can't activate the switch in edit mode
[2015/11/15 12:07:51] <mt> head8debian: there's the official docs and #arduino
[2015/11/15 12:07:53] <Tobbi> Karkus: If you press Action, it returns...
[2015/11/15 12:07:55] <brmbrmcar> Press action.
[2015/11/15 12:08:00] <Tobbi> And then press the switch.
[2015/11/15 12:08:01] <Karkus> head8debian: I've got one, but I don't know a thing of how to use it :P
[2015/11/15 12:08:26] <brmbrmcar> Can you not read the infoblock?
[2015/11/15 12:08:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: I updated the testcase.
[2015/11/15 12:08:51] <Tobbi> Just activate the switch and it should crash.
[2015/11/15 12:11:41] <Tobbi> Actually...
[2015/11/15 12:12:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: How do I press the switch in edit mode?
[2015/11/15 12:12:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: Press action key (left ctrl key for me)
[2015/11/15 12:13:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah, okay
[2015/11/15 12:13:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, let me try in the console
[2015/11/15 12:13:57] <Tobbi> I believe that works.
[2015/11/15 12:14:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, it doesn't crash?
[2015/11/15 12:14:20] <Tobbi> I believe so.
[2015/11/15 12:14:31] <brmbrmcar> The console does not crash it.
[2015/11/15 12:14:59] <Karkus> What does the action key actually do while in edit mode?
[2015/11/15 12:15:15] <brmbrmcar> Let Tux move again.
[2015/11/15 12:17:49] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Turn edit mode off?
[2015/11/15 12:22:14] <Karkus> Okay, I believe I understand the issue now
[2015/11/15 12:24:09] <Tobbi> I am having trouble finding the cause of this.
[2015/11/15 12:28:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: I have no idea where to look :/
[2015/11/15 12:28:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe this might be some issue inside Squirrel...
[2015/11/15 12:29:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is Level.edit already set to false by pressing the action key?
[2015/11/15 12:29:08] <Tobbi> Probably?
[2015/11/15 12:29:26] <Tobbi> Actually, we could circumvent this, probably.
[2015/11/15 12:30:27] <Karkus> http://squirrel-lang.org/ works for me now
[2015/11/15 12:35:29] <Tobbi> I don't understand the issue at all.
[2015/11/15 12:36:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: Also, try restarting the level after pressing the action key while in edit mode.
[2015/11/15 12:36:23] <Tobbi> ok.
[2015/11/15 12:36:57] <Karkus> Actually, that's probably intended behaviour
[2015/11/15 12:37:21] <Karkus> Well, probably not.
[2015/11/15 12:37:34] <Tobbi> So, apparently we are still in edit mode.
[2015/11/15 12:38:33] <Karkus> Yup.
[2015/11/15 12:48:50] <grumbel> Tobbi: https://github.com/SuperTux/tinygettext/commit/d0155106c9b770f7ff28070c60f39337f12e8f47 there is no need to #ifdef that stuff out, all log callbacks are configurable

[2015/11/15 15:00:09] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: This has nothing to do with anything. This adds 1 line which isn't even code.
[2015/11/15 15:00:19] <brmbrmcar> And you forgot ci skip!
[2015/11/15 15:00:26] <Karkus> I did :(
[2015/11/15 15:00:38] <brmbrmcar> I do exactly the same.
[2015/11/15 15:00:50] <brmbrmcar> All my commits were useless.
[2015/11/15 15:01:30] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Talking about useless commits, what exactly does https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/220 do?
[2015/11/15 15:02:39] <brmbrmcar> Make Tux invincible (like when he gets a star).

[2015/11/15 15:04:41] <datahead7777> Karkus, grumbel was in, several people were talking, I saw Travis messages, etc.  head 8 debian had already said it was busy, and I agreed
[2015/11/15 15:04:53] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: But sector.Tux.make_invincible(true) does that
[2015/11/15 15:05:03] <maths22> Karkus: it will actually work on every push
[2015/11/15 15:05:12] <Karkus> datahead7777: I suppose it's more active than usual
[2015/11/15 15:05:25] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: But we need shortcuts.
[2015/11/15 15:05:26] <Karkus> maths22: To your repo?
[2015/11/15 15:05:37] <maths22> Right now
[2015/11/15 15:05:41] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: I don't know about that
[2015/11/15 15:05:53] <maths22> The idea is that it will be switched to run off of the offical
[2015/11/15 15:06:04] * maths22 hit enter too soon
[2015/11/15 15:06:08] <Karkus> maths22: Why can't we do that now?
[2015/11/15 15:06:12] <brmbrmcar> Like fire(), ice(), air() earth(), growup()
[2015/11/15 15:06:27] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Okay
[2015/11/15 15:06:31] <Karkus> Let me see
[2015/11/15 15:06:53] <maths22> Karkus: because certain aspects don't work quite right yet, and (mostly for windows) several things need to be changed besides .travis.yml
[2015/11/15 15:07:00] <brmbrmcar> invincible() was actually a full script,but it is so short...
[2015/11/15 15:07:06] <Karkus> maths22: Oh, I see
[2015/11/15 15:07:10] <maths22> I want to make sure everything works right before we merge
[2015/11/15 15:07:43] <brmbrmcar> Will tinygettext be in there?

[2015/11/15 15:10:04] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: I don't understand... what's wrong with invincible()
[2015/11/15 15:10:20] <brmbrmcar> It runs in a loop.
[2015/11/15 15:10:31] <Karkus> which one?
[2015/11/15 15:10:46] <brmbrmcar> invincible()
[2015/11/15 15:12:43] <brmbrmcar> The coin limit needs to be increased.
[2015/11/15 15:18:37] <maths22> brmbrmcar: what about tinygettext
[2015/11/15 15:18:46] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Also, what coin limit
[2015/11/15 15:19:04] * maths22 forgets that question marks are a thing
[2015/11/15 15:21:29] <brmbrmcar> Will sudo dpkg -i work straight away.
[2015/11/15 15:22:12] <brmbrmcar> THe coin limit is too low; I reached it without cheating.

[2015/11/15 15:29:16] <Tobbi> Actually, guys, there have been quite a few levels that were removed from bonus island 3 but never added somewhere else ;)
[2015/11/15 15:30:05] <brmbrmcar> Which ones?
[2015/11/15 15:31:26] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: A lot of them.
[2015/11/15 15:31:27] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/15 15:32:21] <Tobbi> Take a look at https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/levels/bonus3/changelog.txt
[2015/11/15 15:32:28] <brmbrmcar> There needs to be more target times.
[2015/11/15 15:33:25] <brmbrmcar> For Icy Island.
[2015/11/15 15:34:35] <brmbrmcar> And in Two Tiny Towers, dispensers need to be changed from auto to left.

[2015/11/15 15:47:12] <maths22> brmbrmcar: What is the coin limit?
[2015/11/15 15:47:46] <maths22> Also, if you mean will dpkg -i install tinygettext, the answer is yes
[2015/11/15 15:48:24] <brmbrmcar> 9999
[2015/11/15 15:51:00] <maths22> brmbrmcar: OK
[2015/11/15 15:51:11] <brmbrmcar> Which is too low.
[2015/11/15 15:51:14] <maths22> I'll have to work on hitting it sometime
[2015/11/15 15:51:19] <maths22> (No checkpoints for me)
[2015/11/15 15:51:27] <brmbrmcar> Where ist this set?
[2015/11/15 15:56:40] <brmbrmcar> I have changed in brmbrmcar:coins
[2015/11/15 16:11:58] <head8debian> Tobbi: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/1105f486/
[2015/11/15 16:12:14] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I think the better question to ask is: why do we have a coin limit?
[2015/11/15 16:12:36] <maths22> Is there a reason to keep it and increase it, or should it be eliminated?
[2015/11/15 16:12:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: does it work?
[2015/11/15 16:12:56] <maths22> head8debian: what is that for?
[2015/11/15 16:13:14] <brmbrmcar> To stop cheats.
[2015/11/15 16:13:32] <maths22> What kind of cheats does it stop?
[2015/11/15 16:14:05] <brmbrmcar> I don't know, someone who wants a load of checkpoints.
[2015/11/15 16:14:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't have the resistors for my photocells, so i don't know... :-/
[2015/11/15 16:14:19] <head8debian> maths22: An arduino.
[2015/11/15 16:14:22] <brmbrmcar> But we should let that happen anyway.
[2015/11/15 16:14:33] <head8debian> I honestly hope it will work.
[2015/11/15 16:14:36] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/15 16:14:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: I want to *sigh* also...
[2015/11/15 16:15:09] <maths22> brmbrmcar: with the console, you can already cheat in whatever way you want
[2015/11/15 16:15:11] <brmbrmcar> *bold*
[2015/11/15 16:15:17] <head8debian> Its taken alot of my energy trying to come up with that...
[2015/11/15 16:15:28] <brmbrmcar> maths22: I know, so the limit is useless.
[2015/11/15 16:15:45] <maths22> (I actually decided to not enable the console last time I wiped my config because I kept using fire() and ghost mode
[2015/11/15 16:15:49] <maths22> Ghost mode is so much fun ...
[2015/11/15 16:16:10] <brmbrmcar> But I don't want to remove it entirely, as doing so may cause bugs.
[2015/11/15 16:16:19] <brmbrmcar> How do you enable ghost mode?
[2015/11/15 16:16:39] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It should be set to INT_MAX
[2015/11/15 16:16:50] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/15 16:17:38] <maths22> I believe it is 'sector.Tux.ghost_mode(true)', but I may remember wrong
[2015/11/15 16:19:06] <brmbrmcar> The sector ghost_mode does not exist.

[2015/11/15 19:22:16] <maths22> I'm a little bit concerned with regards to the licensing on the new worldmap Restaurated island
[2015/11/15 19:22:27] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/15 19:22:58] <Tobbi> LMH: Try to print the value of that boolean flag m_langpack_mode or something to the console and then see what might be wrong.
[2015/11/15 19:23:13] <maths22> The fan site does not appear to have required uploaders to grant any rights to SuperTux/have given any license at all
[2015/11/15 19:23:57] <Tobbi> maths22: ...and it might be fairly difficult to get the original authors to grant the licenses in retrospective.
[2015/11/15 19:24:14] <Tobbi> maths22: Can't we make the whole worldmap "all rights reserved"?
[2015/11/15 19:24:27] <maths22> Tobbi: I don't disagree
[2015/11/15 19:24:43] <maths22> My concern is mostly with the "credit-taking" done in the intial level
[2015/11/15 19:24:57] <Tobbi> That will be fixed. LMH is working on it.
[2015/11/15 19:25:02] <maths22> Tobbi: great
[2015/11/15 19:25:04] <Tobbi> Or rather, has agreed to work on that.
[2015/11/15 19:25:09] <Tobbi> maths22: hume overshot a little.
[2015/11/15 19:25:42] <LMH> yeah, I didn't even think about the licensing
[2015/11/15 19:25:44] <maths22> Tobbi: we actually probably need to put something on that worldmap which explicitly "un-GPLs" it
[2015/11/15 19:25:56] <Tobbi> Yeah...
[2015/11/15 19:26:34] <Tobbi> maths22: On the other hand: If it's not under the GPL that means that hume had no rights to modify the contents of the levels in the first place.
[2015/11/15 19:26:43] <maths22> Tobbi: that is also probably true
[2015/11/15 19:27:04] <Tobbi> So, the legally right way would be to remove the worldmap altogether.
[2015/11/15 19:27:11] <maths22> Tobbi: that is actually correct
[2015/11/15 19:27:21] <maths22> We could distribute them unmodified, but then they would be unplayable
[2015/11/15 19:27:24] <LMH> anyone have access to the originals?  I'd like to know if any licensing was with the originals
[2015/11/15 19:27:43] <Tobbi> Many of them are on http://a062.apm.etc.tu-bs.de/pmlvls.php
[2015/11/15 19:27:58] <maths22> LMH: most of them don't seem to have licensing attached
[2015/11/15 19:27:59] <Tobbi> I even believe all of them.
[2015/11/15 19:28:21] <maths22> Tobbi: what do you mean?
[2015/11/15 19:28:32] <Tobbi> maths22: I believe all of them are from the fan site above.
[2015/11/15 19:28:46] <LMH> well, then the safe thing is to simply remove the addon
[2015/11/15 19:28:47] <maths22> Tobbi: given the intro, I think that is correct
[2015/11/15 19:28:55] <maths22> LMH: I sadly agree
[2015/11/15 19:29:00] <Tobbi> It's a shame, really...
[2015/11/15 19:29:16] <maths22> Especially given the work put into transforming them
[2015/11/15 19:29:18] <LMH> bah- wish I had thought of that first instead of cleaning up that intro
[2015/11/15 19:29:33] <maths22> LMH: actually, if possible, it should be removed from the git history and force pushed
[2015/11/15 19:30:23] <LMH> I can do that, might be messy for those who use the repo, but that should only be a few
[2015/11/15 19:31:06] <maths22> I agree, but that way we are defintely safe
[2015/11/15 19:31:08] <Not-6fa5> [02supertux] 03Success. The Travis CI build passed - 13https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux/builds/91295562
[2015/11/15 19:31:31] <maths22> LMH: By the way, I really like Fiona's world
[2015/11/15 19:31:43] <maths22> It's fun for if I want a worldmap that is easy to play through
[2015/11/15 19:31:55] <maths22> (Hume has some nice ones for the other end of the spectrum...)
[2015/11/15 19:32:07] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/15 19:34:39] <maths22> Also, if there is an updated fan site ever, any submissions should be required to be CC licensed
[2015/11/15 19:34:40] <LMH> maths22: thanks! that was the idea
[2015/11/15 19:34:49] <LMH> agreed
[2015/11/15 19:35:02] <maths22> (I think the CC license is more appropriate for levels than the GPL)
[2015/11/15 19:35:17] <LMH> of course the fan site was never an official piece of the project
[2015/11/15 19:35:17] <maths22> Since levels aren't source code, the GPL doesn't apply very well
[2015/11/15 19:35:28] <Tobbi> Couldn't we have our own site where people are allowed to upload their creations?
[2015/11/15 19:35:30] <maths22> LMH: I know
[2015/11/15 19:35:42] <maths22> Tobbi: yes
[2015/11/15 19:35:42] <LMH> Tobbi: that would be great
[2015/11/15 19:35:50] <Tobbi> I have been thinking about this, and it could integrate as well with the flexlay editor.
[2015/11/15 19:36:03] <Tobbi> Aka, allow people to upload levels directly from flexlay.
[2015/11/15 19:36:22] <maths22> Tobbi: if we have a clear vision, I am happy to work on the web-half implementation (and could probably provide the hosting)
[2015/11/15 19:36:24] <LMH> that would be cool
[2015/11/15 19:36:44] <Tobbi> maths22: Actually, file an issue against flexlay...
[2015/11/15 19:36:58] <Tobbi> maths22: How would the upload part look? POST?
[2015/11/15 19:37:12] <Tobbi> Sending a POST request from Python might be good.
[2015/11/15 19:37:18] <maths22> Tobbi: probably
[2015/11/15 19:37:18] <Tobbi> Or whatever there is.
[2015/11/15 19:37:37] <maths22> We would probably want to require authentication
[2015/11/15 19:37:43] <Tobbi> http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/ :P
[2015/11/15 19:37:47] <Tobbi> So, that's covered.
[2015/11/15 19:38:13] <maths22> Well, I'm off to dinner now
[2015/11/15 19:38:19] <Tobbi> sure.
[2015/11/15 19:38:20] <maths22> Good night to those of you in Europe
[2015/11/15 19:38:25] <Tobbi> good night.
[2015/11/15 19:38:30] <maths22> What time is it where you are?
[2015/11/15 19:39:18] <Tobbi> 1:37am
[2015/11/15 19:39:30] <maths22> 6:37 pm here
[2015/11/15 19:39:46] <LMH> 2:37 pm  here
[2015/11/15 19:40:40] <Tobbi> We're distributed all over the world, alright.
[2015/11/15 19:41:01] <maths22> I think it's kind of fun
[2015/11/15 19:41:10] <LMH> indeed
[2015/11/15 19:41:58] <Tobbi> So, I suggest a review queue where people from the team can review them before pushing them to the add-on repository...
[2015/11/15 19:42:00] <Tobbi> and stuff like that.
[2015/11/15 19:42:06] <Tobbi> But this is a huge undertaking anyway.
[2015/11/15 19:43:31] <maths22> A project for when I finish nightly builds
[2015/11/15 19:43:37] <maths22> :)
[2015/11/15 19:44:05] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/15 19:44:07] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/15 19:44:09] <Tobbi> Anyway, good night.
[2015/11/15 19:44:32] <LMH> we could tap into the community, let them rate levels and when they are seen as popular/stable enough we snag them for the repo
[2015/11/15 19:44:40] <LMH> oh, sorry good night
[2015/11/15 19:46:37] <Tobbi> LMH: That could work as well. But that's for post-0.4.0
[2015/11/15 19:47:06] <LMH> agreed
[2015/11/15 19:47:52] <Tobbi> LMH: So, can you file issues against the add-ons repository re. website etc.?
[2015/11/15 19:49:23] <LMH> Tobbi, I'm working on a full removal from the history, think we should tighten up access to that repo?
[2015/11/15 19:49:44] <Tobbi> LMH: We could. I believe HUme would complain, though.
[2015/11/15 19:49:53] <Tobbi> We just need to make sure that he sticks to the rules.
[2015/11/15 19:53:44] <LMH> he didn't follow the format either- we'll have to ask that he has anything reviewed first
[2015/11/15 19:54:18] <LMH> the addon repo is a little harder to deal with, requires some advanced knowledge
[2015/11/15 19:55:44] <Tobbi> I had trouble with it as well...
[2015/11/15 19:56:51] <LMH> I know, it is not trivial to work with- took me some time after it was remade to work properly
[2015/11/15 19:58:18] <Tobbi> LMH: But if we had a proper website with a backend, that would make things easier. We could create all the values automatically.
[2015/11/15 19:58:50] <LMH> that's true, would save me a lot of time when changing addons
[2015/11/15 20:09:09] @ Quit: Tobbi: 
[2015/11/15 20:30:42] <maths22> A proper website would be a very nice thing, and a nice future project
[2015/11/15 20:33:26] <maths22> Also, do we have a proper 0.4.0 todo list?
[2015/11/15 20:35:28] <LMH> maths22: I have not checked the todos for some time so honestly I'm not sure what state they are in.  I do agree that the website could use a bit of an overhaul.

[2015/11/16 12:56:53] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Was there any discussion about Restaured Island I removal?
[2015/11/16 12:57:10] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Not that I'm aware of.
[2015/11/16 12:58:06] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Someone has to explain LMH what the Restaurator Island I is. He is often not there unfortunately.
[2015/11/16 12:58:39] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Yes.
[2015/11/16 12:58:47] <Hume2> We should reformulate the red part to make it clear to LMH.
[2015/11/16 12:59:13] <Hume2> Could you help me? Just write me a text file and I'll put it into the infoblocks.
[2015/11/16 12:59:27] <brmbrmcar> OK...
[2015/11/16 12:59:39] <brmbrmcar> So about the copyright stuff?
[2015/11/16 12:59:47] <Hume2> Yes, exactly.
[2015/11/16 13:00:23] <Hume2> I don't know the law terms in the other languages, so that's why I ask you to do it.

[2015/11/16 13:37:59] <brmbrmcar> Ok.
[2015/11/16 13:38:10] <brmbrmcar> I am restauring the next level.

[2015/11/16 13:44:19] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Thanks, but I still had some notes for levels 6 and 7.
[2015/11/16 13:44:51] <brmbrmcar> I thought I'd have to finish 7.
[2015/11/16 13:45:03] <brmbrmcar> The empty bonus blocks...
[2015/11/16 13:45:50] <Hume2> Well...
[2015/11/16 13:46:03] <brmbrmcar> I shall fix now.
[2015/11/16 13:46:36] <brmbrmcar> What shall I replace them with?
[2015/11/16 13:47:14] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It's hard to explain when you can't see me while working on it.
[2015/11/16 13:47:34] <brmbrmcar> Snow?
[2015/11/16 13:47:48] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes. You know me :D
[2015/11/16 13:48:23] <Hume2> I'll give you some examples of proper terrain: snow, darksow, forest ground, stone brick walls ...
[2015/11/16 13:49:16] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You can't get bellow those blocks, so the empty space bellow them is useless.
[2015/11/16 13:50:10] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Do you know Narreland? There's one strange thing that is in most of the Narreland levels. Do you know what is it?
[2015/11/16 13:50:38] <brmbrmcar> Is it the snow covering the feet?
[2015/11/16 13:51:05] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: That's hard to say.
[2015/11/16 13:51:39] <brmbrmcar> What is it then?
[2015/11/16 13:51:52] <Hume2> I make it usually not-covering the feet, because of the flames.
[2015/11/16 13:52:19] <Hume2> When you set the z-pos of interactive layer to 51, it covers the feet...
[2015/11/16 13:53:02] <Hume2> ...but it covers also all the flames, so they hide in the terrain and it's tricky to pass them.

[2015/11/16 13:58:18] <Hume2> It's contraproductive. So I'll remove the red part.

[2015/11/16 15:20:52] <maths22> You posted it above
[2015/11/16 15:23:14] <brmbrmcar> I made it myself.
[2015/11/16 15:23:38] <brmbrmcar> Noone owns any rights tyo it.
[2015/11/16 15:24:05] <maths22> brmbrmcar: My quesiton is because, at least under US copyright law, it is not really correct
[2015/11/16 15:24:33] <maths22> For something to qualify as "fair use" in the US, it must satisfy 4 conditions in some combination
[2015/11/16 15:24:47] <maths22> (US copyright law is confusing, but here is the basic idea)
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the purpose and character of your use
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the nature of the copyrighted work
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the effect of the use upon the potential market.
[2015/11/16 15:25:07] <brmbrmcar> Yeah, but think of it this way: if we were that strict on copyright, everything would be banned.
[2015/11/16 15:25:12] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Nope
[2015/11/16 15:25:19] <maths22> Most of our stuff has a CC license
[2015/11/16 15:25:22] <maths22> that lets us use it
[2015/11/16 15:25:49] <maths22> By default, we cannot use anything-permission must be explicitly granted (except for the specific carve-outs for "fair use")
[2015/11/16 15:25:54] <brmbrmcar> And also, how does this apply internationally?
[2015/11/16 15:26:15] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I can look into that, that said, I assume we want to be allowed to distribute the game in the US
[2015/11/16 15:26:38] <brmbrmcar> Exactly.
[2015/11/16 15:26:47] <brmbrmcar> It needs to be legal everywhere.
[2015/11/16 15:27:31] <maths22> CC licenses are "certified" as internationally valid
[2015/11/16 15:27:59] <brmbrmcar> THink of it this way: if Hukme
[2015/11/16 15:28:00] <maths22> (The GPL, while also internationally valid, does not apply to levels, which are really data not source code)
[2015/11/16 15:28:20] <brmbrmcar> randomally created those levels, would that be illegel?
[2015/11/16 15:28:34] <maths22> brmbrmcar: no, but that is irrelevant
[2015/11/16 15:28:50] <maths22> It is a known fact that they were created from the fan site levels
[2015/11/16 15:29:11] <maths22> His ability to create them independently does not make them any less tied to the originals
[2015/11/16 15:30:11] <brmbrmcar> But it is relevant, nbecause it is exactly the same.
[2015/11/16 15:30:29] <brmbrmcar> The proccess is not important.
[2015/11/16 15:30:35] <maths22> brmbrmcar: That is not true
[2015/11/16 15:30:50] <maths22> If I looked at the fan site levels, and Hume's levels, they would clearly be related
[2015/11/16 15:31:02] <maths22> Further, we have documentation, in several forms, that they are related
[2015/11/16 15:31:18] <maths22> Therefore, legally, Hume's levels are a derivative work of the original
[2015/11/16 15:32:20] <brmbrmcar> OK then. You win.
[2015/11/16 15:32:36] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I feel sorry for Hume, because I can tell he put a lot of work into the levels
[2015/11/16 15:32:43] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2015/11/16 15:33:12] <brmbrmcar> And I tried restoring some levels, and it isn't as easy as it sounds.
[2015/11/16 15:33:41] <maths22> LMH, Tobbi, and I discussed it last night, and collectively determined that, at least without consulting a lawyer, it would not be a good idea to keep the addon as part of the project
[2015/11/16 15:35:45] <brmbrmcar> :(

[2015/11/16 17:19:00] <maths22> Tobbi: the "metal" ones don't really look out of place in an icy world
[2015/11/16 17:19:09] <maths22> I can't say the same about the wooden ones
[2015/11/16 17:19:13] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/16 17:19:24] <Tobbi> I think the wooden ones look rather ugly...
[2015/11/16 17:19:41] <maths22> To me, the cannons work, but if someone wanted, they could add some icicles or something like that
[2015/11/16 17:19:48] <maths22> Tobbi: I must agree on the wooden ones
[2015/11/16 17:20:04] <maths22> It does not help that half of the levels that use them just have them floating in the air
[2015/11/16 17:20:09] <Tobbi> Sometimes we don't want to show any dispenser...
[2015/11/16 17:20:19] <maths22> In my opinion, they should be ceiling mounted, in a cloud, or invisible
[2015/11/16 17:20:25] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/16 17:20:34] <Tobbi> But in a cloud, we sometimes don't want the dispenser to be visible.
[2015/11/16 17:20:36] <maths22> Also, why does fireflower no longer destroy dispensers?
[2015/11/16 17:20:44] <Tobbi> Change made by hume someday.
[2015/11/16 17:20:47] <maths22> Tobbi: In theory, the cloud should cover up the dispenser
[2015/11/16 17:21:05] <Tobbi> maths22: It does, but I'd rather have a flag on the dispenser that sets it to hidden.
[2015/11/16 17:21:06] <maths22> Tobbi: Same with why it doesn't destroy crystallo?
[2015/11/16 17:21:15] <Tobbi> Because fire shouldn
[2015/11/16 17:21:19] <Tobbi> 't melt a crystal.
[2015/11/16 17:21:23] <maths22> Tobbi: this is true
[2015/11/16 17:21:26] <Tobbi> But that's also a change hume introduced.
[2015/11/16 17:21:51] <maths22> Then again, fire also shouldn't melt the spiky shells, but we kind of have to ignore that
[2015/11/16 17:22:17] <maths22> Also, in my opinion, the new forest jumpy graphics are not the most attractive
[2015/11/16 17:22:25] <Tobbi> True...
[2015/11/16 17:22:30] <Tobbi> Maybe we should reset them?
[2015/11/16 17:22:41] <maths22> Tobbi: the metal ones didn't look out of place
[2015/11/16 17:22:57] <Tobbi> maths22: Yes, I agree... can you undo the changes?
[2015/11/16 17:23:11] <maths22> Tobbi: not right now, but I will try to remember for later
[2015/11/16 17:23:17] <Tobbi> Or I could.
[2015/11/16 17:23:20] <Tobbi> I'll have to see..
[2015/11/16 17:27:12] <Tobbi> maths22: Do I keep the sprites themselves for reference or do I revert that commit as well?

[2015/11/17 10:40:00] <brmbrmcar> Any news on that retaured island 1?
[2015/11/17 10:40:33] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I changed everything needed, but didn't posted anything so far.
[2015/11/17 10:41:10] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: OK, then.
[2015/11/17 10:41:44] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I thought a new path mode, unordered.
[2015/11/17 10:41:51] <brmbrmcar> Apparently there was a discussion about it, but it was in the middle of the night.
[2015/11/17 10:41:57] <brmbrmcar> The path mode?
[2015/11/17 10:42:15] <Hume2> You know, we have circular, pingpong and oneshot.
[2015/11/17 10:42:27] <Hume2> Circular is default.
[2015/11/17 10:42:51] <brmbrmcar> Ah. Sothat.
[2015/11/17 10:43:09] <brmbrmcar> I always found it hard using paths.
[2015/11/17 10:43:29] <Hume2> Let'
[2015/11/17 10:43:54] <Hume2> Let's say that you have a platform and several places where it should go.
[2015/11/17 10:44:03] <brmbrmcar> Does it need testing before it can be merged?
[2015/11/17 10:44:16] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: No, but Tobbi could rage :D
[2015/11/17 10:44:49] <Hume2> I know that he doesn't rage, but he says "*sigh*".
[2015/11/17 10:45:02] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: ok, lets keep him calm.
[2015/11/17 10:46:56] <Hume2> I think that this mode could be useful for scripting.
[2015/11/17 10:49:10] <brmbrmcar> Yes, I agree.
[2015/11/17 10:50:04] <brmbrmcar> And also, it isn't as much hassle because the level editor is no longer maintained.
[2015/11/17 10:50:39] <Hume2> Oh, the editor.

[2015/11/17 10:53:58] <Hume2> It's now kind of harder work... I have to add many classes...
[2015/11/17 10:54:18] <Hume2> That's why I have time for level design but not for editor.
[2015/11/17 10:54:58] <brmbrmcar> Level editors must be hard to make!
[2015/11/17 10:55:00] <Hume2> The worst is that it's not hard at all, but it's much writing.
[2015/11/17 10:55:33] <brmbrmcar> Yes. You have to get it to input everything.
[2015/11/17 10:55:46] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2015/11/17 10:56:05] <Hume2> Well, my plan:
[2015/11/17 10:56:48] <Hume2> After 0.4.0 will be released, I'll move the editor branch to origin, so everyone could contribute.
[2015/11/17 10:57:13] <brmbrmcar> Yay!
[2015/11/17 10:58:03] <brmbrmcar> Is there any talk of a release date for 0.4.0? Because some people will be dying to know....
[2015/11/17 10:58:36] <Hume2> I don't know anything else except that it'll be on X-mas 2015.
[2015/11/17 10:58:46] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/17 10:58:55] <brmbrmcar> When all the bugs are fixed.
[2015/11/17 10:59:28] <Hume2> That would take much longer time.
[2015/11/17 11:00:29] <brmbrmcar> Yes, completely.
[2015/11/17 11:01:16] <Hume2> Do you know, what I did with the switches recently?
[2015/11/17 11:01:26] <Hume2> It was today.
[2015/11/17 11:01:38] <brmbrmcar> Made them bi something
[2015/11/17 11:02:02] <brmbrmcar> bistable
[2015/11/17 11:02:35] <Hume2> Yes. Thay can be now used to turn something on and off.
[2015/11/17 11:02:52] <brmbrmcar> Nice!
[2015/11/17 11:03:07] <Hume2> This could be done before, but now the lever is down when it's turned on.
[2015/11/17 11:03:26] <brmbrmcar> THat is more clear.
[2015/11/17 11:03:35] <Hume2> It's in Magic Block Test.
[2015/11/17 11:04:31] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2015/11/17 11:04:40] <brmbrmcar> Will people useit?

[2015/11/17 11:11:37] <Hume2> sector.Tux.set_bonus(<bonus>) should work.
[2015/11/17 11:13:03] <brmbrmcar> The index no longer exists...
[2015/11/17 11:14:31] <Hume2> I have no idea.

[2015/11/17 11:45:15] <Hume2> Karkus: Do you know what bistability is?
[2015/11/17 11:46:10] <Hume2> You can set an off-script and the switch is bistable then. When you don't set it, it acts as before.
[2015/11/17 11:46:27] <Hume2> And I opened a pull request.
[2015/11/17 11:50:02] <brmbrmcar> It can't be merged yet.
[2015/11/17 11:50:47] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Well, if someone tests it, I can.
[2015/11/17 11:51:14] <Karkus> Hume2: Okay, I get it
[2015/11/17 11:51:43] <Hume2> Karkus: Did you get what that means or you tested it?
[2015/11/17 11:51:55] <Karkus> Hume2: I understand the meaning
[2015/11/17 11:52:01] <Hume2> OK
[2015/11/17 11:52:01] <Karkus> Do you want me to test it?
[2015/11/17 11:52:15] <Hume2> That would be good.
[2015/11/17 11:52:38] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: You don't want to make Tobbi angery...
[2015/11/17 11:53:13] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: He decides faster when more people test it.

[2015/11/17 11:54:08] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: I k-now.
[2015/11/17 11:54:16] <Hume2> Karkus, yes, it is.
[2015/11/17 11:54:39] <Hume2> We are talking about merging, that can make Tobbi angry :D
[2015/11/17 11:54:54] <brmbrmcar> Why though?
[2015/11/17 11:55:19] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: He likes to be in control of the merging
[2015/11/17 11:55:32] <Hume2> ^ This
[2015/11/17 11:55:39] <brmbrmcar> He thinks he's in control of all Supertux.
[2015/11/17 11:55:56] <Karkus> Hume2: This does not appear to be related to Bistable switches
[2015/11/17 11:56:06] <Hume2> I know.
[2015/11/17 11:56:17] <Hume2> Bistable switches are in master.
[2015/11/17 11:56:23] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: And at the moment, he might as well be. He has worked to keep this project going
[2015/11/17 11:56:34] <Karkus> Hume2: You pushed straight to master???
[2015/11/17 11:56:50] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: Hume2:master
[2015/11/17 11:57:23] <Hume2> For bistable switches: They don't affect gameplay at all, because they are never used.
[2015/11/17 11:57:54] <brmbrmcar> Oh yeah.THose.
[2015/11/17 11:57:57] <Hume2> ...but test it please anyway. It's in Magic Block Test.
[2015/11/17 11:58:03] <brmbrmcar> This is confusing...
[2015/11/17 11:58:53] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: Any progress?
[2015/11/17 11:59:02] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: With...?
[2015/11/17 11:59:42] <Hume2> There are three switches in Magic Block Test. Just press them.
[2015/11/17 12:00:17] <Karkus> Hume2: Are you talking about hume2:master?
[2015/11/17 12:00:17] <Hume2> This may have higher priority than the unordered path.
[2015/11/17 12:00:28] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: building the ltest version/testing it.
[2015/11/17 12:00:41] <Hume2> Karkus: Bistable switches are in origin:master.
[2015/11/17 12:01:01] <Karkus> Hume2: Okay, I will test that after
[2015/11/17 12:01:13] <Karkus> Just need to build unordered path
[2015/11/17 12:01:33] <brmbrmcar> Karkus the builder!
[2015/11/17 12:01:51] <Hume2> Karkus: You can test the bistable switches in the same build.
[2015/11/17 12:02:37] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: So the scripts are independent?
[2015/11/17 12:02:39] <Karkus> Hume2: Are they in unordered_path branch?
[2015/11/17 12:04:31] <Hume2> Karkus: Unordered path is in hume2:unordered_path and bistable switches are in both.
[2015/11/17 12:04:40] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes.
[2015/11/17 12:05:28] <Karkus> Hume2: Is there a test level for bistable switches?

[2015/11/17 12:40:39] <brmbrmcar> invincible() is a script, not a function.

[2015/11/17 12:43:23] <brmbrmcar> An insane one is kill Tux when the level is finished.
[2015/11/17 12:46:10] <maths22> brmbrmcar: this is true.  However,  I think we should kill Tux when the level starts; then all levels are perfect since no one can play any of them :)

[2015/11/17 13:24:53] <Hume2> And I got that there are easter eggs in some forest levels.
[2015/11/17 13:26:26] <brmbrmcar> Ahoj, tady Hume2, co tomu ?k??
[2015/11/17 13:26:36] <Hume2> Yes.
[2015/11/17 13:27:04] <Hume2> In the WolfgangB's levels, there are texts made of invisible blocks saying "W.B.6/2006"
[2015/11/17 13:27:11] <brmbrmcar> What does it mean?
[2015/11/17 13:27:42] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It means: "Hello, here's Hume2, what do you say to this?"
[2015/11/17 13:28:38] <brmbrmcar> Nice.

[2015/11/17 17:53:37] <Karkus> Why?
[2015/11/17 17:54:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: Just saying. :P I am not expecting German comments at all :D
[2015/11/17 17:55:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: I misinterpreted the "from you"
[2015/11/17 17:55:08] <Tobbi> Ah, right.
[2015/11/17 17:55:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: Was sind drei Nazis in der Ecke?

[2015/11/17 17:55:51] <Tobbi> Karkus: Ein rechter Winkel.
[2015/11/17 17:56:57] <Tobbi> Okay, it only makes proper sense in German.
[2015/11/17 17:56:59] * Karkus thinks, and then looks up "Winkel"
[2015/11/17 17:57:16] <Tobbi> angle.
[2015/11/17 17:57:24] <Karkus> Oh
[2015/11/17 17:57:25] <Karkus> I get it
[2015/11/17 17:57:46] <Karkus> Ecke is corner?

[2015/11/17 17:58:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: Correct.
[2015/11/17 17:58:37] <Karkus> I have a feeling I've heard a similar English joke
[2015/11/17 18:00:23] <Tobbi> Geht ein Vergewaltiger mit einem kleinen Jungen in den Wald. Sagt der Junge "Ganz schön gruselig hier", sagt der Vergewaltiger "Was soll ich denn sagen, ich muss nachher alleine nach Hause".
[2015/11/17 18:03:51] <Karkus> Vergewaltiger?
[2015/11/17 18:04:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: rapist.
[2015/11/17 18:04:48] <Karkus> Tobbi: I wonder why I don't know that word?

[2015/11/17 18:14:35] <Tobbi> Yes, definitely.

[2015/11/17 18:16:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats that stand for? Emitting steam out of a smoke stack?
[2015/11/17 18:16:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: Should we notify the user of https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/228 util we fix it?
[2015/11/17 18:16:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: I did that already.... https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commit/adeb18125f971f681d5d8e9d0c6cab87d42db5e8
[2015/11/17 18:17:12] <Tobbi> "Please restart SuperTux for these changes to take effect." is proper English, isn't it?
[2015/11/17 18:17:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: Perfect English
[2015/11/17 18:17:50] <Tobbi> Good
[2015/11/17 18:18:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: When does this appear?
[2015/11/17 18:18:11] <Karkus> When you change language?
[2015/11/17 18:18:12] <Tobbi> Karkus: upon enabling / disabling a language pack.
[2015/11/17 18:18:24] <Tobbi> Actually...I wonder what happens if you install language packs for the first time.
[2015/11/17 18:18:53] <Karkus> What is a language pack? Is this a new thing?
[2015/11/17 18:19:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: An add-on that contains new strings.
[2015/11/17 18:19:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Seperate to the actual addons?
[2015/11/17 18:19:28] <Tobbi> Aka, new .po files.

[2015/11/17 18:20:13] <Tobbi> Take a look at https://github.com/SuperTux/addons/tree/master/src/langpack-de
[2015/11/17 18:21:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah, I see. Is this one installed automatically then? (Seeing halloween 2014 there)
[2015/11/17 18:21:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, you need to check for them.
[2015/11/17 18:21:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/17 18:21:58] <Tobbi> Installing automatically can get difficult.

[2015/11/17 18:26:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: Here's a question: Why are the language names on the language list all in English?
[2015/11/17 18:26:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, that can be changed easily.
[2015/11/17 18:26:40] <Tobbi> It was / is merely a test.
[2015/11/17 18:27:05] <Karkus> I think we should put a small globe button on the main menu to change language, rather than navigating through in a foreign one
[2015/11/17 18:27:18] <Tobbi> Sure, go ahead.
[2015/11/17 18:27:33] <Karkus> Okay
[2015/11/17 18:28:30] <leper`> but that takes all the fun away, you'll never have to remember which item in the menu was the correct one when you set the game to a language where you can't even read the letters

[2015/11/18 10:52:01] <brmbrmcar> Hi!
[2015/11/18 10:55:37] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Any idea what LMH means by "check with others first"?
[2015/11/18 10:55:51] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/18 10:55:57] <Hume2> ...for Restaured Island I.
[2015/11/18 10:56:55] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Nooo.#
[2015/11/18 10:57:33] <brmbrmcar> He already discussed it himself.
[2015/11/18 10:58:03] <Hume2> Let's do it this way. Do you know anyone who hasn't tested it so far?
[2015/11/18 10:58:16] <Hume2> Well, I tested it.
[2015/11/18 10:58:31] <Hume2> It looks like Tobbi has tested it as well.
[2015/11/18 10:58:42] <brmbrmcar> I tested it, of course.
[2015/11/18 10:59:31] <Hume2> That's what I expected. It looks like Max Teufel has tested it too.
[2015/11/18 10:59:51] <Hume2> ...beacuse he had some notes to it.
[2015/11/18 11:00:39] <brmbrmcar> I just cheated the whole thing, so I could test every level without spending time getting past tricky parts.
[2015/11/18 11:01:09] <brmbrmcar> And I stand with what I have said; the levels are heavily modified.
[2015/11/18 11:01:11] <Hume2> That's what I did with Dark world.
[2015/11/18 11:01:43] <Hume2> So the licencing is OK.
[2015/11/18 11:02:06] <Hume2> You will be in special thanks after it will be added again.
[2015/11/18 11:02:28] <brmbrmcar> It will be added. I am determind.

[2015/11/18 11:03:49] <Hume2> I think that Karkus looks like he wouldn't pass it untested. I'll ask him.
[2015/11/18 11:04:29] <Hume2> leyyin_: Did you tested Restaured Island I until LMH deleted it?
[2015/11/18 11:04:35] <brmbrmcar> Karkus will probably be here soon.
[2015/11/18 11:04:51] <leyyin_> Hume2, no, sorry
[2015/11/18 11:05:27] <brmbrmcar> Aw.

[2015/11/18 11:07:11] <Hume2> It's the old version. The new vesion differs only by the intro and extro.
[2015/11/18 11:09:09] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/18 11:09:18] <brmbrmcar> Where new one?
[2015/11/18 11:09:30] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I'll add it now.

[2015/11/18 11:29:22] <maths22> We have no right to do anything with the fan site levels
[2015/11/18 11:29:44] <maths22> They did not grant us a license, and heavy modification simply makes them a derivative work
[2015/11/18 11:29:52] <maths22> The original copyright holds on derivative works
[2015/11/18 11:30:30] <maths22> We may not like that, and I really appreciate the effort that was put into the worldmap, but that doesn't make it legal
[2015/11/18 11:31:23] <brmbrmcar> What the hell?

[2015/11/18 11:32:13] <brmbrmcar> But we still disagree.
[2015/11/18 11:32:22] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Was any license specifies
[2015/11/18 11:32:23] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I thought we had ended in agreement.
[2015/11/18 11:32:28] <Karkus> specified?
[2015/11/18 11:32:36] <brmbrmcar> maths22: Yes, that one.
[2015/11/18 11:32:50] <maths22> brmbrmcar: then how do we disagree
[2015/11/18 11:32:53] <maths22> ?
[2015/11/18 11:33:25] <brmbrmcar> Arguing and disagreeing are different.
[2015/11/18 11:33:41] <maths22> By argument, I meant claim
[2015/11/18 11:33:45] <maths22> not debate
[2015/11/18 11:34:17] <brmbrmcar> You are very confusing.
[2015/11/18 11:34:20] <maths22> Karkus: the fan site has no grant of license, and the levels I checked do not have licenses attached
[2015/11/18 11:34:41] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I'm sorry.  I was trying to be clear, but evidently I failed
[2015/11/18 11:34:45] <Karkus> maths22: Can I have a link to the fan site?
[2015/11/18 11:34:58] <Karkus> maths22: Made sense to me...
[2015/11/18 11:35:04] <maths22> Karkus: http://a062.apm.etc.tu-bs.de/pmlvls.php?frn=0&snr=30&ord=odif
[2015/11/18 11:35:44] <Hume2> mats22: What country are you from?
[2015/11/18 11:35:59] <maths22> Hume2: United States
[2015/11/18 11:36:19] <maths22> That said, this aspect of copyright is fairly similar in the EU to the best of my knowledge
[2015/11/18 11:36:37] <Hume2> It is similar but not the same.
[2015/11/18 11:37:00] <maths22> Hume2: I know.  Hence why I defered to LMH and Tobbi for a european perspective
[2015/11/18 11:37:30] <brmbrmcar> And you can't copyright everything.
[2015/11/18 11:37:42] <mt> (in Germany) If there's no license specified it is to assume that the original creator has all the rights until 70 years after their death
[2015/11/18 11:38:04] <brmbrmcar> If copyright was this bad, nothing would belegal.
[2015/11/18 11:38:10] <maths22> brmbrmcar: that is not true
[2015/11/18 11:38:39] <maths22> You can use things without violating copyright
[2015/11/18 11:38:49] <maths22> You can even often modify them for personal use
[2015/11/18 11:39:15] <maths22> But you can't modify and distribute them without some kind of permission from the original copyright holder
[2015/11/18 11:39:28] <maths22> Hence why in the open source world, we use licenses
[2015/11/18 11:39:29] <head8debian> maths22: Exactly.
[2015/11/18 11:39:40] <Hume2> maths22: Read the new intro.
[2015/11/18 11:39:45] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but if things were like this and you copyrighted maths22, you would never be allowed to say the word maths.
[2015/11/18 11:40:01] <head8debian> oh brother...
[2015/11/18 11:40:21] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I cannot copyright maths22 even if I wanted to
[2015/11/18 11:40:26] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Trade names are trade marks.
[2015/11/18 11:40:43] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Copyright protects intellectual property
[2015/11/18 11:40:46] <maths22> I might be able to trademark it, so someone else couldn't claim to be me and do buisness as me
[2015/11/18 11:40:54] <brmbrmcar> It is purely an  example.
[2015/11/18 11:41:15] <maths22> The principle is that copyright protects the specific execution of an idea, and not the idea itself
[2015/11/18 11:41:28] <Hume2> Please stop this empty discussion and read the new intro. https://github.com/Hume2/addons/blob/6461cbcd31e7dafd6e255540bbb2dbbf9a2fc91b/src/restaurator1/levels/restaurator1/intro.txt
[2015/11/18 11:41:50] <maths22> Hume2: that is an unfounded claim
[2015/11/18 11:41:57] <maths22> It is clearly a derivative work
[2015/11/18 11:41:58] <mt> derivations of works are *not* legal
[2015/11/18 11:42:11] <mt> (without the permission of the copyright holder)
[2015/11/18 11:42:13] <maths22> You even say that yourself by saying that there *is* an original author
[2015/11/18 11:42:29] <maths22> As a derivative work, it does not somehow lose the original copyright
[2015/11/18 11:42:45] <maths22> It actually can only exist if the original copyright holder has granted permission for it
[2015/11/18 11:43:18] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/18 11:43:29] <brmbrmcar> Well, it is in plan English.
[2015/11/18 11:44:12] <maths22> head8debian: you can see why I am tired of this conversation///
[2015/11/18 11:44:21] <maths22> (That was supposed to be an elipsis)
[2015/11/18 11:45:10] <Hume2> Taking the idea of the level is legal. Have you ever compared those levels with the my ones?
[2015/11/18 11:45:18] <brmbrmcar> Well, no one complained before the subject was brought up.
[2015/11/18 11:46:12] <brmbrmcar> ume2: Exactly.
[2015/11/18 11:46:39] <Hume2> Well, let's make some rules for complaining.
[2015/11/18 11:46:53] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/18 11:46:54] <mt> If you say you took the idea of a level you're saying you took intellectual property from the original author.

[2015/11/18 11:47:42] <Hume2> Inspiration is legal, because noone can ever get where I was really inspired.
[2015/11/18 11:48:14] <Hume2> If taking the idea was illegal, then there would be no legal art work since 1900.
[2015/11/18 11:48:22] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/18 11:48:29] <maths22> Tobbi: Welcome!
[2015/11/18 11:48:29] <Tobbi> It's more than an inspiration...
[2015/11/18 11:48:34] <Tobbi> Yes, thank you.
[2015/11/18 11:48:50] <maths22> Tobbi: This is true.  We are literally citing the original author and using the original title
[2015/11/18 11:49:05] <brmbrmcar> Hume2 is right.
[2015/11/18 11:49:32] <Hume2> 80% of tiles are changed.
[2015/11/18 11:49:45] <Tobbi> The overall look isn't.
[2015/11/18 11:50:07] <Hume2> Have you compared it?
[2015/11/18 11:50:17] <maths22> Hume2: A numeric percent of tiles changed doesn't tell me anything
[2015/11/18 11:50:34] <maths22> I could get 100% tiles changed converting a level from the forest world to the ice world
[2015/11/18 11:50:45] <maths22> That wouldn't make it any less of a derivative work
[2015/11/18 11:50:56] <brmbrmcar> maths22:Yes, it does.
[2015/11/18 11:51:04] <Tobbi> ffs, no it doesn't.
[2015/11/18 11:51:11] <Tobbi> The arrangement of the tiles is significant.
[2015/11/18 11:51:15] <Tobbi> Aka, the overall look
[2015/11/18 11:51:38] <Tobbi> We have been over this...
[2015/11/18 11:51:56] <maths22> Tobbi: this is our 3rd time
[2015/11/18 11:51:56] <mt> brmbrmcar: Go ask your lawyer if you don't believe us. If you can't afford one, there's probably some subreddit where you can ask as well
[2015/11/18 11:52:01] <Hume2> Well, LMH stole me the rotating coins :D
[2015/11/18 11:52:07] <maths22> brmbrmcar's 2nd
[2015/11/18 11:52:18] <Tobbi> So.
[2015/11/18 11:52:35] <Tobbi> Guys if you want, ask for permission with every original author...
[2015/11/18 11:52:40] <brmbrmcar> Why did you lot even start this argument?
[2015/11/18 11:52:44] <Tobbi> Though some of them will likely not be available any longer.
[2015/11/18 11:53:11] <maths22> brmbrmcar: because when I first played the worldmap, I thought to check on the licencing
[2015/11/18 11:53:19] <maths22> And noticed that it did not work
[2015/11/18 11:53:35] <maths22> Since it is a bad idea to violate copyright, I asked other peoples' opinions
[2015/11/18 11:53:54] <brmbrmcar> I can't be bothered with licenses.I would let someone modify my work.
[2015/11/18 11:54:07] <Tobbi> So that would make it PD...
[2015/11/18 11:54:19] <Tobbi> And that needs to be specified.
[2015/11/18 11:54:36] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Although it is nice to know that you would not pursue someone for copyright violation, that would not make other people any less in violation
[2015/11/18 11:54:45] <maths22> Hence why we use licences
[2015/11/18 11:55:04] <maths22> If I saw your work, and there wasn't a licence, I wouldn't take the risk of using it
[2015/11/18 11:55:05] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I would guess your original age is around 13-16 from what you wrote...
[2015/11/18 11:55:16] <Tobbi> no license = all rights reserved.
[2015/11/18 11:55:27] <maths22> How do I know that you won't come after me for copyright infringement sometime later
[2015/11/18 11:55:46] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/18 11:55:52] <brmbrmcar> So if I even think of something,you say that is copyright?
[2015/11/18 11:55:59] <Karkus> What Tobbi just said is just how it works, brmbrmcar. Don't argue with us about it
[2015/11/18 11:56:23] <maths22> brmbrmcar: No, but if you write it down, that writing is copyrighted
[2015/11/18 11:56:25] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: You need proof too
[2015/11/18 11:56:26] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Thinking of something doesn't make it art. Putting it into action does make it art.
[2015/11/18 11:56:29] <brmbrmcar> Well, then don't make a silly argument.
[2015/11/18 11:56:48] <brmbrmcar> Personal use.
[2015/11/18 11:56:51] <Karkus> *sigh*
[2015/11/18 11:57:07] <brmbrmcar> You say personal use is copyright now?
[2015/11/18 11:57:37] <Karkus> No. You can do that
[2015/11/18 11:57:54] <mt> What we do is a) not personal use and b) even copyright can apply for personal use under some jurisdictions
[2015/11/18 11:57:55] <Karkus> You cannot distribute it though, I think
[2015/11/18 11:58:04] <maths22> Karkus: this would be correct
[2015/11/18 11:58:13] <maths22> For the most part, copyright actually applies to personal use
[2015/11/18 11:58:49] <maths22> Its just that there is no way for anyone to find out
[2015/11/18 11:58:54] <brmbrmcar> And, anyway, why is the addons repository so strict?
[2015/11/18 11:59:15] <Tobbi> Okay this is enough for now.
[2015/11/18 11:59:19] <brmbrmcar> Why does it need thorough checking before adding?
[2015/11/18 11:59:23] <Karkus> This is the world, not the addons repo.
[2015/11/18 11:59:29] <maths22> Tobbi: I agree
[2015/11/18 11:59:29] <brmbrmcar> OK, this is enough.
[2015/11/18 11:59:33] <Tobbi> Good.
[2015/11/18 11:59:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/18 11:59:39] <brmbrmcar> End!
[2015/11/18 11:59:43] <brmbrmcar> For now...

[2015/11/18 13:42:53] <head8debian> Great, i "bricked" my GPS... :p
[2015/11/18 13:48:59] <brmbrmcar> Bad!
[2015/11/18 13:54:38] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes, you can delete that level.
[2015/11/18 13:56:06] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: OK...
[2015/11/18 13:57:22] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Could we have a private talk?
[2015/11/18 13:57:27] <brmbrmcar> Aw flip...
[2015/11/18 13:57:49] <Not-6fa5> [02supertux] 07Karkus476 commented on issue 03#229: Stop doors fom blacking out the screen when they aren't being used - 13http://git.io/v4icO
[2015/11/18 13:57:52] <Tobbi> That either means something good or something very bad..
[2015/11/18 13:58:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: Doors black out the screen in case you enter them... However, you can simply not go through them, yet the screen will be blacked out for some time.
[2015/11/18 13:58:47] <Tobbi> And i believe this is what he is complaining about in that issue.
[2015/11/18 13:59:24] <Tobbi> I don't know a solution to that anyway.
[2015/11/18 13:59:46] <Tobbi> However, we could have that blackout effect just before the sector switch.
[2015/11/18 13:59:50] <Tobbi> But that adds a few seconds...
[2015/11/18 13:59:59] <Tobbi> Aka, people might be complaining about them not getting best stats.

[2015/11/18 14:02:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, you go up to a door, press up, then walk off?
[2015/11/18 14:02:53] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, basically, the screen fadeout starts once the door opens...we could make it so it starts later.
[2015/11/18 14:02:56] <Tobbi> And is shorter.
[2015/11/18 14:03:14] <brmbrmcar> That is good.
[2015/11/18 14:04:04] <Tobbi> but a lot of work, I believe.
[2015/11/18 14:04:04] <Karkus> You shouldn't be able to walk around once you've pressed up. You should freeze in place and a door entering animation should show
[2015/11/18 14:04:18] <Tobbi> Well, currently it just fades.
[2015/11/18 14:04:46] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but that is even worse.

[2015/11/19 09:16:23] <Tobbi> But since it's a release candidate, I am not sure if we should use it in the final release.

[2015/11/19 10:14:33] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/19 10:14:47] <maths22> The issue is that I have to merge the main repo into my fork
[2015/11/19 10:17:51] <grumbel> What are the near term plans for SuperTux? Is there a new release soon?
[2015/11/19 10:24:45] <Tobbi> grumbel: We plan on releasing milestone 2 next month. Probably on the 20th.
[2015/11/19 10:25:06] <Tobbi> MS 2 works stable enough so that a final release should be justified.
[2015/11/19 10:25:45] <grumbel> ok, then I'll wait with my lisp->sexp replacement till after that, as that might break a bit of stuff
[2015/11/19 10:25:58] <Tobbi> Okay, unless you can unbreak this easily. :P
[2015/11/19 10:26:20] <Tobbi> maths22: I suppose we should use Squirrel 3.0 stable instead of 3.1 release candidate? Or what do you think?
[2015/11/19 10:26:38] <Tobbi> I mean: Both is in the repository...
[2015/11/19 10:30:26] <maths22> Tobbi: I would say to stick with the stable release
[2015/11/19 10:30:31] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2015/11/19 10:30:54] <maths22> grumbel: What is this 'lisp->sexp replacement'?

[2015/11/19 10:33:13] <Tobbi> Did I do pull requests against those repos or did you just pull in my commits from supertux?

[2015/11/19 10:42:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: Uhm, grumbel has reworked the lisp parser quite a bit...but we likely won't make it until the release of 0.4.0...with testing and stuff...
[2015/11/19 10:43:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: By the way: Feature freeze already passed, right?
[2015/11/19 10:43:18] <Tobbi> When is string freeze?
[2015/11/19 10:44:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: String freeze?
[2015/11/19 10:44:25] <Tobbi> head8debian: You know, when you snatch a girl's underpants and put it in the fridge.
[2015/11/19 10:44:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: We are only a month from release... so we should not be incorperating really anything...
[2015/11/19 10:44:38] <head8debian> except bug fixes.
[2015/11/19 10:44:38] <Tobbi> Or rather freezer
[2015/11/19 10:44:44] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/19 10:44:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: String freeze is when the strings = all text is frozen.
[2015/11/19 10:45:05] <Tobbi> So that translators don't have to incorporate changes...
[2015/11/19 10:45:19] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/11/19 10:45:20] <Tobbi> But since we don't know where giby is...we shouldn't really be doing anything.
[2015/11/19 10:45:43] <Tobbi> head8debian: does makepot.sh work for you?
[2015/11/19 10:45:52] <Tobbi> From a non-Mac / non-Windows computer..
[2015/11/19 10:49:50] <maths22> Tobbi: I think my build changes should probably get integrated before release

[2015/11/19 10:50:03] <Tobbi> maths22: sure, thanks.
[2015/11/19 10:50:49] <Tobbi> head8debian: couldn't you postpone the logo issue? I am not sure whether we should change our logo at all, but who knows...
[2015/11/19 10:51:01] <Tobbi> maths22: Please do a pull request when you're ready.
[2015/11/19 10:51:07] <Tobbi> maths22: Also, what about the changes to the squirrel lib?
[2015/11/19 10:51:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: Anyone can re-open it if they want...
[2015/11/19 10:51:14] <Tobbi> Right!
[2015/11/19 10:51:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't like having stuff floating in my hair.
[2015/11/19 10:51:24] <maths22> Tobbi: What am I doing with squirrel?
[2015/11/19 10:51:25] <head8debian> ;)
[2015/11/19 10:51:41] <Tobbi> maths22: https://github.com/SuperTux/squirrel/pull/1 ?
[2015/11/19 10:51:46] <head8debian> Tobbi: makepot.sh?
[2015/11/19 10:52:06] <Tobbi> maths22: Also https://github.com/SuperTux/tinygettext/pull/1
[2015/11/19 10:52:17] <Tobbi> To be honest, I don't know anything about this...
[2015/11/19 10:52:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: makepot.sh should create localizations...
[2015/11/19 10:52:36] <maths22> Tobbi: I see what you are talking about
[2015/11/19 10:52:44] <maths22> I'm going to close those and open a new set
[2015/11/19 10:52:52] <Tobbi> okay, sounds good.
[2015/11/19 10:53:00] <maths22> It's just little changes mostly to make Windows happy
[2015/11/19 10:53:03] <Tobbi> As I said, I am not too familiar with CMake...
[2015/11/19 10:53:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, it doesn't have any rm -rf commands... and it finished properly... :-)
[2015/11/19 10:53:41] <head8debian> Not sure what it did...
[2015/11/19 10:53:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, so, because it didn't work on my mac.
[2015/11/19 10:53:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: Does git diff show you anything?

[2015/11/19 10:55:33] <Tobbi> Okay....
[2015/11/19 10:55:49] <Tobbi> not what I expected, anyway.
[2015/11/19 10:56:12] <head8debian> Does anything ever come out the way we expect? :p
[2015/11/19 10:56:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: Not with this project, no.
[2015/11/19 10:57:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't think its just us...
[2015/11/19 10:58:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Now, if you copy one of the add-on levelsets (the actual directory, not the zip) to data/levels, then run that command again?
[2015/11/19 11:04:02] <Tobbi> Aha!
[2015/11/19 11:04:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: I fixed it!
[2015/11/19 11:04:45] <Tobbi> It uses strange line endings that were converted.
[2015/11/19 11:09:48] <Tobbi> Oh, it created a pot file.
[2015/11/19 11:09:53] <Tobbi> Not sure what that does.
[2015/11/19 11:09:53] <maths22> Tobbi: Windows and OS X are up to date here: http://brlcad.org/~maths22/supertux-download.php
[2015/11/19 11:10:08] <maths22> Linux is building and will be up to date at some point
[2015/11/19 11:10:22] <Tobbi> maths22: Except that "The requested URL /usr/web/brlcad.org/builds/SUPERTUX-0.4.0-GIT-Darwin.dmg was not found on this server." ;)
[2015/11/19 11:10:52] <maths22> Tobbi: fixing...
[2015/11/19 11:10:57] <Tobbi> :-)
[2015/11/19 11:12:15] <Tobbi> I should actually change the URL in the topic.
[2015/11/19 11:12:29] @ Tobbi set topic "Welcome to the SuperTux chat | https://github.com/SuperTux | Stable: 0.1.3 | Beta: 0.3.5a | Travis: https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux | mailing list: supertux-devel@lists.lethargik.org | ©häññèł łôǥ http://sydneyjd.github.io/logs/ | nightly builds http://brlcad.org/~maths22/supertux-download.php"

[2015/11/19 11:13:59] <Tobbi> Thanks, looks good.
[2015/11/19 11:14:26] <Tobbi> maths22: Would it be possible for you to display the commit hash of the file and the build date on that site?
[2015/11/19 11:14:40] <Tobbi> eeh, by commit hash I mean the HEAD commit SHA...
[2015/11/19 11:15:23] <maths22> Tobbi: That will be added
[2015/11/19 11:15:34] <Tobbi> Great.
[2015/11/19 11:15:48] <maths22> Tobbi: Is it OK if I change cmake version numbers to use git describe?
[2015/11/19 11:15:49] <Tobbi> maths22: By the way: Shall I add you to the credits before the release?
[2015/11/19 11:15:54] <Tobbi> maths22: Yes, sure.
[2015/11/19 11:16:10] <maths22> Tobbi: Sure on the credits
[2015/11/19 11:16:20] <maths22> Do you have my real name?
[2015/11/19 11:16:36] <Tobbi> maths22: I don't. Actually you can submit a PR for credits.txt and I will merge that :)

[2015/11/19 11:33:19] <brmbrmcar> Why is it 'nightly'?
[2015/11/19 11:33:52] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: It builds supertux every night or pretty close to that.
[2015/11/19 11:34:18] <brmbrmcar> So, what about my error when trying to install a nightly build?
[2015/11/19 11:36:42] <Tobbi> maths22: There's something weird going on: The nightly build for Mac crashes (for some reason). Also the executable is only 276 bytes in size.
[2015/11/19 11:36:51] <Tobbi> So, there might have been a problem with loading the file
[2015/11/19 11:37:24] <brmbrmcar> All the nightly builds are throwing up errors.
[2015/11/19 11:38:05] <Tobbi> Maybe not all of them.
[2015/11/19 11:38:23] <brmbrmcar> Well, everything I've tried.
[2015/11/19 11:38:40] <brmbrmcar> Wine, maybe? I'll test it.
[2015/11/19 11:39:44] <head8debian> I will give the windows one a try later.
[2015/11/19 11:41:25] <brmbrmcar> In the Windows build, not executable file is generated.
[2015/11/19 11:41:41] <brmbrmcar> Youjust get the uninstall.exe
[2015/11/19 11:42:18] <brmbrmcar> The package is so crazy!
[2015/11/19 11:42:57] <maths22> Clearly something failed.
[2015/11/19 11:42:59] <maths22> I will fix that
[2015/11/19 11:43:37] <Tobbi> But this release will be great.
[2015/11/19 11:43:39] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/11/19 11:43:46] <head8debian> Yes it will. :-)
[2015/11/19 11:43:47] <brmbrmcar> December 20?
[2015/11/19 11:44:02] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: We have no dates set currently...
[2015/11/19 11:44:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: What day does the christmas code kick in again?
[2015/11/19 11:44:33] <brmbrmcar> 6th
[2015/11/19 11:44:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: Gosh, I don't know. Calculate it. :D
[2015/11/19 11:45:08] <Tobbi> Yes, the 6th
[2015/11/19 11:45:16] <brmbrmcar> Yay!
[2015/11/19 11:45:21] <Tobbi> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/68bdf113c9cf702f206d3ce078a4c09340bb8ce1/src/supertux/gameconfig.hpp
[2015/11/19 11:46:39] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Were you able to get a screenshot for https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/227 ?
[2015/11/19 11:47:05] <brmbrmcar> Hang on...
[2015/11/19 11:48:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: Could we release on maybe the 10th?
[2015/11/19 11:48:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: I guess whenever we feel like it. :-)
[2015/11/19 11:48:45] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: It is very hard to capture, as it is only there for a very small amount of time.
[2015/11/19 11:50:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, this should be set in advance.
[2015/11/19 11:51:03] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So you're saying that the game freezes loading the game assets etc.?
[2015/11/19 11:51:07] <Tobbi> But works afterwards?
[2015/11/19 11:51:29] <brmbrmcar> Ah, for that.
[2015/11/19 11:52:13] <brmbrmcar> It shows afterwards, but the screen updates around every 5 seconds
[2015/11/19 11:52:21] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/19 11:52:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: Good idea... Sometime in december...
[2015/11/19 11:52:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: That was irony, wasn't it?
[2015/11/19 11:53:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: I believe the 10th is a bit too early...didn't we set for the 20th?
[2015/11/19 11:53:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: I belive we did.
[2015/11/19 11:53:30] <Tobbi> That's a sunday, so should work fine.
[2015/11/19 11:53:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its a decent time. ;) Right before Christmas. :-)
[2015/11/19 11:53:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: Definitely.
[2015/11/19 11:53:55] <brmbrmcar> Why does the day of the week matter?
[2015/11/19 11:54:06] <Tobbi> Also 0.3.0 or something was released on the 20th as well.
[2015/11/19 11:54:12] <head8debian> Deck the website with boughs of holly, lalalalala lalalala. :p
[2015/11/19 11:54:14] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Because release dates tend to be tressful.
[2015/11/19 11:54:24] <head8debian> haha.
[2015/11/19 11:54:26] <head8debian> True.
[2015/11/19 11:54:27] <Tobbi> *stressful
[2015/11/19 11:54:44] <brmbrmcar> You like Sunday stress!
[2015/11/19 11:54:52] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I have college during the weekdays...
[2015/11/19 11:55:18] <head8debian> I have school.
[2015/11/19 11:55:40] <Tobbi> We should *actually* see if we can fetch available langpacks for people on startup.
[2015/11/19 11:55:54] <Tobbi> and / or when switching languages.
[2015/11/19 11:56:05] <Tobbi> That should be done before the release.
[2015/11/19 11:56:08] <Tobbi> LMH told me about it.
[2015/11/19 11:57:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok. Well, just so long as everything is "still" stable.
[2015/11/19 11:58:03] <head8debian> Im shocked that we are so close to release...
[2015/11/19 11:58:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: Maybe I won't do it.
[2015/11/19 11:58:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: Sure, but the release date was planned way in advance, right?
[2015/11/19 11:58:28] <Tobbi> didn't we?
[2015/11/19 11:58:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes.
[2015/11/19 11:59:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its just coming up so fast.
[2015/11/19 11:59:18] <Tobbi> Right...
[2015/11/19 11:59:33] <Tobbi> head8debian: But this release is great... Lots of stuff added and finished etc.
[2015/11/19 12:00:20] <brmbrmcar> Nice and stable. No Windows or OSX computers will blow up because of us.
[2015/11/19 12:00:29] <Tobbi> Yes, and that.
[2015/11/19 12:00:33] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/11/19 12:03:07] <brmbrmcar> Supertux will be released in 31 days.
[2015/11/19 12:03:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: http://lwn.net/Articles/250967/ :D
[2015/11/19 12:03:22] <head8debian> Perfect article for you. :D
[2015/11/19 12:03:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: Not right now.
[2015/11/19 12:03:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am a little concerned whether giby will show up...Because he hasn't...
[2015/11/19 12:04:05] <Tobbi> We need up-to-date localizations.
[2015/11/19 12:04:23] <brmbrmcar> head8debian:Why is Tux wearing glasses?
[2015/11/19 12:04:41] <brmbrmcar> They are blue!
[2015/11/19 12:05:32] <head8debian> ~seen giby
[2015/11/19 12:05:32] <red_bot> head8debian: giby was last seen 12 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 33 seconds ago, quitting IRC (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[2015/11/19 12:05:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: :-/
[2015/11/19 12:05:51] <Tobbi> Yes, precisely...
[2015/11/19 12:06:55] <brmbrmcar> \-:
[2015/11/19 12:07:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, he has one month to appear... If not... :-/
[2015/11/19 12:07:14] <brmbrmcar> And what are the odds?
[2015/11/19 12:07:17] <Tobbi> head8debian: He needs to update translations, and the translators need to translate those.
[2015/11/19 12:07:21] <Tobbi> There are strings...
[2015/11/19 12:07:32] <Tobbi> That are not on transifex yet, I mean.
[2015/11/19 12:08:35] <Tobbi> And I don't have the know-how...
[2015/11/19 12:09:06] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Uhm, 10:1 that he *will* show up.
[2015/11/19 12:09:15] <head8debian> he will show up...
[2015/11/19 12:09:21] <brmbrmcar> I don't gamble.
[2015/11/19 12:09:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: But what if he doesn't appear before the release?
[2015/11/19 12:09:40] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: neither do i.
[2015/11/19 12:09:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: Then we will ship with untranslated strings.
[2015/11/19 12:09:51] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's not a big deal...
[2015/11/19 12:10:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Oh. Well you made it sound like a big deal. :-)
[2015/11/19 12:10:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: Hmm, it would just be great, if...
[2015/11/19 12:10:39] <Tobbi> well, never mind.
[2015/11/19 12:10:56] <brmbrmcar> So an incomplete 0.4.0.
[2015/11/19 12:11:46] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes... i understand.

[2015/11/19 12:26:18] <Tobbi> Looks like the krush is not going down.
[2015/11/19 12:26:21] <Tobbi> but stuck in the wall...
[2015/11/19 12:26:23] <Tobbi> hey Hume2
[2015/11/19 12:27:06] <Hume2> Hi Tobbi. In which level does it happen?
[2015/11/19 12:27:40] <Tobbi> Hume2: one moment.
[2015/11/19 12:27:44] <brmbrmcar> Long Haul
[2015/11/19 12:27:52] <Tobbi> yes, don't know the filename, though.

[2015/11/19 12:28:48] <Tobbi> Hume2: Not that I know of, I believe it's in CT. dabomb's level sets.
[2015/11/19 12:29:36] <brmbrmcar> Console isn't giving any clues to the filename.
[2015/11/19 12:30:05] <brmbrmcar> for-haul.st;
[2015/11/19 12:30:12] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/19 12:30:14] <Tobbi> Exactly.
[2015/11/19 12:30:15] <Tobbi> for-haul.stl
[2015/11/19 12:31:10] <brmbrmcar> Have the deliberately covered the level with white?
[2015/11/19 12:32:39] <Tobbi> covered the level with white?
[2015/11/19 12:32:48] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/19 12:33:01] <brmbrmcar> You can't erase the stuff onthe second sector.
[2015/11/19 12:33:24] <Tobbi> Aha.
[2015/11/19 12:33:25] <Tobbi> Not sure.
[2015/11/19 12:33:55] <brmbrmcar> Why would they do it though?
[2015/11/19 12:33:59] <Hume2> Well, in my opinion, the icecrusher are wrongly placed, because one of them is in a wall.

[2015/11/19 12:37:42] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yes, that's true.
[2015/11/19 12:37:50] <Tobbi> Not sure if it's worth fixing, then.
[2015/11/19 12:38:28] <Hume2> I've once fixed one icecrusher related bug, related to the same level.
[2015/11/19 12:38:42] <brmbrmcar> Oh yes.
[2015/11/19 12:38:44] <Hume2> So choose which bug do you like more.
[2015/11/19 12:38:58] <Tobbi> Yes, it's fine the way it is.

[2015/11/19 12:41:06] <Hume2> It worked before, but I fixed that bug I hope.
[2015/11/19 12:41:13] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/19 12:41:23] <brmbrmcar> Have you tried it?
[2015/11/19 12:42:10] <Hume2> Previously it worked with any platform moving up and a wall that is 32px high.
[2015/11/19 12:42:17] <maths22> Tobbi: By the way, the linux builds appear to work correctly, so the issue is limited to the OS X and Windows builds
[2015/11/19 12:42:27] <Tobbi> Okay?
[2015/11/19 12:42:39] <Tobbi> That's weird.
[2015/11/19 12:42:46] <brmbrmcar> Ihad a bug with the Ubuntu one earlier today.
[2015/11/19 12:42:58] <brmbrmcar> It couldn't get the public key.
[2015/11/19 12:44:16] <brmbrmcar> And all the Windows build does is unpackage itself.
[2015/11/19 12:44:25] <brmbrmcar> And create uninstall.exe!
[2015/11/19 12:45:05] <Tobbi> We should assemble a list of things to do for the release.
[2015/11/19 12:45:16] <Tobbi> I mean: Update website, update wiki etc.
[2015/11/19 12:45:27] <brmbrmcar> Create working builds

[2015/11/19 12:48:52] <brmbrmcar> How long will it take for the packages to be in the repos then?
[2015/11/19 12:49:09] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Actually, the windows build mostly works, but it may not do working shortcuts
[2015/11/19 12:49:16] <maths22> It also is missing 2 dlls
[2015/11/19 12:49:37] <brmbrmcar> maths22: I see no supertux.exe or anything similar in there.
[2015/11/19 12:49:39] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I will test Ubuntu later today
[2015/11/19 12:49:43] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It is in the bin directory
[2015/11/19 12:50:24] <brmbrmcar> It won't start up.
[2015/11/19 12:50:26] <maths22> Also, what issue did you have with the key
[2015/11/19 12:50:27] <Hume2> Should be Tux able to unduck in tiny passages and then get hurt?
[2015/11/19 12:50:31] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I know it won't start
[2015/11/19 12:50:35] <maths22> I'm fixing that later today
[2015/11/19 12:50:41] <brmbrmcar> To be fair,I am using Wine.
[2015/11/19 12:50:50] <maths22> brmbrmcar: So am I, actually
[2015/11/19 12:50:54] <maths22> I should test on real windows
[2015/11/19 12:51:12] <Hume2> Windows is a virus.
[2015/11/19 12:51:14] <maths22> (I have real windows, but that means I have to restart my computer)
[2015/11/19 12:52:21] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It is missing LIBEAY32.dll and SSLEAY32.dll
[2015/11/19 12:52:29] <maths22> I will take care of them
[2015/11/19 12:52:33] <brmbrmcar> maths22: OK, thanks.
[2015/11/19 12:52:56] <maths22> Tobbi: what is specifically broken in the OS X build?
[2015/11/19 12:53:52] <Tobbi> maths22: The executable isn't built correctly, afaict.
[2015/11/19 12:54:15] <Tobbi> Hume2: Unducking and getting hurt is intended behaviour.
[2015/11/19 12:55:08] <Hume2> It's not much real, but well then.
[2015/11/19 12:55:50] <Tobbi> maths22: So, on my system, supertux2 has a size of 6.8 MB
[2015/11/19 12:55:58] <brmbrmcar> Tux should be sent back out the way bhe came!
[2015/11/19 12:56:27] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: This was removed because of the glitch it caused.
[2015/11/19 12:56:28] <maths22> Tobbi: I'll take a look this afternoon (when I get access to a Mac)
[2015/11/19 12:57:06] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I'd like to see a way of walking when ducked, but that's for Milestone 3.
[2015/11/19 12:57:14] <Tobbi> Sure, thanks.
[2015/11/19 12:57:41] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: It was like that in 0.1.3
[2015/11/19 12:58:01] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes. Do you know that glitch?
[2015/11/19 13:00:31] <Hume2> About 10% of TeraTux levels were based on that glitch.

[2015/11/19 14:31:51] @ onpon4 joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/19 14:33:21] <onpon4> Just want to point this out, in case anyone working on SuperTux's graphics is interested: http://opengameart.org/forumtopic/retux-graphical-improvements
[2015/11/19 14:34:04] <Karkus> onpon4: Did you use any code from SuperTux?
[2015/11/19 14:34:14] <onpon4> Karkus: No.
[2015/11/19 14:34:34] <Karkus> onpon4: What about graphics?
[2015/11/19 14:34:43] <onpon4> I've mentioned ReTux before; it's a different game, but using SuperTux's graphics, sounds, and music.
[2015/11/19 14:35:14] <onpon4> Actually, there are a couple graphics and a couple sounds added from other sources too, but it's basically using SuperTux's art assets.
[2015/11/19 14:35:45] <onpon4> Anyway, those improvements I'm looking for would benefit SuperTux just as much as ReTux. :)
[2015/11/19 14:36:08] <onpon4> Or, at least, some of them would. Not sure about the last three.
[2015/11/19 14:36:14] <brmbrmcar> Is reTux even legal? It could be classed as commercial,as it in theory costs money.
[2015/11/19 14:36:17] <Karkus> Oh, okay. Have you checked all the licenses and that out to make sure you aren't doing anything wrong? In the end, those assets aren't yours.
[2015/11/19 14:36:35] <onpon4> brmbrmcar: Yes, it's commercial. The GNU GPL allows commercial use.
[2015/11/19 14:36:38] <Karkus> brmrbrmcar: It depends on the assets
[2015/11/19 14:37:11] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/19 14:37:18] <Karkus> onpon4: I don't think the graphics are under GPL. I might be wrong
[2015/11/19 14:37:26] <maths22> I have tried to work this through before, but basically the GPL is not very relevant to graphics/data assets
[2015/11/19 14:37:39] <maths22> This is why we use a CC-BY-SA license
[2015/11/19 14:37:48] <onpon4> That they're under the GNU GPL is the consensus I got when I asked previously.
[2015/11/19 14:37:50] <Karkus> maths22: Thought so
[2015/11/19 14:37:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats that mean? o_O
[2015/11/19 14:38:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: Unit test = tests for a couple of functions.
[2015/11/19 14:38:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, i *could* work on the filenames for the forest world if i knew how.
[2015/11/19 14:38:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Just rename the files and update worldmap.stwm
[2015/11/19 14:38:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: Oh. So they match in-game?
[2015/11/19 14:38:51] <Karkus> onpon4: Well it seems they aren't
[2015/11/19 14:38:53] <head8debian> in-game filenames*
[2015/11/19 14:38:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh? We are only talking about the filenames...
[2015/11/19 14:39:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: What do you mean by that_
[2015/11/19 14:39:08] <onpon4> Also here: http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=68&t=6631&sid=d4a94fecbf89f594e6e4128d8fd11227#p66510
[2015/11/19 14:39:08] <Tobbi> By "in game filenames"?
[2015/11/19 14:39:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: Do i need to rename the actual physical filename of the game file, or what the name of the level appears to be in the game?
[2015/11/19 14:39:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: What license are the assets under?
[2015/11/19 14:40:00] <head8debian> I don't know how to put it simpler than that.
[2015/11/19 14:40:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: Rename the .stl file and change the reference in the stwm file.
[2015/11/19 14:40:25] <Tobbi> makes sense?
[2015/11/19 14:40:34] <onpon4> But if it's true that SuperTux's graphics are not under the GNU GPL, then they are *proprietary*, because no file indicates any other license. And that would make SuperTux unfit for inclusion in Debian, meaning you have to replace *all* the graphics.
[2015/11/19 14:40:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's a good question... I'd say they are under the GPL...
[2015/11/19 14:40:50] <onpon4> I don't think that's the case.
[2015/11/19 14:41:02] <Tobbi> I don't have other information, but let me look.
[2015/11/19 14:41:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes.
[2015/11/19 14:41:51] <Karkus> onpon4: Proprietary != not GPL though
[2015/11/19 14:42:47] <Karkus> onpon4: I thought proprietary was a code term anyway
[2015/11/19 14:42:56] <onpon4> Karkus: If no license is specified, proprietary is the default. The only possible license I see that can apply to SuperTux's graphics is the GNU GPL, and it looks to me like that was the intention of the artists.
[2015/11/19 14:43:14] <onpon4> Karkus: Culture can be libre or proprietary, too.
[2015/11/19 14:43:46] <Karkus> Hmm I guess it can
[2015/11/19 14:43:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: Only thing I can find is https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/AUTHORS
[2015/11/19 14:44:48] <maths22> onpon4: They are some combination of GPL and CC-BY-SA

[2015/11/19 14:51:31] <maths22> Unfourtniately, nothing actually says that for the graphics assets
[2015/11/19 14:51:50] <maths22> Therefore, they are technically only GPL (unless I find an old LICENSE file)
[2015/11/19 14:52:46] <brmbrmcar> So...
[2015/11/19 14:53:08] <Karkus> onpon4: What license is ReTux under?
[2015/11/19 14:53:17] <maths22> The real issue is just that the GPL applies rather poorly to assets
[2015/11/19 14:53:22] <onpon4> Karkus: The code is under the GNU GPL.
[2015/11/19 14:53:48] <onpon4> As are all the rest of the things I made from scratch (like levels).
[2015/11/19 14:53:52] <brmbrmcar> How does that work?
[2015/11/19 14:53:59] <Karkus> onpon4: So if a person bought the game, you'd show them the code?
[2015/11/19 14:54:19] <onpon4> Karkus: Of course. The backers already have the source code. One of them has even published it.
[2015/11/19 14:54:48] <Tobbi> onpon4: But that means the code can actually live on github, for example, can't it?
[2015/11/19 14:54:58] <onpon4> Tobbi: If someone else puts it there, sure.
[2015/11/19 14:55:13] <Tobbi> onpon4: Why not put it there yourself?

[2015/11/19 14:55:22] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/19 14:55:40] <Tobbi> After all, you use our assets, so we could expect that small favour from you in return :P

[2015/11/19 14:56:13] <onpon4> Tobbi: You are more than welcome to use ReTux's engine if you want. :)
[2015/11/19 14:56:36] <Tobbi> I just want to take a look at the code, that's all.
[2015/11/19 14:56:38] <Tobbi> Not use it.
[2015/11/19 14:56:47] <Karkus> Me too
[2015/11/19 14:57:29] <onpon4> Eh, I guess I could give you a gratis copy, too.
[2015/11/19 14:58:05] <onpon4> Actually, on that note, I gave a gratis copy of ReTux to the woman who did the run animation. Probably will do the same for anyone who does any of those improvements.
[2015/11/19 14:58:36] <Tobbi> Actually, that run animation should get integrated.
[2015/11/19 14:58:43] <Tobbi> Not sure if we can make it before the release, probably not.
[2015/11/19 14:58:50] <Tobbi> But for after 0.4, this might be great.
[2015/11/19 14:58:58] <Karkus> onpon4: We have our own project, if you haven't noticed -_-
[2015/11/19 15:00:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have been thinking: Maybe we can get this guy here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOeP9tztDl0 to update his level set for MS 2.
[2015/11/19 15:01:39] <Tobbi> Plus, he's available an replies to requests, see the top comment.
[2015/11/19 15:03:34] <Karkus> Tobbi: So we could maybe convince him to join us on GitHub?
[2015/11/19 15:04:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yup. I believe, he'd need to adjust the license of the add-on as well, and let's hope he doesn't have any non-free assets in there.
[2015/11/19 15:04:10] <Tobbi> Otherwise, same problem we already had.
[2015/11/19 15:04:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in music???
[2015/11/19 15:04:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: Precisely...or background images...
[2015/11/19 15:04:31] <Karkus> Lots of non-free assets where that's concerned
[2015/11/19 15:04:32] <Tobbi> He's using custom background images.
[2015/11/19 15:04:57] <grumbel> shouldn't be to hard to repaint them if needed
[2015/11/19 15:05:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: The worldmap music is non-free, maybe others
[2015/11/19 15:05:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: How do you know?
[2015/11/19 15:05:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: I recognise it
[2015/11/19 15:05:55] <Tobbi> grumbel: For example that picture of the beach with palm tree?
[2015/11/19 15:06:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: I see...so maybe not such a good idea...But doesn't hurt to try.
[2015/11/19 15:06:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's not hard to change.
[2015/11/19 15:06:24] <Tobbi> Right
[2015/11/19 15:19:06] @ Quit: grumbel: Quit: Ex-Chat
[2015/11/19 15:20:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: I
[2015/11/19 15:20:09] <Tobbi> ve been thinking.
[2015/11/19 15:20:12] <Tobbi> Sorry.
[2015/11/19 15:20:13] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 15:20:16] <Karkus> :P
[2015/11/19 15:20:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's a first then
[2015/11/19 15:20:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I believe if we pass a directory to ./supertux2 instead of a level or worldmap file, it should create a level set out of the levels in that directory.
[2015/11/19 15:20:41] <Tobbi> At least IMO
[2015/11/19 15:20:54] <Tobbi> And display a listing, I mean.
[2015/11/19 15:21:04] <Karkus> Oh, okay
[2015/11/19 15:21:12] <Tobbi> Not sure how hard that would be.
[2015/11/19 15:21:23] <Karkus> Shouldn't be toooooo hard
[2015/11/19 15:21:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: I
[2015/11/19 15:21:31] <Karkus> ve been thinking
[2015/11/19 15:21:31] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 15:21:36] <Karkus> :D
[2015/11/19 15:21:39] <Karkus> too
[2015/11/19 15:21:40] <Tobbi> damn. stop.
[2015/11/19 15:22:25] <Karkus> I've been thinking about Tinygettext thing
[2015/11/19 15:22:32] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2015/11/19 15:22:35] <Tobbi> And?
[2015/11/19 15:22:49] <Karkus> Just a moment
[2015/11/19 15:26:23] <Karkus> When disabled, we just need to set it to disabled and then stop Tinygettext checking there. So we don't necessarily need to unload it. Does that make sense or am I wrong?
[2015/11/19 15:26:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: The thing is: The strings get added to a global dictionary...
[2015/11/19 15:26:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: I know
[2015/11/19 15:26:54] <Tobbi> Karkus: Problem is letting the GUI reload the strings...aka calling _("my string") on the strings again.
[2015/11/19 15:28:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: But, unlike the language menu, we don't want to reset to Main Menu
[2015/11/19 15:28:09] <Karkus> I see.
[2015/11/19 15:28:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: Even if we reset to MainMenu, it still doesn't work properly. I tried that, I believe.
[2015/11/19 15:28:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: Did you work out why?
[2015/11/19 15:29:03] <Karkus> I would expect it to work
[2015/11/19 15:29:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: Nope, sorry.
[2015/11/19 15:29:12] <Tobbi> Karkus: You can try it, if you want.
[2015/11/19 15:29:23] <Karkus> Okay, I will try
[2015/11/19 15:31:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: I see you squished the language pack menu in with the addon menu :)
[2015/11/19 15:32:00] <Tobbi> Karkus: yup, LMH also provided something...
[2015/11/19 15:32:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: Problem is that langpacks have to be installed separately, so if people don't get that they have to install them, they'll get untranslated strings.
[2015/11/19 15:32:32] <Tobbi> But I can live with that for now.
[2015/11/19 15:33:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: Was there a reason they had to be separate rather than downloaded with the addons?
[2015/11/19 15:34:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: Behind the scenes, they are add-ons. What I mean is: When switching languages, they are not installed automatically.
[2015/11/19 15:34:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: All languages are addons?
[2015/11/19 15:34:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: Only strings for contrib levels are in add-ons.
[2015/11/19 15:35:00] <Tobbi> Does that make sense?
[2015/11/19 15:35:04] <Karkus> Yes
[2015/11/19 15:35:39] <Karkus> So, why not look within the addon .zip file for other (language pack) addons, and install them alongside?
[2015/11/19 15:35:50] <Karkus> Therefore, no disabling at all
[2015/11/19 15:36:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: ?^
[2015/11/19 15:37:08] <Tobbi> Uhm?
[2015/11/19 15:37:25] <Karkus> You don't understand?
[2015/11/19 15:37:27] <Tobbi> Nope.
[2015/11/19 15:38:49] <Karkus> Okay, let's say I made a world map, and package it into a .zip called kark.zip. I upload it to the supertux addons repo. Then, I add some German translations to the kark.zip. The game would automatically load this when people installed the addons
[2015/11/19 15:39:14] <Karkus> s/the addons/the kark.zip addon/
[2015/11/19 15:39:14] <red_bot> Karkus meant: "Okay, let's say I made a world map, and package it into a .zip called kark.zip. I upload it to the supertux addons repo. Then, I add some German translations to the kark.zip. The game would automatically load this when people installed the kark.zip addon"
[2015/11/19 15:40:39] <Karkus> The game would fetch translations, if possible, from kark.zip *during install of that addon*
[2015/11/19 15:41:23] <Karkus> Tobbi: Understand now?
[2015/11/19 15:41:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's true.
[2015/11/19 15:41:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: And it's possible as well...
[2015/11/19 15:41:36] <Tobbi> But updating is a pain...
[2015/11/19 15:41:47] <Tobbi> Basically you'd update the zip file whenever translations change.
[2015/11/19 15:42:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: You'd update the lang pack anyway
[2015/11/19 15:42:09] <Tobbi> I know...
[2015/11/19 15:42:17] <Tobbi> Karkus: But, LMH requested it that way...
[2015/11/19 15:42:22] <Tobbi> To have langpacks...
[2015/11/19 15:42:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hmm.
[2015/11/19 15:44:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: Since there's a disagreement, for 0.4.0 we'll leave it how it is. Now let me try resetting to main menu...
[2015/11/19 15:44:23] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/11/19 15:45:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: I mean: Both is possible. Localizations can be included in the addon's zip file or in a specific langpack add-on...
[2015/11/19 15:45:12] <Tobbi> Just a matter of what we actually do.
[2015/11/19 15:45:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh. I didn't know that already worked...
[2015/11/19 15:46:02] <Tobbi> I think I fixed that a while ago.
[2015/11/19 15:46:04] <Tobbi> let me check

[2015/11/19 15:54:55] @ tux|dude joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/19 15:55:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: Currently, are the translations being removed when the addon is disabled? Or just not loaded on startup?
[2015/11/19 15:56:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: If an add-on is disabled, the cache gets invalidated which triggers tinygettext to fetch the latest translation upon calling _("some string")
[2015/11/19 15:56:41] <Tobbi> I *believe* the problem is that this never happens, though...that _() is called again.
[2015/11/19 15:57:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: So, something to do with Tinygettext?
[2015/11/19 15:57:02] <Tobbi> "_" is the name of the translation function.
[2015/11/19 15:57:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am not sure...possibly something to do with how we load strings.
[2015/11/19 15:57:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah, I've seen this before
[2015/11/19 15:58:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: How does invalidating the cache work?

[2015/11/19 16:02:51] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, but only once, right? I mean: only after loading a screen...
[2015/11/19 16:03:00] <Karkus> Hmmm...
[2015/11/19 16:03:05] <Karkus> Loading which screen
[2015/11/19 16:03:37] <Karkus> I've been testing with the level names of the Halloween levels.

[2015/11/19 16:04:50] <Tobbi> I am not sure when its _() gets called.
[2015/11/19 16:05:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, so the level names work fine?
[2015/11/19 16:05:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: Most of the time...
[2015/11/19 16:05:38] <Tobbi> Let me check.
[2015/11/19 16:05:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why would the addon name change???
[2015/11/19 16:06:03] * Karkus is more confused
[2015/11/19 16:06:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, the level names don't work fine, either.
[2015/11/19 16:06:26] <Tobbi> I just disabled the langpack, and it still shows in german.
[2015/11/19 16:06:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: The add-on label, rather...
[2015/11/19 16:06:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah...
[2015/11/19 16:06:38] <Tobbi> Which gets displayed in the contrib levels...
[2015/11/19 16:06:43] <Tobbi> Sorry...
[2015/11/19 16:06:56] <Tobbi> It's quite confusing everything :P
[2015/11/19 16:07:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: Agreed
[2015/11/19 16:07:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, I understand that problem with the label
[2015/11/19 16:08:02] <Tobbi> oh?
[2015/11/19 16:08:30] <Tobbi> Ah, understand probably != know how to fix it...
[2015/11/19 16:08:31] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/19 16:08:36] <Karkus> Yeah...
[2015/11/19 16:09:01] <Karkus> I meant I know what you meant
[2015/11/19 16:09:18] <Tobbi> okay...
[2015/11/19 16:09:43] <Tobbi> I have a feeling this will require a major architecture change.
[2015/11/19 16:09:56] <Tobbi> Because we can't get the labels to update unless we reload their strings.

[2015/11/19 16:11:20] <brmbrmcar> He wants money.
[2015/11/19 16:11:25] <Tobbi> He has that right...
[2015/11/19 16:11:30] <Karkus> Yeah...

[2015/11/19 16:12:02] <Tobbi> But still...he's using our files...so the least he can do is publish his code somewhere or something.

[2015/11/19 16:12:31] <Karkus> I feel (for the original developers), cheated. He's trying to make money out of their ideas, work, and graphics

[2015/11/19 16:23:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: And that's the video that taught me. Now to learn it again
[2015/11/19 16:23:58] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/19 16:25:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Did you know the two people who've managed to win the million pounds both turned it down?
[2015/11/19 16:25:28] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know one of them...The guy who went to live in the rainforest(?)
[2015/11/19 16:25:33] <Tobbi> Let me check.
[2015/11/19 16:25:39] <Karkus> 'know'?
[2015/11/19 16:25:50] <Tobbi> Grigori Perelman
[2015/11/19 16:25:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: I mean: I knew the name.
[2015/11/19 16:26:03] <Tobbi> Or heard of that guy.
[2015/11/19 16:26:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/19 16:26:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: maybe it's only one that's been completed...
[2015/11/19 16:26:57] <Karkus> Let me check
[2015/11/19 16:26:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: Did you get anywhere with ducky levels?
[2015/11/19 16:27:03] <head8debian> ;p
[2015/11/19 16:27:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: ducky levels?
[2015/11/19 16:27:44] <Karkus> Tobbi: I was wrong. Only one has been done.
[2015/11/19 16:27:51] <Tobbi> Ah, okay...
[2015/11/19 16:29:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: I wished numberphile would explain more of the millennium problems...
[2015/11/19 16:29:13] <Tobbi> Maybe I should write them again.
[2015/11/19 16:29:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: Just in case the answer pops into your head?
[2015/11/19 16:29:23] <Tobbi> Actually, maybe the others are not that easily explainable...
[2015/11/19 16:29:28] <Karkus> Probably
[2015/11/19 16:29:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's interesting to think about that stuff.
[2015/11/19 16:29:34] <Karkus> and not maths related
[2015/11/19 16:29:40] <Karkus> very
[2015/11/19 16:29:42] <Karkus> idk
[2015/11/19 16:29:47] <Karkus> some are about physics
[2015/11/19 16:29:50] <Tobbi> oh...ok
[2015/11/19 16:30:15] <Karkus> P = NP for example, was probably explained on Computerphile
[2015/11/19 16:30:33] <head8debian> Tobbi: rubberduck...
[2015/11/19 16:30:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh, no, I didn't take a look at them...
[2015/11/19 16:31:13] <Tobbi> Wait, I did...
[2015/11/19 16:31:14] <Tobbi> long ago.
[2015/11/19 16:31:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Screenshot, please?
[2015/11/19 16:31:55] <head8debian> Im busy...
[2015/11/19 16:32:36] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 16:34:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Where are the visable names for the levels in game chosen?
[2015/11/19 16:34:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: In the worldmap.stwm file, I believe.
[2015/11/19 16:34:43] <Tobbi> No, wait.
[2015/11/19 16:34:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: They are defined in the levels themselves.
[2015/11/19 16:35:00] <Tobbi> so in the stl file.
[2015/11/19 16:37:04] <head8debian> I see.

[2015/11/19 16:48:33] <Tobbi> I mean: The source strings.
[2015/11/19 16:50:10] <Tobbi> So, these are templates, most likely.

[2015/11/19 16:55:54] <Tobbi> I might have figured out how to use that.
[2015/11/19 16:57:19] <Tobbi> I'll have to create a new translation file, though.
[2015/11/19 16:59:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: It seems there are some more levels in /world2 than we are using...
[2015/11/19 16:59:23] <Tobbi> Yup...
[2015/11/19 16:59:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Should we?
[2015/11/19 17:00:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh? What?
[2015/11/19 17:00:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Should we add these odd levels to the worldmap?
[2015/11/19 17:01:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: Which ones are they?
[2015/11/19 17:03:18] <head8debian> castle, christophD,forest1-grumbel,Mtn Pass, village.
[2015/11/19 17:03:28] <head8debian> I think there is one more, but anyways.
[2015/11/19 17:04:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: There must be a reason they are left out though.
[2015/11/19 17:04:50] <head8debian> Im done renaming.
[2015/11/19 17:04:54] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/19 17:05:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Good, pull request please.
[2015/11/19 17:05:00] <head8debian> Now if someone would be willing to test.
[2015/11/19 17:10:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, so i have one additional file that i accedentally "git add"ed. How do i un-git-add it?
[2015/11/19 17:10:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: one moment, please.
[2015/11/19 17:15:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: o_O
[2015/11/19 17:15:38] <head8debian> I should have picked these files one by one if i knew it was going to take this long.
[2015/11/19 17:16:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ah! Got it.
[2015/11/19 17:18:19] <head8debian> Uh oh... where is my worldmap!?

[2015/11/19 18:18:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: urgh.
[2015/11/19 18:19:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: I feel the same way. ;)
[2015/11/19 18:19:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: On a related note: I set up automatic-pulling translations from the git repository from transifex.
[2015/11/19 18:19:50] <Tobbi> If it doesn't work, we're all screwed.
[2015/11/19 18:20:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Eww.
[2015/11/19 18:20:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: However, updating it from a file generated by makepot.sh *did* work, so updating from a URL should work as well.
[2015/11/19 18:21:11] <head8debian> Ok, well thats some hope then. :)
[2015/11/19 18:21:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: Unless I screwed up.
[2015/11/19 18:21:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: Lets hope not.
[2015/11/19 18:21:44] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/19 18:26:47] <Tobbi> I never added the translations submodule to the main repo.

[2015/11/19 19:37:51] <Tobbi> Didn't know you also know spanish.
[2015/11/19 19:38:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: I added a bunch of people to the translation teams. Let's hope they don't abuse their privilege.
[2015/11/19 19:38:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: I just don't know where to pick up. I don't remember all the old filenames.
[2015/11/19 19:38:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh? open the file with a text editor, so you know which level it is?
[2015/11/19 19:38:41] <Tobbi> It has it in the lisp file somewhere.
[2015/11/19 19:39:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: I renamed the .stl level files... and the worldmap didn't get updated. So i have the worldmap with the old file names and the files with new names...
[2015/11/19 19:39:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: I see!

[2015/11/19 19:40:22] <Tobbi> It should contain the old filenames together with the old levels...
[2015/11/19 19:40:24] <head8debian> Ah! That may help!
[2015/11/19 19:49:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uh oh... github is coming out with a new design they say.
[2015/11/19 19:50:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: Wasn't that what I just applied? The thing moved to the header?
[2015/11/19 19:50:33] <head8debian> Tobbi: I haven't applied it yet...
[2015/11/19 19:50:36] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 19:51:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: I believe we should add a script that allows us to package language add-on
[2015/11/19 19:51:01] <Tobbi> s
[2015/11/19 19:51:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Then do it. :-)
[2015/11/19 19:53:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: Not right now.
[2015/11/19 19:54:05] <Tobbi> I don't know how giby normally updates langpacks...

[2015/11/19 20:13:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Then git push?
[2015/11/19 20:13:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yup, you might need to force-push, though.
[2015/11/19 20:13:29] <head8debian> Done.
[2015/11/19 20:13:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: I hope all the levels work now. :D
[2015/11/19 20:14:11] <Tobbi> let's see...
[2015/11/19 20:15:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Maybe we can put brm to work playing the whole forest world. :-)
[2015/11/19 20:15:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 20:15:45] <Tobbi> I'll quickly go through them, don't worry.
[2015/11/19 20:17:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: Looks good, except that it resets your stats now.
[2015/11/19 20:18:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: o_O
[2015/11/19 20:18:15] <head8debian> I go through them a sec also.
[2015/11/19 20:18:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, it's kind of expected that it resets your stats, since those stats depend on the level filename.
[2015/11/19 20:19:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, i won't go through them... ;)
[2015/11/19 20:19:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes.
[2015/11/19 20:19:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: Cannot really be helped.
[2015/11/19 20:19:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Nope, unless we keep the levels...
[2015/11/19 20:19:59] <Tobbi> the level filenames, I mean...
[2015/11/19 20:20:03] <head8debian> Meh.
[2015/11/19 20:20:09] <head8debian> :)
[2015/11/19 20:21:39] <Tobbi> But, we really achieved something...
[2015/11/19 20:21:44] <Tobbi> updating add-ons on transifex etc.
[2015/11/19 20:23:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Is there anything else i can help with that is not graphics related atm?
[2015/11/19 20:23:19] <head8debian> Well, related to drawing graphiocs. ;-)
[2015/11/19 20:23:28] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 20:23:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yes, program a shell file that packages language packs.
[2015/11/19 20:23:42] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 20:23:49] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/19 20:24:05] <head8debian> I could try. Not sure i'd get anywhere.
[2015/11/19 20:24:18] <head8debian> Especially since i don't have a clue how our language packs work.
[2015/11/19 20:24:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: There are templates in the add-ons repository.
[2015/11/19 20:24:43] <Tobbi> check langpack-de
[2015/11/19 20:24:49] <Tobbi> or langpack-cz
[2015/11/19 20:25:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: But i don't speak de. :D
[2015/11/19 20:25:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: Doesn't matter. Just take a look at the file structure.
[2015/11/19 20:25:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ah.
[2015/11/19 20:26:07] <head8debian> I don't like the feel of a chicklet keyboard. Feels like i am going to break it by pushing the keys so hard. :p
[2015/11/19 20:27:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Anything else that needs to be done visually?
[2015/11/19 20:27:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Hmm...let me think.
[2015/11/19 20:27:55] <head8debian> That is not redoing a whole level set? :p

[2015/11/19 20:29:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, why is sound disabled for me?
[2015/11/19 20:30:03] <Tobbi> I don't know...
[2015/11/19 20:30:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: Only in SuperTux or in general?
[2015/11/19 20:30:11] <head8debian> Thats odd...
[2015/11/19 20:30:15] <head8debian> Supertux.
[2015/11/19 20:31:17] <Tobbi> head8debian: Uhm, you did check the settings, did you?
[2015/11/19 20:31:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sound is greyed out. :-/
[2015/11/19 20:31:35] <Tobbi> ah
[2015/11/19 20:31:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: Did we change something recently?
[2015/11/19 20:32:00] <Tobbi> no.

[2015/11/19 20:32:57] <Tobbi> ah, there we go.
[2015/11/19 20:33:23] <head8debian> But why? Every other program of mine can play fine./
[2015/11/19 20:33:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: since when?
[2015/11/19 20:33:52] <Tobbi> I mean: Since when do you have this issue?
[2015/11/19 20:34:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: The last couple weeks.
[2015/11/19 20:35:59] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did we change something in the code / can you bisect?
[2015/11/19 20:36:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: I think its local.
[2015/11/19 20:38:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: ask on the openal mailing list...
[2015/11/19 20:38:40] <Tobbi> or in #openal but it might not be very...you know...frequented...
[2015/11/19 20:39:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: How do i git bisect again?
[2015/11/19 20:39:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: check git help bisect
[2015/11/19 20:42:47] <head8debian> hmm.
[2015/11/19 20:44:21] * head8debian is confused...
[2015/11/19 20:45:09] <Tobbi> What's the problem?
[2015/11/19 20:45:15] <head8debian> Nothing now.
[2015/11/19 20:46:12] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 20:48:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, let's just hope that the source files will update tomorrow. If they don't...well...
[2015/11/19 20:49:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Undo commit time. :D :p
[2015/11/19 20:49:36] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 20:49:44] <head8debian> Everyone panic and call Tobbi! :p
[2015/11/19 20:49:55] <Tobbi> nope, please don't.

[2015/11/19 20:53:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: Can you also update the website to include the supertux editor tutorials written by that guy?
[2015/11/19 20:53:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Must be local. I went back 80 commits and still had the issue.
[2015/11/19 20:53:30] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 20:53:37] <head8debian> If i get around to it
[2015/11/19 20:54:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: "By the way, you may want to add this link to your wiki for the Level Editor - http://dcjtech.info/topic/gaming/#supertux"
[2015/11/19 20:55:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes, i know. :-)
[2015/11/19 20:55:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: I was hoping to make a supetux video but havent gotten that far, and now i have no audio... o_O
[2015/11/19 20:55:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Anyways, i bid you goodnight.
[2015/11/19 20:55:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Ask on the openal mailing list...
[2015/11/19 20:57:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Another mailing list? :p
[2015/11/19 20:57:11] <head8debian> yahoo...
[2015/11/19 20:57:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: https://openal.org/mailman/listinfo/openal
[2015/11/19 20:58:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: I guess that is why i use email filters.
[2015/11/19 20:58:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: What openal version do you use anyway?
[2015/11/19 21:00:03] <head8debian> Tobbi: 1.17
[2015/11/19 21:00:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: I do run Arch now, ya know. :-)
[2015/11/19 21:00:56] <Tobbi> Okay, that seems to be the most recent one.
[2015/11/19 21:01:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: Actually, that was updated 2 days ago.
[2015/11/19 21:01:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Can you switch to an older version?
[2015/11/19 21:02:18] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not without risking breaking my package manager.
[2015/11/19 21:02:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: This is rolling release. Stuff breaks going backwards.
[2015/11/19 21:02:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, then I guess you should really tell the openal guys. This could be the cause of the issue.
[2015/11/19 21:03:00] <head8debian> It didn't happen before hand so its possible.
[2015/11/19 21:03:07] <head8debian> Maybe a reboot will fix it. :p
[2015/11/19 21:03:18] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 21:03:20] <Tobbi> try
[2015/11/19 21:03:30] <Tobbi> Anyway, good night

[2015/11/20 07:15:39] <Tobbi> Hello giby
[2015/11/20 07:15:53] <giby> Hi Tobbi
[2015/11/20 07:16:02] <giby> how long B4 M2?
[2015/11/20 07:16:10] <Tobbi> giby: approximately 1 month.
[2015/11/20 07:16:12] <giby> I should update the translations
[2015/11/20 07:16:16] <Tobbi> giby: I just did.
[2015/11/20 07:16:22] <giby> thanks
[2015/11/20 07:16:28] <Tobbi> giby: So, I changed the translations to update automatically from a repository...
[2015/11/20 07:16:39] <Tobbi> which is this one: https://github.com/SuperTux/translations
[2015/11/20 07:16:55] <Tobbi> giby: In order to change the translations, you run makepot.sh which I modified yesterday...
[2015/11/20 07:17:05] <Tobbi> And then commit and push the changed translations.
[2015/11/20 07:17:10] <Tobbi> I hope this works for you.
[2015/11/20 07:17:17] <giby> that is just the pot...
[2015/11/20 07:17:24] <Tobbi> giby: It can import these automatically...
[2015/11/20 07:17:27] <Tobbi> Transifex I mean.
[2015/11/20 07:17:38] <Tobbi> Ah, yes, not the translations, but the template files.
[2015/11/20 07:17:41] <Tobbi> I am talking about those.
[2015/11/20 07:17:50] <giby> I know with the transfix client
[2015/11/20 07:18:00] <giby> have you updated the po files?
[2015/11/20 07:18:14] <Tobbi> giby: Which ones?
[2015/11/20 07:18:22] <giby> all...
[2015/11/20 07:18:33] <Tobbi> giby: No, I haven't. How do you update those?
[2015/11/20 07:18:50] <giby> Ok, I'll do it then ;)
[2015/11/20 07:19:00] <Tobbi> giby: So, I assume you have that transifex python client?
[2015/11/20 07:19:17] <giby> it just need the transfix client, tx pull then commit and push
[2015/11/20 07:19:28] <Tobbi> giby: Shouldn't we wait until just before the milestone to update them?
[2015/11/20 07:19:50] <Tobbi> or what's the catch?
[2015/11/20 07:20:08] <giby> We should do it just before, but some push before are also welcome
[2015/11/20 07:20:23] <Tobbi> giby: Of course. :)
[2015/11/20 07:20:37] <Tobbi> giby: And how do you normally update the translations on transifex? Before I did that change?
[2015/11/20 07:20:55] <giby> for the pot files?
[2015/11/20 07:21:00] <Tobbi> giby: Yes.
[2015/11/20 07:21:12] <giby> I add them manually, there are just few of them
[2015/11/20 07:21:32] <Tobbi> giby: If we add new worlds, no. :P So, please just push the changes to the translations repository.
[2015/11/20 07:21:52] <Tobbi> It's a submodule in the addons repository as well as the normal game repositoy.
[2015/11/20 07:21:55] <Tobbi> *repository
[2015/11/20 07:22:00] <Tobbi> hope you know how that works...
[2015/11/20 07:22:06] <Tobbi> If not, just ask me.
[2015/11/20 07:22:46] <giby> If I need I'll do
[2015/11/20 07:23:12] <giby> Have you already update on the transfix website?
[2015/11/20 07:23:21] <Tobbi> giby: It updates them automatically now.
[2015/11/20 07:23:27] <giby> ok
[2015/11/20 07:23:29] <Tobbi> From the repository here: https://github.com/SuperTux/translations
[2015/11/20 07:23:37] <Tobbi> Those are the pot files.
[2015/11/20 07:24:01] <Tobbi> giby: Plus, I made an announcement yesterday on transifex that the release is in 1 month.
[2015/11/20 07:24:19] <giby> :)
[2015/11/20 07:24:35] <Tobbi> Aka https://www.transifex.com/arctic-games/supertux/announcements/4818/
[2015/11/20 07:25:19] <Tobbi> giby: So, once again, remember not to update translations on transifex using the web interface, but using the repository. Otherwise, it MIGHT corrupt translations.
[2015/11/20 07:25:40] <giby> Ok
[2015/11/20 07:25:43] <Tobbi> Sorry for being extra paranoid about this.
[2015/11/20 07:25:56] <Tobbi> I was afraid something might break yesterday by auto-updating from pot files,
[2015/11/20 07:26:02] <Tobbi> but it worked just fine, what a realive.
[2015/11/20 07:26:03] <Tobbi> relieve
[2015/11/20 07:28:57] <Tobbi> giby: You update the credits for translators manually, don't you?
[2015/11/20 07:29:36] <giby> yes
[2015/11/20 07:30:16] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/20 07:30:59] <giby> sort by alphabetical of last name ;)
[2015/11/20 07:32:39] <Tobbi> giby: Sounds good. Since there's no script, I'll let you do it ;)
[2015/11/20 07:32:51] <Tobbi> I might develop a script to create language add-ons.
[2015/11/20 07:32:55] <Tobbi> Should best happen before the release
[2015/11/20 07:36:02] <giby> ;)
[2015/11/20 07:37:15] <Tobbi> giby: So, what's your workflow in updating translations? You use the transifex client to fetch translations from there...and then?
[2015/11/20 07:37:55] <giby> use tx to download in the repo.. then commit and push
[2015/11/20 07:38:15] <Tobbi> giby: So, you download the .po files from there...then move them in the right place?

[2015/11/20 07:53:11] <leyyin> I hate translations, and Romanian should not be used on computers stuff anyway
[2015/11/20 07:53:16] <leyyin> it sounds and looks so bad :/
[2015/11/20 07:53:40] <leyyin> Tobbi, https://redd.it/3tgiaj
[2015/11/20 07:54:19] <Tobbi> leyyin: if you continue this, google won't employ you again... :P
[2015/11/20 07:54:28] <Tobbi> leyyin: I don't use google chrome that often.
[2015/11/20 07:55:01] <leyyin> firefox is affected too....
[2015/11/20 07:55:24] <Tobbi> really?
[2015/11/20 07:55:26] <Tobbi> wow.
[2015/11/20 07:56:15] <leyyin> it's worse in firefox, no permission systems
[2015/11/20 07:57:21] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/11/20 07:58:33] <leyyin> I use firefox btw :P
[2015/11/20 07:58:38] <leyyin> chromium is my second browser
[2015/11/20 07:58:50] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/20 07:58:56] <Tobbi> Yeah, same here.
[2015/11/20 07:59:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: But XUL based add-ons won't work any longer in Firefox. At least according to an announcement made by Mozilla a few months back.
[2015/11/20 08:00:32] <leyyin> yes I know
[2015/11/20 08:00:46] <leyyin> I hope they won't suck as much as the chrome extensions
[2015/11/20 08:00:50] <leyyin> memory wise....
[2015/11/20 08:01:16] <Tobbi> No idea.
[2015/11/20 08:10:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: I once met a nice Romanian girl / woman during a Mozilla event. She had something quite beautiful about her... :P
[2015/11/20 08:10:20] <Tobbi> Well, actually, we worked together in the same project...though she was an employee...

[2015/11/20 10:54:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: Nada.
[2015/11/20 10:54:48] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: It was a joke. The @ means he is an OP.
[2015/11/20 10:54:50] <Tobbi> head8debian: That was spanish.
[2015/11/20 10:55:03] <head8debian> Tobbi: Thats all i know of spanish. :-)

[2015/11/20 10:56:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, I'll add you as a translator for English.
[2015/11/20 10:57:14] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/20 10:57:48] <brmbrmcar> There are English variants.

[2015/11/20 12:07:38] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/11/20 12:07:49] <Tobbi> Is there something I've forgotten.
[2015/11/20 12:09:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yesterday...
[2015/11/20 12:09:09] <Tobbi> Right...
[2015/11/20 12:09:32] <Tobbi> head8debian: But it's all okay now :P Translations are updated etc...
[2015/11/20 12:09:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/20 12:10:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, our release date is the 20th now, right?
[2015/11/20 12:10:55] <Tobbi> Fixed release date.
[2015/11/20 12:11:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sure.
[2015/11/20 12:11:41] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/20 12:11:44] <Tobbi> So that's settled.
[2015/11/20 12:12:58] <head8debian> Tobbi: So pretty much everything is done then?
[2015/11/20 12:13:19] <head8debian> Unless we need to change our config to support the latest OpenAL. :D
[2015/11/20 12:13:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't know, yet. I'd love to have langpacks automatically download when people select a language...but not sure if that's possible.
[2015/11/20 12:14:03] <Tobbi> And not sure whether that wouldn't cause problems.
[2015/11/20 12:14:09] <head8debian> That would be nice. How do we do it currently?
[2015/11/20 12:14:21] <Tobbi> head8debian: You download langpacks manually through the add-on manager.
[2015/11/20 12:14:36] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/11/20 12:14:45] <head8debian> Well, that isn't extremely hard then.
[2015/11/20 12:15:03] <Tobbi> I am not sure what can go wrong there...
[2015/11/20 12:15:20] <head8debian> My grandma might find it hard though. :D
[2015/11/20 12:15:24] <head8debian> Sorry grandma. :)
[2015/11/20 12:17:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Your grandma doesn't play SuperTux, I assume.

[2015/11/20 12:19:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: Would've been weird.

[2015/11/20 12:19:54] <head8debian> We both have the same ISP.
[2015/11/20 12:20:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: It was kinda funny. Her computer wouldnt turn on and she wondered if our internet was down. :D
[2015/11/20 12:20:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: I have a father who is not very versed with these things, etiher.
[2015/11/20 12:20:56] <Tobbi> either

[2015/11/20 12:23:14] <brmbrmcar> They think I am the master of all computers when I tell themtheir password!

[2015/11/20 12:24:50] <head8debian> Sure... i don't want a chromebook. Id take windows over it, sadly. :D

[2015/11/20 12:26:40] <head8debian> Their one computer needs a fresh install.
[2015/11/20 12:26:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: I have number-color-synesthesia. That means my numbers have colours when i think about them.
[2015/11/20 12:26:49] <head8debian> Tobbi: o_O

[2015/11/20 12:27:38] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: I told them to get a Chromebook so I didn't have to use Windows or spend hours teaching them.

[2015/11/20 12:28:52] <head8debian> And its not unsupported.
[2015/11/20 12:29:24] <brmbrmcar> This thing ends its life in2019.

[2015/11/20 12:30:59] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Or are you using ubuntu?
[2015/11/20 12:31:24] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Ubuntu LTS gets pittifull updates after the first 3 years are up.
[2015/11/20 12:31:40] <head8debian> And the packages are *old*.
[2015/11/20 12:32:15] <brmbrmcar> I mean Chrome Os.
[2015/11/20 12:32:34] <brmbrmcar> I will get LTS 16.04
[2015/11/20 12:32:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: Package maintainers will update automatically, won't they? I mean: once we release it?
[2015/11/20 12:32:52] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Isn't Chrome OS rolling release though? WOn't it get updated forever?
[2015/11/20 12:33:18] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not in any already relesed versions of OSes.
[2015/11/20 12:33:21] <head8debian> released*
[2015/11/20 12:33:34] <head8debian> Ubuntu 14.04 wont, debian 8 wont, Fedora 23 wont, etc.
[2015/11/20 12:33:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: Not? So, if people run apt-get update it won't update?
[2015/11/20 12:33:47] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Yeah, but this device in particular won't be "supported".
[2015/11/20 12:33:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: They won't push a newer version to their repos.
[2015/11/20 12:33:54] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Ah,
[2015/11/20 12:33:57] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/11/20 12:34:00] <Tobbi> Well, what a shame.
[2015/11/20 12:34:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: They fix bugs, but wont push newer versions.
[2015/11/20 12:34:07] <head8debian> Yes it is.
[2015/11/20 12:34:11] <Tobbi> right.
[2015/11/20 12:34:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: Otherwise none of these OSes would have new packages, and they would be rolling release kindof.
[2015/11/20 12:34:46] <Tobbi> yes, right.

[2015/11/20 16:04:55] <head8debian> Hey Tobbi.
[2015/11/20 16:05:00] <Tobbi> hey, head8debian
[2015/11/20 16:05:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats up? :D
[2015/11/20 16:05:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: The ceiling.
[2015/11/20 16:05:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/20 16:06:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Only nerds respond that way... :p
[2015/11/20 16:06:17] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, people who are tired of that question as well.
[2015/11/20 16:06:45] <brmbrmcar> What's down?
[2015/11/20 16:06:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: True.
[2015/11/20 16:07:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: I usually respond that way.
[2015/11/20 16:07:05] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: The floor.
[2015/11/20 16:07:42] <brmbrmcar> How id the floor?
[2015/11/20 16:07:49] <brmbrmcar> My floor is lava.
[2015/11/20 16:08:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: But, a lot of people have at least translated the menu principale on supertux...
[2015/11/20 16:08:17] <Tobbi> eeh transifex, I mean.
[2015/11/20 16:08:34] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/11/20 16:09:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: Mixxx is awesome. :D
[2015/11/20 16:09:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: What is it?
[2015/11/20 16:10:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: A program... :-)
[2015/11/20 16:10:26] <brmbrmcar> http://www.mixxx.org/
[2015/11/20 16:10:39] <Tobbi> open source, wow.
[2015/11/20 16:11:11] <brmbrmcar> I like looking at code for closed code stuff.
[2015/11/20 16:11:23] <brmbrmcar> Well, I would like to.
[2015/11/20 16:13:38] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Open Source code is supposed to be better...
[2015/11/20 16:13:49] <Tobbi> as in: Better maintained etc.
[2015/11/20 16:14:54] <brmbrmcar> Yeah,but it isn't as fun to see the source of it, because anyone can.
[2015/11/20 16:15:19] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/20 16:15:31] <Tobbi> Also, alket's quit message is an excerpt from Harry Potter I.
[2015/11/20 16:15:34] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/20 16:15:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: Google should be shot. Have you seen their new youtube and google plus layout?
[2015/11/20 16:15:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: I wondered where it was from... i don't like it.
[2015/11/20 16:15:59] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: Up to which percentage of translated items do you include the lang file...
[2015/11/20 16:16:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: You don't like Harry Potter? Have you ever read it?
[2015/11/20 16:16:50] <brmbrmcar> I've never read Harry Potter.
[2015/11/20 16:16:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: No, and i don't like it from its reviews.
[2015/11/20 16:17:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why not? What's wrong with it?
[2015/11/20 16:17:47] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: I agree there.
[2015/11/20 16:19:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Witchcraft, magic and other dark things...
[2015/11/20 16:19:32] <Tobbi> head8debian: *sigh*
[2015/11/20 16:19:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: That we don't need to infilterate our brains with.
[2015/11/20 16:19:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did you decide it or did your parents decide that you don't like it? ;)
[2015/11/20 16:20:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats wrong with Google plus? Too much javascript. :D
[2015/11/20 16:20:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Both. :D
[2015/11/20 16:20:07] <Tobbi> ok.
[2015/11/20 16:20:18] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Wow. We agree on something. :-)
[2015/11/20 16:20:30] <brmbrmcar> I hate the term "magic".
[2015/11/20 16:20:53] <head8debian> I'm not fond of it either.
[2015/11/20 16:21:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: And what good does it profit you to read stuff like that? Read something that has at least some educational value. Like the Chronicles of Narnia. :D
[2015/11/20 16:21:31] <brmbrmcar> People say I ama magicain because I can use inertia.
[2015/11/20 16:21:57] <brmbrmcar> Read How to hackWindows and Mac by brmbrmcar.
[2015/11/20 16:22:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: What does the fox say has no bass.
[2015/11/20 16:22:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: You don't want to tell me that Harry Potter doesn't have educational value, do you? Because the bible doesn't have that, either... :P
[2015/11/20 16:22:42] <brmbrmcar> Uh oh...
[2015/11/20 16:22:48] <Tobbi> I know...
[2015/11/20 16:22:54] * head8debian /ignore 's Tobbi...
[2015/11/20 16:23:01] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/20 16:23:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am serious...
[2015/11/20 16:23:05] * brmbrmcar hides
[2015/11/20 16:23:24] <Tobbi> Tell me about the educational value of the bible?
[2015/11/20 16:24:04] <brmbrmcar> It does mention some things about how to be good.
[2015/11/20 16:24:34] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So does Harry Potter. We have the good side ("White wizards") and the bad side "death eaters"...
[2015/11/20 16:25:00] <brmbrmcar> I like books about brm brm cars.
[2015/11/20 16:25:09] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: ...and that's where you get annoying.
[2015/11/20 16:25:10] <brmbrmcar> And hacking.
[2015/11/20 16:25:12] <Tobbi> Can't you stop that?
[2015/11/20 16:26:04] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Have fun hacking my SSH connection...
[2015/11/20 16:26:27] <brmbrmcar> No fun.
[2015/11/20 16:26:32] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, I was quite serious about that question: Where is the educational value in the bible?

[2015/11/20 16:26:52] <brmbrmcar> I like teddy bear books for toddlers.
[2015/11/20 16:27:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did you really ignore me?
[2015/11/20 16:27:38] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Did you really ignore Tobbi?
[2015/11/20 16:28:03] <head8debian> Yep. :D
[2015/11/20 16:28:13] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: Yep. :D
[2015/11/20 16:28:23] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I can see his answers...
[2015/11/20 16:28:41] <brmbrmcar> Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[2015/11/20 16:29:34] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/20 16:30:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about other books, like lord of the rings?
[2015/11/20 16:30:39] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: What about otherbooks, like Lord of the rings? (by Tobbi)
[2015/11/20 16:30:58] <Tobbi> Can you un-ignore me, please? I didn't say anything offensive
[2015/11/20 16:31:00] <Tobbi> Not remotely.
[2015/11/20 16:31:22] <head8debian> Ive never read it, but have never had any intrest in reading it either.
[2015/11/20 16:31:46] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Can you un-ignore Tobbi, please? Tobbi didn't say anything offensiv
[2015/11/20 16:32:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im not big into very popular books...
[2015/11/20 16:32:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: OKay...that I can understand.
[2015/11/20 16:32:55] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Did you un-ignore?
[2015/11/20 16:33:03] <head8debian> I actually have not read much lately. :-)
[2015/11/20 16:33:17] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Uhm, how would i answer his questions otherwise?
[2015/11/20 16:33:36] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/20 16:33:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, basically... Everything has to be taken with a grain of salt... And the "magic" in Harry Potter is just not the central topic there... It's the relationships between the characters...
[2015/11/20 16:34:05] <brmbrmcar> Most popular books are rubbish.
[2015/11/20 16:34:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: I still have no interest in it...
[2015/11/20 16:34:13] <Tobbi> I am just saying.
[2015/11/20 16:34:22] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What popular books have you read?
[2015/11/20 16:34:43] <brmbrmcar> Er...
[2015/11/20 16:34:48] <Tobbi> yes?
[2015/11/20 16:35:05] <brmbrmcar> I havre only heard about them...
[2015/11/20 16:35:23] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So, wait a second: Your opinion is based on something you have never actually read?
[2015/11/20 16:35:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: I prefer books i can relate to more also.
[2015/11/20 16:35:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Relate to in what way?
[2015/11/20 16:36:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: Harry Potter is someone who goes to wizarding school (just like normal school except the subjects are different), his parents are dead, killed by a very bad man...
[2015/11/20 16:36:12] <brmbrmcar> I only like young childrens' books.
[2015/11/20 16:36:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Like its more of real life!
[2015/11/20 16:37:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im reading this book currently. :D http://www.amazon.com/Teach-Yourself-Electricity-Electronics-Edition/dp/0071741356
[2015/11/20 16:37:51] <head8debian> Actually the 3rd edition, but still...
[2015/11/20 16:37:54] <Tobbi> Okay, that might be interesting...
[2015/11/20 16:38:27] <Tobbi> head8debian: I like this book very much: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Game
[2015/11/20 16:38:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Only 720 pages. :D

[2015/11/20 16:40:43] <Tobbi> or something...
[2015/11/20 16:41:06] <brmbrmcar> Yes... it is actually interesting!
[2015/11/20 16:41:18] <Tobbi> I wouldn't say so...

[2015/11/20 16:45:51] <brmbrmcar> I like good English.
[2015/11/20 16:45:53] <Tobbi> *sigh* I really can't think of why anyone wouldn't like Harry Potter...
[2015/11/20 16:46:11] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Sometimes I think you're someone in your 20s just messing with us.
[2015/11/20 16:46:18] <Tobbi> But, no, you act too immature for that.
[2015/11/20 16:46:28] <Tobbi> But I'd say you're as old as head8debian at least...
[2015/11/20 16:46:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: Thats like me saying i cannot see why no one wouldn't like the Bible or doing what it says.

[2015/11/20 16:48:32] <head8debian> Its harsh, but its what i believe...
[2015/11/20 16:48:46] <brmbrmcar> Is that why you drive a truck?
[2015/11/20 16:48:58] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: :-) Not really.
[2015/11/20 16:49:08] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Trucks are personal opinion.

[2015/11/20 16:49:08] <red_bot> alket, you have notes! [Nov-20 16:44] <head8debian> much better quit message. :D
[2015/11/20 16:49:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, so if you're insane and kill someone while having an episode, you deserve to be killed?
[2015/11/20 16:49:13] <alket> they send the Hagrids dragon to Romania :p
[2015/11/20 16:49:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yep.
[2015/11/20 16:49:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: What if you're borderline intelligent?
[2015/11/20 16:49:42] <leyyin> alket, yup
[2015/11/20 16:49:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: Or someone told you to kill a person and because of your borderline intelligence you do it without thinking about the consequences...
[2015/11/20 16:49:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: And whats that mean? I only understand English. :D
[2015/11/20 16:49:59] <Tobbi> You still deserve to be killed?
[2015/11/20 16:50:13] <head8debian> Tobbi: Pretty much, yes.

[2015/11/20 16:55:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: okay, so my brother has got down's syndrome...If someone put a gun in his hands and told him to pull the trigger, my brother would deserve to die for doing it?
[2015/11/20 16:55:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sadly, yes. Hopefully no one does that though...
[2015/11/20 16:56:04] * head8debian looks at Tobbi.
[2015/11/20 16:56:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: There is no way on earth that he can be considered responsible for what he did...You never make exceptions, do you?
[2015/11/20 16:57:00] <Tobbi> This is cruel.
[2015/11/20 16:57:09] * brmbrmcar is confused...
[2015/11/20 16:57:18] <head8debian> It is cruel, but its what i belive to be correct.
[2015/11/20 16:57:30] <head8debian> I do belive in a couple exceptions though.
[2015/11/20 16:57:50] <brmbrmcar> You believe an exact set of things?
[2015/11/20 16:58:07] <head8debian> If you shoot out of self defence and kill someone i belive that as an exception.
[2015/11/20 16:58:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, assume the following: Two patients were fatally hurt and a doctor doesn't have time to treat both of them, so he has to make a choice whom to treat and the other one dies. Does the doctor deserve to be killed for making a choice?
[2015/11/20 16:58:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: No, he did not willingly kill the person.
[2015/11/20 16:58:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: Neither did my brother whom I give the gun.
[2015/11/20 16:58:48] <brmbrmcar> Get another doctor?
[2015/11/20 16:58:51] <Tobbi> Where do you draw the line.
[2015/11/20 16:58:53] <head8debian> I would probably consider your brother an exception also...
[2015/11/20 16:58:55] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I am very serious.
[2015/11/20 16:58:57] <head8debian> Im thinking. :-)
[2015/11/20 16:59:08] <head8debian> Ive never had to draw this line so deep before...
[2015/11/20 16:59:23] @ Quit: alket: Remote host closed the connection
[2015/11/20 17:00:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: I'd consider you the one to have to die if you gave your brother the gun *and* told your brother to go kill someone...
[2015/11/20 17:00:23] <head8debian> Yes, im puting it bluntly, but you asked.
[2015/11/20 17:00:28] <Tobbi> It's okay...
[2015/11/20 17:00:39] <Tobbi> You making up your mind was all I wanted, really.
[2015/11/20 17:01:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: What if I didn't tell my brother to kill the person?
[2015/11/20 17:01:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: If he did it without any guidance i would probably consider it an exception...
[2015/11/20 17:01:21] <Tobbi> but still gave him the gun?
[2015/11/20 17:01:31] <head8debian> WHy would you give him a gun?
[2015/11/20 17:01:50] <Tobbi> head8debian: *that* is a good question...But assuming I did give him the gun...just because...
[2015/11/20 17:01:51] <head8debian> Unless you have some devius scheme in your head. :p
[2015/11/20 17:02:21] <Tobbi> okay, let's see...
[2015/11/20 17:03:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about doctors who grant a person euthanasia...so the person wants to die because he'd be facing a horrible death otherwise, because he's fatally ill...And the doctor grants that requests, ergo kills that person...
[2015/11/20 17:03:25] <Tobbi> Is he a murderer?
[2015/11/20 17:03:44] <Tobbi> -> does the doctor need to die for granting a wish?
[2015/11/20 17:03:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: But i do know how hard it is to have to deal with people who have "issues" like your brother.
[2015/11/20 17:04:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: It doesn't matter, it was only an example...
[2015/11/20 17:04:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't belive it right that the doctor would do such a thing, but it was the mans choice.
[2015/11/20 17:05:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, but was that choice an independent one?
[2015/11/20 17:05:16] <head8debian> Now, abortion, thats a diferent story. The baby didn't chose to be put to death.
[2015/11/20 17:05:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: What?
[2015/11/20 17:05:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, abortion now: Did the baby choose to live?
[2015/11/20 17:05:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: It would have if it had the chance to...
[2015/11/20 17:06:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: How do we always get onto subjects like these? ;)
[2015/11/20 17:06:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, what if people have sex with the goal to get the woman pregnant, but she doesn't conceive...
[2015/11/20 17:06:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats concieve mean?
[2015/11/20 17:07:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Get pregnant
[2015/11/20 17:07:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: What about it?
[2015/11/20 17:07:19] <head8debian> She cannot help that, he cannot help that.
[2015/11/20 17:07:30] <Tobbi> head8debian: Still, it's a life that was killed before it was born...
[2015/11/20 17:07:34] <Tobbi> Kill both of them?
[2015/11/20 17:07:45] <head8debian> It was a life that was never started.
[2015/11/20 17:07:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: When does a life start?
[2015/11/20 17:08:02] <Tobbi> What *is* a life anyway?
[2015/11/20 17:08:02] <head8debian> Upon Conception.
[2015/11/20 17:08:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: A Egg is a egg untill conception. It is nothing and will be nothing without any interaction.
[2015/11/20 17:09:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: But, wait a second: If the two separate parts haven't been life, how can they together become life?
[2015/11/20 17:09:12] <Tobbi> That doesn't make any sense.
[2015/11/20 17:09:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sex. :)
[2015/11/20 17:09:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, sex means that something that is not alive certainly becomes alive (through witchcraft?)
[2015/11/20 17:10:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its mearly interaction.
[2015/11/20 17:10:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: Is combining baking soda and vinegar witchcraft?
[2015/11/20 17:10:45] <head8debian> That was vague, but...
[2015/11/20 17:10:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Is the combination of soda and vinegar alive?
[2015/11/20 17:11:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: In some ways, yes, but i was using it as a reference. Without the 2 things they are nothing, when they join during fertalization it become something.
[2015/11/20 17:11:49] @ Quit: leyyin: Quit: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
[2015/11/20 17:12:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, another example: Assuming a woman has sex against her will...aka was forced to have sex...And she conceives...
[2015/11/20 17:12:29] <Tobbi> So, she has to give birth to a child...even though she didn't want to conceive in the first place...and she has to care for the child?
[2015/11/20 17:12:32] <head8debian> I don't belive it right for the baby to die.
[2015/11/20 17:13:01] <head8debian> Pretty much, yes.
[2015/11/20 17:13:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: Would you believe it right for her to give birth to a baby she nver wanted?
[2015/11/20 17:13:19] <head8debian> Yes.
[2015/11/20 17:13:31] <Tobbi> head8debian: And what then?
[2015/11/20 17:13:45] <head8debian> Its sad when forced sex happens, but i don't believe the chile should be killed.
[2015/11/20 17:13:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: What then what?
[2015/11/20 17:13:57] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, at which point can a child be considered a child?
[2015/11/20 17:14:13] <head8debian> Tobbi: I consider it at the point of conception.
[2015/11/20 17:14:25] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, so what's the definition of "child"?
[2015/11/20 17:14:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: What do you think? :-)
[2015/11/20 17:14:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: a conveived ovum is just "a bunch of cells"...
[2015/11/20 17:15:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: You are "just a bunch of cells".
[2015/11/20 17:15:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: So is cancer. According to your definition, you'd refuse a person chemo therapy because of that?
[2015/11/20 17:16:00] <Tobbi> As in, let a person die, because killing that "bunch of cells" which is cancer is morally wrong?
[2015/11/20 17:16:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: What? You are starting to make no sense.
[2015/11/20 17:17:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: A fertilized ovum is a bunch of cells, so is a tumor... Since you believe that both is life and neither of those should be killed...
[2015/11/20 17:17:51] <Tobbi> That means refuse a person chemo therapy (which includes killing the tumor)
[2015/11/20 17:17:55] <Tobbi> Is that what you believe?
[2015/11/20 17:18:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: No i don't, because there is a diference between the begining of a life's cells and a cancer cell. We are not born with cancer cells. Cancer cells do not belong in our bodies in the first place.
[2015/11/20 17:19:23] <head8debian> I don't like the methods of removing them, but thats the persons choice.
[2015/11/20 17:20:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: Cancer cells are "the beginning of life".
[2015/11/20 17:20:20] <Tobbi> Of their cancer cell.
[2015/11/20 17:20:26] <Tobbi> They're cells = they are life.
[2015/11/20 17:20:48] <Tobbi> Your body contains several kinds of different cells...
[2015/11/20 17:21:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: Where do you draw the line?
[2015/11/20 17:21:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: No they are not! Its like saying that my motherboard here will one day turn into a printer.
[2015/11/20 17:21:19] <head8debian> Not that my mobo is cancerous. :p
[2015/11/20 17:21:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: How do you define life?
[2015/11/20 17:30:32] <brmbrmcar> Awkward
[2015/11/20 17:31:19] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What's your opinion?
[2015/11/20 17:31:25] <brmbrmcar> On life?
[2015/11/20 17:31:32] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: On anything we just discussed.
[2015/11/20 17:32:03] <brmbrmcar> Well, why just humans?
[2015/11/20 17:32:04] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Or: How would you define life?
[2015/11/20 17:32:23] <brmbrmcar> Er, it is where smething is in control.
[2015/11/20 17:32:42] <brmbrmcar> That is all I'd say.
[2015/11/20 17:33:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Elaborate.
[2015/11/20 17:33:48] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/20 17:34:04] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I meant: Explain what you mean.
[2015/11/20 17:34:46] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2015/11/20 17:35:07] <brmbrmcar> I am talking more physics, the only explanation I could say.
[2015/11/20 17:35:44] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So, how does something look which isn't in control? Or: Are dead things not in control in terms of physics?
[2015/11/20 17:36:13] <brmbrmcar> A computer.
[2015/11/20 17:36:24] <brmbrmcar> I mean in control of itself directly.
[2015/11/20 17:37:05] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How do you define control? Doesn't control depend on a certain... willfullness?
[2015/11/20 17:37:58] <brmbrmcar> Like, of your own body.
[2015/11/20 17:39:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: We humans aren't completely rational beings...
[2015/11/20 17:39:29] <Tobbi> Thus, our motivation for doing something are not completely "controlled" by us...
[2015/11/20 17:40:50] <brmbrmcar> Yeah...
[2015/11/20 17:41:18] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Okay, animals are often driven by instincts...Are they in control?
[2015/11/20 17:42:24] <brmbrmcar> Yes, in theory
[2015/11/20 17:42:32] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: In theory?
[2015/11/20 17:42:39] <Tobbi> Elaborate on that, please.
[2015/11/20 17:44:04] <brmbrmcar> I am confused.
[2015/11/20 17:44:06] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/20 17:45:20] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What is control? Assuming you refused to eat and drink...are you in control of staying alive?
[2015/11/20 17:46:45] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/20 17:46:57] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How, if you refused to eat and drink?
[2015/11/20 17:47:23] <brmbrmcar> Don't refuse?
[2015/11/20 17:47:33] <brmbrmcar> If you couldn't then no.
[2015/11/20 17:48:13] <red_bot> Delay note from 'head8debian' written on 11-20-15 at 17:22PM "I will be back around 10PM tonight, sorry to have to run so fast".
[2015/11/20 17:48:30] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: But, wait, you said that you are in total control...
[2015/11/20 17:48:44] <brmbrmcar> Not of death.
[2015/11/20 17:48:58] <brmbrmcar> I am not thinking religously.
[2015/11/20 17:49:49] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Total control would mean being objective regarding everything right? Because otherwise, your control would be biased...
[2015/11/20 17:49:57] <Tobbi> And thus you wouldn't have total unbiased control...
[2015/11/20 17:50:11] <Tobbi> However, humans are never unbiased.
[2015/11/20 17:50:20] <Tobbi> Our bias is what separates us from machines.
[2015/11/20 17:50:32] <brmbrmcar> Control generally.
[2015/11/20 17:50:48] <brmbrmcar> A machine has no soul.
[2015/11/20 17:51:01] <brmbrmcar> Apart from robots.
[2015/11/20 17:51:16] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Control is only control when you're equally likely to do certain things.
[2015/11/20 17:51:30] <Tobbi> In my opinion.
[2015/11/20 17:51:59] <Tobbi> Control is when you have equal, unbiased choices that you can take.
[2015/11/20 17:52:02] <Tobbi> But life isn't like that.
[2015/11/20 17:52:10] <brmbrmcar> But you are choosing to type now!
[2015/11/20 17:52:16] <brmbrmcar> That is control.
[2015/11/20 17:52:35] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: hmm...
[2015/11/20 17:53:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: assuming I decided to kill a person earlier, and I am now in jail... And I chose to go home...
[2015/11/20 17:53:24] <Tobbi> I would have no way...
[2015/11/20 17:53:38] <Tobbi> Thus, I am not in total control.
[2015/11/20 17:53:42] <brmbrmcar> Yes, that is more physical.
[2015/11/20 17:53:50] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Physical?
[2015/11/20 17:53:53] <brmbrmcar> Your body cannot do it.
[2015/11/20 17:54:06] <brmbrmcar> Your hardware.
[2015/11/20 17:54:17] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Where do you draw the line? Isn't control dependent on other factors as well?
[2015/11/20 17:54:29] <Tobbi> On external factors, like society and the world around you?
[2015/11/20 17:54:53] <brmbrmcar> External factors can be choice.
[2015/11/20 17:55:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Even if choose to, I wouldn't be able to leave the prison...
[2015/11/20 17:55:18] <Tobbi> Or get any girlfriend I wanted for that matter.
[2015/11/20 17:55:23] <Tobbi> So choice is limited.
[2015/11/20 17:55:42] <Tobbi> You don't become almighty only because you have a choice.
[2015/11/20 17:56:05] <brmbrmcar> You can't write an operating system to make your computer waterproof.
[2015/11/20 17:56:25] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So you're not in total control...
[2015/11/20 17:56:30] <brmbrmcar> But you can make it play SuperTux.
[2015/11/20 17:56:38] <Tobbi> Your choice is severely limited by external factors...
[2015/11/20 17:56:44] <brmbrmcar> But it can't always hack.
[2015/11/20 17:57:42] <brmbrmcar> That is my best explanation.
[2015/11/20 17:58:08] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: My point is: If your choice is limited by external factors, that means you're not in total control...
[2015/11/20 17:59:10] <brmbrmcar> Exactly.
[2015/11/20 17:59:32] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: But that means you're not alive.
[2015/11/20 18:00:01] <brmbrmcar> How?
[2015/11/20 18:00:07] <brmbrmcar> I have a soul.
[2015/11/20 18:00:19] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Since your definition of "being alive" is "being in control"...
[2015/11/20 18:00:21] <Tobbi> But you're not in control...
[2015/11/20 18:00:30] <Tobbi> there are things beyond your control.
[2015/11/20 18:01:13] <brmbrmcar> Being alive is having a soul.
[2015/11/20 18:01:20] <brmbrmcar> And the control.
[2015/11/20 18:01:38] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How do you define having a soul?
[2015/11/20 18:01:54] <brmbrmcar> Soemthing you xan think with.
[2015/11/20 18:02:01] <brmbrmcar> Choose tothink with.
[2015/11/20 18:02:14] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So anything which can think is alive?
[2015/11/20 18:02:23] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What about plants...do plants "think"?
[2015/11/20 18:02:26] <Tobbi> How do you define thinking?
[2015/11/20 18:02:49] <Tobbi> Plants adapt to the environment around them, I believe without thinking...Thus they're not alive?
[2015/11/20 18:03:39] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/20 18:04:05] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Okay, but bacteria don't think either. Not alive?
[2015/11/20 18:04:10] <Tobbi> Or cancer cells...
[2015/11/20 18:04:14] <Tobbi> Or fertilized ovae.
[2015/11/20 18:04:23] <Tobbi> So, all of these things are not alive?
[2015/11/20 18:06:29] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/20 18:06:41] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/20 18:06:55] <brmbrmcar> Who said they wre?
[2015/11/20 18:06:58] @ alket joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/20 18:07:06] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: But you are a collection of cells... So if these are not alive because themselves they don't think...how can the resulting human be alive?
[2015/11/20 18:07:29] <brmbrmcar> I am not a scientist.

[2015/11/20 19:54:06] <Karkus> Tobbi: What do you mean?
[2015/11/20 19:54:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: I updated localizations on transifex, using makepot.sh to create the files.
[2015/11/20 19:54:30] <Tobbi> I set it to update automatically from a git submodule, and even that worked.
[2015/11/20 19:54:33] <Tobbi> I was quite surprised.
[2015/11/20 19:54:41] <Tobbi> I expected localizations to be lost.

[2015/11/21 08:56:22] <Tobbi> let me try to get a better stacktrace.
[2015/11/21 08:56:36] <grumbel> the libsupertux2 is needed for googletest, if you build with 'cmake .. -DBUILD_TEST=ON' it will create supertux2 and test_supertux2
[2015/11/21 08:56:43] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/11/21 08:56:56] <grumbel> run with supertux --debug, that should print the file where it goes broke
[2015/11/21 08:57:42] <Tobbi> Yes, one moment.
[2015/11/21 08:57:55] <Tobbi> my gdb is going mad right now.
[2015/11/21 08:57:57] <Tobbi> due to recursion.

[2015/11/21 09:01:06] <grumbel> you could try compiling sexp-cpp with: cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWARNINGS=ON -DWERROR=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
[2015/11/21 09:01:14] <Tobbi> okay...

[2015/11/21 09:02:59] <grumbel> compiling supertux with 'cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON' and then running 'build/test_supertux2' is also worth a try

[2015/11/21 09:23:08] <Tobbi> grumbel: You're recursively calling the destructor for some reason...
[2015/11/21 09:23:42] <Tobbi> Value::Destroy() calls the destructor of m_cons.
[2015/11/21 09:23:55] <Tobbi> Which in turn calls Value::Destroy()
[2015/11/21 09:23:58] <Tobbi> At least that|s what I can see..
[2015/11/21 09:24:20] <grumbel> it should be calling destroy() on another sexp::Value, not on the same
[2015/11/21 09:24:31] <grumbel> it's probably some invalid pointer dereference foobar
[2015/11/21 09:25:33] <Tobbi> I already checked against NULL...doesn|t make any difference.

[2015/11/21 09:36:10] <Tobbi> Or one of hume's?
[2015/11/21 09:39:04] <Karkus> It's impossible trying to find a level when you don't know which of christoph1, christoph2 and christoph3 it is

[2015/11/21 09:48:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, an issue regarding the way stats are saved.
[2015/11/21 09:49:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes...Something like "Rework stats"
[2015/11/21 09:49:15] <Tobbi> Or something.
[2015/11/21 09:49:19] <Tobbi> I don't know.
[2015/11/21 09:49:38] <Tobbi> We could save an arbitrary ID in the stl file...
[2015/11/21 09:49:42] <Tobbi> and then set that...
[2015/11/21 09:49:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: But then again, the forest world isn't exactly supposed to be stable anyway, so we could merge this now...
[2015/11/21 09:49:59] <Tobbi> Yes, that's true.
[2015/11/21 09:50:09] <Tobbi> It's not supposed to be stable until about now :P
[2015/11/21 09:50:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: I reckon we do both
[2015/11/21 09:50:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, it just isn't

[2015/11/21 10:01:48] <Tobbi> I added him to Core and Developers teams...
[2015/11/21 10:01:53] <Tobbi> He's proven himself worthwhile.
[2015/11/21 10:05:27] <brmbrmcar> I can take screenshots.

[2015/11/21 12:45:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah.
[2015/11/21 12:45:14] <Karkus> Okay
[2015/11/21 12:46:23] <brmbrmcar> Earth Tux's light should only be an aid, and not react with blocks.
[2015/11/21 12:46:40] <brmbrmcar> Otherwise it makes the game actually harder.
[2015/11/21 12:47:13] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: This is a feature for levels which I have considered basing a whole level around.
[2015/11/21 12:47:25] <Karkus> All light should do this.
[2015/11/21 12:47:47] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but then the light should be 360.
[2015/11/21 12:48:17] <Karkus> Err, well, no.
[2015/11/21 12:48:22] <Tobbi> It is a lamp...

[2015/11/21 12:49:15] <Karkus> Or maybe not :D

[2015/11/21 12:50:50] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/11/21 12:51:21] <Karkus> Mr Candle isn't a magic block
[2015/11/21 12:51:36] <brmbrmcar> I have a feeling it will throw up a bug.

[2015/11/21 13:14:01] <brmbrmcar> Tothe commit message...
[2015/11/21 13:14:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: Did i do something wrong?
[2015/11/21 13:15:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, perfectly fine.
[2015/11/21 13:15:49] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/11/21 13:16:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why is that (target-time 0) added, though?
[2015/11/21 13:16:51] <brmbrmcar> New level editor does that.
[2015/11/21 13:17:06] <brmbrmcar> It doesn't make any difference.
[2015/11/21 13:17:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: I have no clue.
[2015/11/21 13:17:35] <Tobbi> The new level editor should be changed in that aspect.

[2015/11/21 13:18:10] <brmbrmcar> Why?
[2015/11/21 13:18:22] <brmbrmcar> It is only time wasting.
[2015/11/21 13:18:24] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: worldmaps don't have a target time at all.
[2015/11/21 13:19:39] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but it makes no difference to anything.
[2015/11/21 13:19:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't know why that line showed up. I was puzzled myself.
[2015/11/21 13:20:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: You can edit it out with a text editor, commit, squash...

[2015/11/21 13:21:42] <brmbrmcar> Maybe target times can be automatically deleted if set to zero, but it still shouldn't bother worldmaps.
[2015/11/21 13:22:25] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Removing it can be done quickly...
[2015/11/21 13:23:01] <brmbrmcar> And anyway, it's a nice way to see if something's been updated.

[2015/11/21 13:30:40] <Tobbi> Hume2: is there a reason why you can't move https://github.com/Hume2/supertux/blob/unordered_path/src/object/path_walker.cpp#L116 inside the switch?

[2015/11/21 14:15:57] <Fire_> Hey
[2015/11/21 14:16:15] <Fire_> Yeah, my first name would be more adequate to what I'm trying to do!
[2015/11/21 14:16:18] <brmbrmcar> Doyou want to compile Supertux?
[2015/11/21 14:16:34] <Fire_> Trying to compile it on WIndows with VS 2013
[2015/11/21 14:16:40] <Tobbi> oh...
[2015/11/21 14:16:47] <Fire_> xD
[2015/11/21 14:16:52] <brmbrmcar> Haven't a clue how.
[2015/11/21 14:17:00] <brmbrmcar> I am the idiot around here.
[2015/11/21 14:17:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Stop it!
[2015/11/21 14:17:13] <Fire_> I compile it, but when I try to run it, gives the error: 0xc00007b
[2015/11/21 14:17:25] <Tobbi> That's not very verboe.
[2015/11/21 14:17:27] <Tobbi> verbose
[2015/11/21 14:19:07] <Fire_> I followed the steps here: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/INSTALL.md
[2015/11/21 14:19:20] <Fire_> But I had to copy some .dll manually
[2015/11/21 14:22:54] <Tobbi> Fire_: Do you have WinDBG installed? Or some other debugger?
[2015/11/21 14:23:24] <Fire_> Going to check with that
[2015/11/21 14:23:30] <brmbrmcar> Are you mixing 32 bit and 64 bit dlls?
[2015/11/21 14:23:51] <Tobbi> Fire_: Would you know how to get a backtrace? If so, go ahead.
[2015/11/21 14:23:52] <Fire_> Think not.
[2015/11/21 14:24:29] <Fire_> (about the DLL I mean)
[2015/11/21 14:24:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Maybe they are just busy.
[2015/11/21 14:25:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: No. one person walked past me and I said "Good day" or something and she pretended that she didn't hear me.
[2015/11/21 14:25:08] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/21 14:26:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: As i said, she was preoccupied. Just because they may seem rude doesn't mean that you have to seem rude back. :D
[2015/11/21 14:26:24] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am never explicitly rude.
[2015/11/21 14:26:31] <Tobbi> implicitly, maybe.
[2015/11/21 14:26:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well good...
[2015/11/21 14:27:15] <brmbrmcar> Fire_: OK. Er...
[2015/11/21 14:27:24] <Tobbi> head8debian: by the way: Wouldn't it be cool if you could create your own badguys from a lisp definition file?
[2015/11/21 14:27:25] <Fire_> I'm trying some stuff out, meanwhile
[2015/11/21 14:27:57] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/21 14:28:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, maybe?
[2015/11/21 14:28:55] <Tobbi> Or not...I don't know.
[2015/11/21 14:29:18] <brmbrmcar> Fire_: All I could see about the error was 32 and 64 bit stuff getting muddled.
[2015/11/21 14:29:28] <brmbrmcar> Might be to do with Supertux...
[2015/11/21 14:30:03] <Fire_> I'm using the dependencies from INSTALL.md, the only dll i had to copy manually was ssleay32.dll
[2015/11/21 14:30:23] <brmbrmcar> And were the others 64?
[2015/11/21 14:30:36] <brmbrmcar> sslway seems like 32 bit.
[2015/11/21 14:30:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: O_O
[2015/11/21 14:31:06] <Fire_> Others seem to be 32 too
[2015/11/21 14:31:17] <brmbrmcar> OK, then.
[2015/11/21 14:31:25] <Tobbi> head8debian: What?
[2015/11/21 14:31:41] <brmbrmcar> I know nothing about the Supertux build process, so...
[2015/11/21 14:35:49] <brmbrmcar> I want everything able to be made from a lisp definition file.

[2015/11/22 06:15:07] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/22 06:15:25] <Tobbi> I need to clear the snow...

[2015/11/22 06:15:28] <Tobbi> will do so in a minute.
[2015/11/22 06:15:38] <Tobbi> You're required to do so.
[2015/11/22 06:15:42] <Tobbi> according to law.
[2015/11/22 06:16:03] <brmbrmcar> Naughty law!
[2015/11/22 06:17:34] <Tobbi> Not really...
[2015/11/22 06:17:42] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/22 06:17:52] <brmbrmcar> It is a pain though.
[2015/11/22 06:18:12] <brmbrmcar> And I like snow because its cold.
[2015/11/22 06:18:35] <Hume2> I like snow because of SuperTux :D
[2015/11/22 06:19:01] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2015/11/22 06:23:02] <Tobbi> Hume2: Can you please update the Czech translation on transifex? I fixed some source string typos.
[2015/11/22 06:23:26] <Tobbi> Basically, all issues that were reported in the last year and which giby didn't address...
[2015/11/22 06:26:32] <Tobbi> You shouldn't need to re-translate stuff...You can just click the appropriate thing from the translation memory.

[2015/11/22 06:36:45] <brmbrmcar> I haven't a clue.
[2015/11/22 06:37:53] <grumbel> Can anybody reproduce the issue of supertux getting really really slow in --debug mode?
[2015/11/22 06:38:03] <Karkus> grumbel: Let me try
[2015/11/22 06:38:04] <grumbel> Doesn't happen always, but like every second or third restart of the game
[2015/11/22 06:38:30] <grumbel> It's only slow for 30sec or so, then it goes back to normal
[2015/11/22 06:38:50] <grumbel> might be an AMD graphics driver issue, but could also be something completely different
[2015/11/22 06:39:06] <Karkus> It's fairly slow anyway, because of these -> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/labels/involves%3Aperformance
[2015/11/22 06:39:13] <brmbrmcar> No, but I do get the same issue sometimes starting normally.
[2015/11/22 06:42:07] <grumbel> any objections against merging feature/gtest into master?
[2015/11/22 06:42:57] <Karkus> grumbel: I've tried it quite a few times, and I haven't noticed any difference whatsoever
[2015/11/22 06:43:16] <Karkus> grumbel: I don't actually know what gtest does...

[2015/11/22 06:50:38] <grumbel> yes
[2015/11/22 06:50:42] <Tobbi> So it shouldn't have any impact on the final game at all.
[2015/11/22 06:50:44] <Tobbi> Thus can be merged.

[2015/11/22 06:51:58] <brmbrmcar> How much snow?
[2015/11/22 06:53:25] <Tobbi> Not enough to be clearing...
[2015/11/22 06:53:29] <Tobbi> apparently.
[2015/11/22 06:54:00] <brmbrmcar> So I'm not missing out.
[2015/11/22 06:54:35] <Tobbi> grumbel: Couldn't you only build a static library in case people actively choose to configure with -DTest?

[2015/11/22 06:55:24] <grumbel> not really worth the effort, static library doesn't add much extra time, it's just scooping up all the .o files into an lib*.a

[2015/11/22 10:15:16] <Tobbi> leyyin: My bachelor project https://github.com/tobbi/projectgenerator
[2015/11/22 10:15:51] <leyyin> ahem Tobbi, .gitignore .DS_STORE
[2015/11/22 10:15:59] <leyyin> *perfectionism intensifies*
[2015/11/22 10:16:01] <Tobbi> leyyin: No. :P
[2015/11/22 10:16:12] <Tobbi> leyyin: Having this on github was just not that important to me.
[2015/11/22 10:16:23] <Tobbi> I mean: I didn't really care about perfectionism anyway.
[2015/11/22 10:16:35] <Tobbi> My thesis was 119 pages. I had no way to change that.

[2015/11/22 10:16:40] <Tobbi> rather, no time.

[2015/11/22 10:17:56] <Tobbi> leyyin: The paragraph about negative aspects is even longer...
[2015/11/22 10:19:59] <leyyin> Tobbi, when you have great power you also have great responsibility :P
[2015/11/22 10:19:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: I have achieved a new low in relationships with society. People in my neighborhood ignore me even when I greet them :D
[2015/11/22 10:21:07] <leyyin> Tobbi, did that happen multiple times?
[2015/11/22 10:21:26] <Tobbi> leyyin: Oh, I told you already, didn't I? :D
[2015/11/22 10:21:30] <Tobbi> But it happens sometimes...
[2015/11/22 10:21:45] <leyyin> sometimes they do not hear...
[2015/11/22 10:21:55] <leyyin> just saying, I do not think they do it on purpose
[2015/11/22 10:22:11] <Tobbi> leyyin: Believe me, they do.
[2015/11/22 10:22:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: I'm really unpopular with the neighbours...
[2015/11/22 10:22:45] <leyyin> Tobbi, ask why, then fix it
[2015/11/22 10:22:54] <Tobbi> Mainly for not caring about my garden, keeping the christmas lights out even when its not christmas...
[2015/11/22 10:22:55] <Tobbi> >D
[2015/11/22 10:22:56] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/22 10:23:01] <Tobbi> And staying isolated.
[2015/11/22 10:23:10] <leyyin> Tobbi, you suck as a neighour then :P
[2015/11/22 10:23:20] @ Hume2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/22 10:23:24] <Tobbi> leyyin: I know. But I don't want to be dictated what to do by society...
[2015/11/22 10:23:27] <Tobbi> Thus, I do these things.
[2015/11/22 10:23:32] <leyyin> get your shit together
[2015/11/22 10:23:34] <leyyin> Tobbi, edgy
[2015/11/22 10:24:09] <Tobbi> leyyin: Not really... I believe people look down on me. i'm not willing to contribute to that by complying with society...
[2015/11/22 10:24:27] <leyyin> does not make any sense :D
[2015/11/22 10:24:42] <Karkus> I don't think either of you have OCD, by the way
[2015/11/22 10:25:02] <leyyin> not sure if compliment or insult, hmm.....
[2015/11/22 10:25:16] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes it does. If I comply with society, that means that people think I comply... If they accept me the way I am, I might even get to do the garden.
[2015/11/22 10:25:31] <Tobbi> But since they don't accept me as an equal, even though I don't do my garden, I don't do my garden.
[2015/11/22 10:25:40] <leyyin> does not make any sense
[2015/11/22 10:25:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am not so sure about the OCD part...I had OCD issues in the past.
[2015/11/22 10:25:45] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes it does.
[2015/11/22 10:25:48] <Mathnerd314> Tobbi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNkDJk5_9eU
[2015/11/22 10:25:51] <leyyin> for me it does not
[2015/11/22 10:25:58] <Tobbi> hahaha
[2015/11/22 10:26:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'm just trying to point out perfectionism != OCD
[2015/11/22 10:26:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: right...
[2015/11/22 10:27:24] <Tobbi> leyyin: What I want is for people to see me as an individual and not as "just this anonymous member of society", and once they do that they realize that my garden is my business.
[2015/11/22 10:27:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: Because OCD is a far wider problem, it can include automatic thoughts, and other pretty horrible symptoms.
[2015/11/22 10:27:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have had OCD automatic thoughts before.
[2015/11/22 10:27:46] <Tobbi> So, I know how it feels like.
[2015/11/22 10:27:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: I see..
[2015/11/22 10:27:54] <leyyin> Tobbi, you should be more like me, not give a shit what other people think :P
[2015/11/22 10:28:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: It's harder than you think.
[2015/11/22 10:28:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: Did / doyou? have OCD I mean?
[2015/11/22 10:28:45] <leyyin> Tobbi, you know in murica it's illegal to not mow your lawn
[2015/11/22 10:28:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: what? :D
[2015/11/22 10:29:02] <Tobbi> leyyin: everywhere in america?
[2015/11/22 10:29:07] <leyyin> almost everwhere
[2015/11/22 10:29:55] <leyyin> Tobbi, the neibhourhood can fine you ;)
[2015/11/22 10:30:07] <Tobbi> leyyin: haha, I'd get fined constantly...
[2015/11/22 10:30:09] <leyyin> because you are lowering the house pricing in that area
[2015/11/22 10:30:21] <leyyin> Tobbi, then they will drive you out with police....
[2015/11/22 10:30:28] <Tobbi> leyyin: With that many students in my hometown, everyone should be glad.
[2015/11/22 10:32:55] <Tobbi> leyyin: By the way: The scammers claiming to be microsoft don't call me anymore... :-( I fucked with them too extensively...
[2015/11/22 10:33:35] <Tobbi> Unless they call next month...but I doubt they'll do it.
[2015/11/22 10:33:36] <leyyin> cool scammers :D
[2015/11/22 10:33:47] <head8debian> mt: Do you have audio issues in supertux with the latest OpenAL installed?
[2015/11/22 10:33:58] <head8debian> mt: You do run Arch?
[2015/11/22 10:34:30] <leyyin> I run arch on my small laptop :P
[2015/11/22 10:34:46] <leyyin> I did not get audio to work yet thought
[2015/11/22 10:35:08] <Tobbi> leyyin: Well, I didn't understand that indian random person (indians all sound the same, no matter whether guy or girl or horse) and they forwarded me to their manager...And once I couldn't understand that person either, after some time of pretending to understand, I was like "Okay, this time I wanted to scam you for a change"...
[2015/11/22 10:35:15] <head8debian> leyyin: *most* people wont get fined for not mowing their lawns. Its mainly in more expensive areas that you can.
[2015/11/22 10:35:16] <Tobbi> And I believe that made them stop.
[2015/11/22 10:35:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Faith in humanity restored.
[2015/11/22 10:35:49] <head8debian> Tobbi: I got a spam email from a suposable patreon hack. :-)
[2015/11/22 10:35:55] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/22 10:36:02] <Tobbi> I get all kinds of spam mail...
[2015/11/22 10:36:33] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't. Maybe one every week.
[2015/11/22 10:36:58] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: It would be cool if all these girls in the video were smart programmer chicks...
[2015/11/22 10:36:59] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/22 10:37:03] <Tobbi> not sure if they are...
[2015/11/22 10:37:07] <Tobbi> maybe they're.
[2015/11/22 10:37:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: I won't email the OpenAL team until i hear back from someone else with the same issue.
[2015/11/22 10:37:29] <leyyin> head8debian, it's your driver :P
[2015/11/22 10:37:29] <Tobbi> head8debian: You can use a different email address...a temporary forwarding address.
[2015/11/22 10:37:36] <Mathnerd314> Tobbi: well, you'd have to attend the SUSEcon to find out...
[2015/11/22 10:37:43] <Tobbi> ;)

[2015/11/22 10:39:34] <head8debian> Thats odd.

[2015/11/22 10:39:41] <mt> interesting

[2015/11/22 10:40:21] <head8debian> mt: Uh?
[2015/11/22 10:40:25] <head8debian> Hmm.
[2015/11/22 10:41:08] <grumbel> Is the console in SuperTux working for anybody?
[2015/11/22 10:41:18] <Tobbi> grumbel: It has always been working for me.
[2015/11/22 10:41:24] <Tobbi> grumbel: Please check what mt said above.
[2015/11/22 10:41:27] <head8debian> mt: Does the git version of supertux have audio with the latest version of OpenAL on your system?
[2015/11/22 10:41:38] <head8debian> Console in supertux...?
[2015/11/22 10:41:57] <mt> what the packaging scripts are basically doing is `cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DINSTALL_SUBDIR_BIN=bin; make; make DESTDIR="${pkgdir}/" install`, then tar up $pkgdir and use it as package
[2015/11/22 10:42:10] <mt> that package then doesn't include the binary
[2015/11/22 10:42:11] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: I like the parody more than the original.
[2015/11/22 10:42:15] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/22 10:42:30] <mt> head8debian: I can't check since the binary doesn't exist, duh
[2015/11/22 10:43:21] <head8debian> mt: Your building from a PKGBUILD?
[2015/11/22 10:43:30] <mt> yes
[2015/11/22 10:43:49] <Tobbi> grumbel: Check the shortcut for the console.
[2015/11/22 10:43:52] <Tobbi> And change it..
[2015/11/22 10:44:02] <Tobbi> I had to change the shortcut as well.
[2015/11/22 10:44:23] <head8debian> mt: Im building directly from git.
[2015/11/22 10:44:36] <head8debian> Not using a PKGBUILD.
[2015/11/22 10:44:43] <mt> well, the pkgbuild takes the git repo and uses it
[2015/11/22 10:44:55] <mt> because the Arch way
[2015/11/22 10:45:32] <mt> better write a pkgbuild than install something to some place and not knowing what it installs to what place

[2015/11/22 10:46:19] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/22 10:47:45] <grumbel> No luck with the console, it shows up in --debug mode, but then just disappears. Rebinding keys doesn't help
[2015/11/22 10:48:00] <mt> head8debian: music works, but it says `connect(2) call to /dev/shm/jack-1000/default/jack_0 failed (err=No such file or directory)` on startup
[2015/11/22 10:48:29] <Tobbi> grumbel: The console showing up and disappearing is intended behaviour.
[2015/11/22 10:48:36] <Tobbi> That's just for showing messages.
[2015/11/22 10:48:58] <Tobbi> grumbel: Did you try setting the console key to one of the F1..F12 keys?
[2015/11/22 10:49:02] <Tobbi> If not, try it.

[2015/11/22 10:54:01] <head8debian> quack it. Get it?
[2015/11/22 10:54:06] <Tobbi> okay...
[2015/11/22 10:54:08] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/22 10:54:15] <Tobbi> I googled it.
[2015/11/22 10:54:31] <Tobbi> Also, it was just opened yesterday.
[2015/11/22 10:56:23] <head8debian> I see that.

[2015/11/22 11:06:48] <mt> well, install pulseaudio; reboot or reload systemd's socket activation defaults
[2015/11/22 11:07:11] <head8debian> mt: It should work through either method.
[2015/11/22 11:07:35] <mt> yeah, it *should* work, but

[2015/11/22 12:53:49] <head8debian> I see.
[2015/11/22 12:53:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: Do we want all the passwords to be the same also?
[2015/11/22 12:54:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: I set a new password for the twitter handle.
[2015/11/22 12:54:18] <Tobbi> One that I'll have difficulties to remember.
[2015/11/22 12:54:20] <head8debian> I have set up 100 key passwords for our google account and email.
[2015/11/22 12:54:27] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/22 12:54:37] <head8debian> Thanks Keepassx.
[2015/11/22 12:55:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, who should i msg the info to. It *should* be safe to PM the info. Otherwise i can try to encrypt with GPG.
[2015/11/22 12:55:15] <brmbrmcar> 100 different ones or a 100 character long one?
[2015/11/22 12:55:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: uhm...one moment.
[2015/11/22 12:55:25] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: 100 character long.
[2015/11/22 12:55:39] <brmbrmcar> Why that secure?
[2015/11/22 12:56:23] <Tobbi> Unfortunately, I don't have any working GPG keys...
[2015/11/22 12:56:32] <Karkus> head8debian: Now that's too far. Most of my passwords are at least 15 chars, but thats enough
[2015/11/22 12:56:33] <brmbrmcar> There is no point. If someone really wanted to know the password they could hack into the sending of it.
[2015/11/22 12:56:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: Can you set up forwarding?
[2015/11/22 12:56:56] <brmbrmcar> I like long passwords though. :D
[2015/11/22 12:56:59] <Tobbi> As in: Forward all emails to that email address to my email?
[2015/11/22 12:57:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, what do you mean?
[2015/11/22 12:57:05] <Tobbi> I just explained.
[2015/11/22 12:57:06] <head8debian> I doubt it.
[2015/11/22 12:57:12] <Tobbi> really? Can't you try?

[2015/11/22 13:19:34] <Hume2> I think that the ideas should go to the forum.

[2015/11/22 13:20:50] <head8debian> We don't need a google+ page if we have a twitter page...
[2015/11/22 13:20:51] <Karkus> Hume2: It's difficult to know

[2015/11/22 13:21:49] <Karkus> Hume2: Where to put things.
[2015/11/22 13:22:02] <Karkus> The forum is less active than GitHub, for example
[2015/11/22 13:22:10] <Karkus> But I agree
[2015/11/22 13:22:31] <Hume2> At least the forum will be more active.
[2015/11/22 13:22:41] <Karkus> Hume2: Hopefully
[2015/11/22 13:23:15] <Karkus> Once we have a list of things there, it should be moved manually onto the wiki, and then slowly issues should be created for each thing.
[2015/11/22 13:25:20] <Hume2> That could work.
[2015/11/22 13:27:35] <Tobbi> We should get a verified handle on twitter.
[2015/11/22 13:27:42] <head8debian> Now we have a youtube page with no videos.
[2015/11/22 13:27:55] <brmbrmcar> Link for youtube page?

[2015/11/22 13:40:12] <brmbrmcar> Or /describe, but I haven't a clue how it works.
[2015/11/22 13:40:52] <mt> /me is actually an ACTION CTCP
[2015/11/22 13:40:58] * Hume2 didn't got too how /describe works.
[2015/11/22 13:41:10] <brmbrmcar> Try /describe brmbrmcar test. It might work online.
[2015/11/22 13:41:58] <Hume2> That doesn't work too: Unknown command DESCRIBE
[2015/11/22 13:42:26] <mt> /describe and /me are client specific
[2015/11/22 13:42:30] <mt> as is /ctcp
[2015/11/22 13:42:46] <mt> this is basically just a PRIVMSG

[2015/11/22 14:36:53] <Karkus> leyyin: I mean, metaphorically. They make you work very hard, don't they?
[2015/11/22 14:37:07] <leyyin> you work as much as you want ;)
[2015/11/22 14:37:16] <leyyin> they do not track you in the office

[2015/11/22 14:37:57] <Karkus> Can you work from home?
[2015/11/22 14:38:04] <leyyin> on some days yes

[2015/11/22 14:38:35] <leyyin> so I am not sure
[2015/11/22 14:38:48] <Karkus> leyyin: I don't understand...
[2015/11/22 14:38:50] <leyyin> Karkus, do you want to work for Google?
[2015/11/22 14:39:12] <brmbrmcar> I hate Google.

[2015/11/22 14:42:49] <brmbrmcar> I'll get Chrome OS to run all file types, hey? No chance.
[2015/11/22 14:42:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: That's how I got my Mozilla internship.
[2015/11/22 14:43:05] <leyyin> Tobbi, by being a slacker? :P
[2015/11/22 14:43:06] <brmbrmcar> I am not considering it at this stage.
[2015/11/22 14:43:34] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, I contributed constantly for around 3 years or so.
[2015/11/22 14:43:42] <Karkus> Also, does (open source = insecure)?
[2015/11/22 14:44:16] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: But you never implemented MNG support.
[2015/11/22 14:44:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: Worked your metaphorical socks off
[2015/11/22 14:44:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: You're aware of the fact that open source means more people take a look at the code, right?
[2015/11/22 14:44:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, I did.
[2015/11/22 14:44:46] <leyyin> well my dream would be to work on an open source product and be paid for it :P
[2015/11/22 14:44:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: I reckon I'm aware of that
[2015/11/22 14:44:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: Aka Mozilla.
[2015/11/22 14:45:07] <Karkus> leyyin: This exists
[2015/11/22 14:45:15] <Karkus> Android?
[2015/11/22 14:45:21] <leyyin> Tobbi, mozilla is going down the shit drain
[2015/11/22 14:45:41] <brmbrmcar> Android is not open source! But it is free!
[2015/11/22 14:45:43] <leyyin> I still read the new glassdoor reviews :P

[2015/11/22 14:46:00] <Tobbi> leyyin: there are new?
[2015/11/22 14:46:21] <leyyin> Karkus, well, they develop their new android version closed at first, but they release a new version down and there
[2015/11/22 14:46:26] <leyyin> under an open source license
[2015/11/22 14:46:27] <brmbrmcar> Well, show me the source for Android.
[2015/11/22 14:46:49] <Karkus> leyyin: But if you've got it on your phone, you can get the code.
[2015/11/22 14:46:49] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, heard of custom roms?
[2015/11/22 14:46:50] <brmbrmcar> And, if people pay for it, they get a nasty bonus.
[2015/11/22 14:46:57] <brmbrmcar> Yeah
[2015/11/22 14:47:09] * Tobbi opens up glassdoor.com
[2015/11/22 14:47:11] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, how do they do it, the custom roms, without the source code?
[2015/11/22 14:47:20] <brmbrmcar> Er...
[2015/11/22 14:47:28] <brmbrmcar> But then there is no cost!
[2015/11/22 14:47:35] <brmbrmcar> That is a different thing!
[2015/11/22 14:47:38] <leyyin> what?

[2015/11/22 14:48:56] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Android must be open source, as it is based off Linux
[2015/11/22 14:49:12] <leyyin> Karkus, *the kernel must be open source
[2015/11/22 14:49:17] <Karkus> The question is, does that mean that it is by definition less secure than iOS
[2015/11/22 14:49:27] <brmbrmcar> Where does the thing actually show the code?
[2015/11/22 14:49:27] <leyyin> any other part is not mandatory to be open source
[2015/11/22 14:49:30] <Tobbi> leyyin: The reviews are not *that* bad.
[2015/11/22 14:49:40] <Karkus> leyyin: It gets too complex for me.
[2015/11/22 14:49:50] <Karkus> All I know- GPL is infective
[2015/11/22 14:49:51] <Tobbi> I mean. There are 3 and 4 star reviews among them.

[2015/11/22 14:50:27] <Karkus> I have no idea how people work with code bases as huge as that...
[2015/11/22 14:50:28] <brmbrmcar> Ah. OK.
[2015/11/22 14:50:36] <brmbrmcar> Where do they charge then?

[2015/11/22 14:50:46] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, charge what?

[2015/11/22 14:51:43] <brmbrmcar> Like, what is the point of charging for it if someone can just git clone it?
[2015/11/22 14:51:51] <leyyin> ahem
[2015/11/22 14:51:59] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, who charges for android?
[2015/11/22 14:52:06] <Karkus> ...
[2015/11/22 14:52:07] <leyyin> android does not cost money....
[2015/11/22 14:52:27] <leyyin> I know a piece of software that is GPL (open source) and costs money

[2015/11/22 14:52:48] <Karkus> leyyin: ReTux :P
[2015/11/22 14:53:39] <brmbrmcar> Oh, Retux. I tried cracking it, but after about 200 minutes realised that it was going to take days, not minutes.
[2015/11/22 14:54:06] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Or years...
[2015/11/22 14:54:13] <brmbrmcar> Yes.

[2015/11/22 14:54:31] <Tobbi> Or millennia...
[2015/11/22 14:54:42] <brmbrmcar> I thought that it would dive in to the archive and just extract the thing.

[2015/11/23 09:08:52] <grumbel> The general syntax is '(section (name value) (name value) ...)'
[2015/11/23 09:08:57] <grumbel> "section" is array[0]
[2015/11/23 09:09:05] <grumbel> "(name value)" is array[1]

[2015/11/23 09:10:53] <Tobbi> grumbel: Could we potentially have the parsing on a different thread?
[2015/11/23 09:12:21] <grumbel> Tobbi: not easily, Level loading right now triggers Tilemap loading that triggers OpenGL and OpenGL isn't happy when two threads access it
[2015/11/23 09:16:39] <grumbel> The initial worldmap loading could be spread across threads, as that isn't even using the regular Level loading

[2015/11/23 10:58:40] <leper`> Tobbi: Are you for hire? I might need sfx in a few other chans in case you are and you don't want to be paid in real money.
[2015/11/23 10:59:05] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 10:59:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: What does he want? I don't understand his english. :)
[2015/11/23 10:59:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: You may have gotten youself a job. :F
[2015/11/23 10:59:57] <head8debian> :D*
[2015/11/23 11:00:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's rude to talk about someone else in the third person.
[2015/11/23 11:00:18] <head8debian> It is?
[2015/11/23 11:00:22] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/23 11:00:26] <head8debian> Sorry leper`.
[2015/11/23 11:00:37] * head8debian is being nosey...
[2015/11/23 11:00:45] <brmbrmcar> Has head8debian been naughty?
[2015/11/23 11:00:51] * head8debian nods...
[2015/11/23 11:01:03] <head8debian> Hehe.
[2015/11/23 11:01:06] <leper`> head8debian: they also told me it's rude to talk about onself in the third person
[2015/11/23 11:01:29] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Saturday detention!
[2015/11/23 11:01:35] <head8debian> And why did "they" tell you that? :-)
[2015/11/23 11:01:41] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: From what?
[2015/11/23 11:02:04] <brmbrmcar> You being rude.
[2015/11/23 11:02:07] <Tobbi> Alright, that's enough.
[2015/11/23 11:02:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes it is.
[2015/11/23 11:02:34] <head8debian> Sorry.

[2015/11/23 11:03:34] <brmbrmcar> back to my?
[2015/11/23 11:03:35] * head8debian bangs his head on the table...
[2015/11/23 11:03:50] <leper`> head8debian: hm, someone should have asked them that before we got them decapitated
[2015/11/23 11:05:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why don't you bang someone / something else?
[2015/11/23 11:05:57] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/23 11:06:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: ...
[2015/11/23 11:06:39] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:07:37] <leper`> Tobbi: You're having a blast, aren't you?
[2015/11/23 11:07:50] <Tobbi> leper`: What?
[2015/11/23 11:08:15] <leper`> and I thought you wanted to continue with the drum puns
[2015/11/23 11:08:19] <head8debian> leper`: Haha. He always does teasing me. :)
[2015/11/23 11:08:42] <leper`> you mean he's beating the head8drum again?
[2015/11/23 11:08:51] <head8debian> He sure is not the young grouch i first thought he was. :p
[2015/11/23 11:09:15] <leper`> I guess he showed you some id :P
[2015/11/23 11:09:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Any chocolate show up from that guy yet? :D
[2015/11/23 11:09:44] <Tobbi> leper`: Oh!
[2015/11/23 11:09:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: Nope.
[2015/11/23 11:09:50] <head8debian> :(
[2015/11/23 11:09:56] <head8debian> Slow air mail.
[2015/11/23 11:09:58] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/23 11:10:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh c'mon.
[2015/11/23 11:10:11] <Tobbi> I should've never given him my mailing address...
[2015/11/23 11:10:23] <brmbrmcar> Air mail?
[2015/11/23 11:10:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im joking!
[2015/11/23 11:10:28] <leper`> I'd have sent you a picture of chocolate
[2015/11/23 11:10:30] <Tobbi> I know, it's right.
[2015/11/23 11:12:05] <brmbrmcar> Where are the links to the Supertux social stuff you did yesterday?
[2015/11/23 11:13:03] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: https://twitter.com/supertux_team
[2015/11/23 11:13:51] <brmbrmcar> And...
[2015/11/23 11:14:56] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: And what? Thats it ATM.
[2015/11/23 11:15:18] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: If you get us some live footage of you playing supertux i will make a video.
[2015/11/23 11:15:35] <head8debian> I dont have enough GPU power to record and play.
[2015/11/23 11:15:48] @ Quit: brmbrmcar: Quit: Lost terminal
[2015/11/23 11:15:50] <leper`> head8debian: guess I'll get someone to make out twitter account follow yours or something
[2015/11/23 11:15:52] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/11/23 11:16:22] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why did you call brmbrmcar an ATM?
[2015/11/23 11:16:27] <Tobbi> He doesn't look like an ATM.
[2015/11/23 11:16:29] <Tobbi> Not by far.
[2015/11/23 11:16:36] <Tobbi> Actually, guess I cannot know that.
[2015/11/23 11:17:11] <leper`> Tobbi: but if he looks like an ATM that might help with getting money
[2015/11/23 11:17:19] <Tobbi> leper`: Or losing it again...
[2015/11/23 11:17:21] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:17:41] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/23 11:17:52] <leper`> you do use the ATM wrong in that case

[2015/11/23 11:19:32] <leper`> WHAT?
[2015/11/23 11:19:50] <brmbrmcar> Twitter is evil.
[2015/11/23 11:20:11] <leper`> and?
[2015/11/23 11:20:30] <brmbrmcar> It overloaded crouton.
[2015/11/23 11:20:55] <leper`> whatever that is
[2015/11/23 11:20:56] <brmbrmcar> That page was more than id
[2015/11/23 11:21:04] <brmbrmcar> is left in my SSD.
[2015/11/23 11:21:08] <head8debian> leper`: Its a tasty treat for a salad.
[2015/11/23 11:21:22] <Tobbi> Indeed.
[2015/11/23 11:21:28] <Tobbi> I like Croutons  as well.

[2015/11/23 11:22:01] <brmbrmcar> I mean the thing for Chromebooks.
[2015/11/23 11:22:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: We have gotten about 6 inches of snow. o_O And its makign a huge mess since its not freezing out.
[2015/11/23 11:22:19] <brmbrmcar> I want an external HDD.
[2015/11/23 11:22:27] <head8debian> leper`: On salad? Meh.
[2015/11/23 11:22:34] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: You are so lucky!
[2015/11/23 11:22:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: Really? We haven't gotten any more snow.
[2015/11/23 11:22:42] <leper`> you don't have to have the salad
[2015/11/23 11:22:49] <head8debian> leper`: On brocolli salad, yum! :D
[2015/11/23 11:22:51] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Could it be that you're slightly autistic?
[2015/11/23 11:23:06] <head8debian> I hate snow. I have to work in it. :D
[2015/11/23 11:23:07] <brmbrmcar> What?
[2015/11/23 11:23:17] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Know what autism is?
[2015/11/23 11:23:32] <Tobbi> if not, never mind.

[2015/11/23 11:23:44] <brmbrmcar> yeah.
[2015/11/23 11:24:04] <Tobbi> leper`: hah. I didn't even think about that.
[2015/11/23 11:24:18] <leper`> I know, that's why I'm here
[2015/11/23 11:28:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: [Ar] 4d9. :D

[2015/11/23 11:28:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: If you give me you address i may give you a pack of resistors for christmas. :D
[2015/11/23 11:28:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: Isnt that Copper?
[2015/11/23 11:29:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why would I want resistors?
[2015/11/23 11:29:21] <leper`> to join the resistance
[2015/11/23 11:29:31] <Tobbi> leper`: Bad pun...

[2015/11/23 11:30:31] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:30:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about chocolate?
[2015/11/23 11:30:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:30:53] <Tobbi> I'd prefer chocolate over anything else.
[2015/11/23 11:31:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: If i can ship chocolate from amazon, sure...
[2015/11/23 11:31:23] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:31:26] <Tobbi> Doubt it

[2015/11/23 11:33:07] <head8debian> Heh.

[2015/11/23 11:34:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why not? Google Security Bug Bounty is almost cheap.
[2015/11/23 11:34:01] <Tobbi> Almost.

[2015/11/23 11:37:10] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I remember the days when Mozilla only paid 500 USD per security issues.
[2015/11/23 11:37:12] <Tobbi> Those days...
[2015/11/23 11:37:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Money inflation...
[2015/11/23 11:37:31] <brmbrmcar> Ah, so I'd better hack Chrome.
[2015/11/23 11:37:31] <Tobbi> I could've gotten 15K instead of only 1.5K
[2015/11/23 11:37:33] <head8debian> Welcome Hume2 and Karkus!
[2015/11/23 11:37:44] <Tobbi> Or rather, 9K
[2015/11/23 11:37:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: you got anything at all?
[2015/11/23 11:37:48] <Hume2> Hi, head8debian.
[2015/11/23 11:38:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: I go 1.5K for 2 security bugs (+ helping QA 1)
[2015/11/23 11:38:28] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2015/11/23 11:38:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: They pay you if you fix a security issue?
[2015/11/23 11:38:40] <Tobbi> That was back in the old days...
[2015/11/23 11:38:44] <brmbrmcar> Like ReTux.
[2015/11/23 11:38:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: Fix??? No, find! :D
[2015/11/23 11:38:58] <Tobbi> Mozilla, that is.
[2015/11/23 11:39:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: O.o
[2015/11/23 11:39:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: But that was in 2010...or so...
[2015/11/23 11:39:19] <Tobbi> So 5 years ago...time flies.
[2015/11/23 11:39:32] <Karkus> When you're having fun?
[2015/11/23 11:39:44] <Tobbi> Karkus: somewhat :P
[2015/11/23 11:39:44] <brmbrmcar> If Microsoft gave out money for this they'd be bankrupt.
[2015/11/23 11:39:56] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Yup
[2015/11/23 11:39:57] <Hume2> :DDDDDDD
[2015/11/23 11:40:13] <brmbrmcar> Same goes for Apple.
[2015/11/23 11:40:20] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: They do: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dn425055.aspx
[2015/11/23 11:40:53] <head8debian> Does this link work for anyone? http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/periodic_table/chemical_symbols.html
[2015/11/23 11:41:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2010-34/
[2015/11/23 11:41:25] <brmbrmcar> But they don't pay, they just use other free rewards.
[2015/11/23 11:41:32] <Tobbi> Also https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2009-45/
[2015/11/23 11:41:48] <brmbrmcar> Which is how Microsoft is still in business.
[2015/11/23 11:42:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: I can file a security report against microsoft! Windows is a complete vunerablity! There. :D
[2015/11/23 11:42:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: That will likely not work...
[2015/11/23 11:42:39] <Hume2> It's a spyware.
[2015/11/23 11:42:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: No, probably not.
[2015/11/23 11:42:51] <Tobbi> head8debian: Also, that's not a bug but intended behaviour.
[2015/11/23 11:42:55] <Tobbi> Thus, no $$$
[2015/11/23 11:43:21] <Hume2> Windows 10 is a spyware. If you had another spyware on your computer, you would solve it.
[2015/11/23 11:43:21] <Karkus> I will just say there's a virus on my computer, and show them the fix of formatting the partition
[2015/11/23 11:43:22] <brmbrmcar> Or alternatively I could actually hackWindows and they might not press charges when I tell them the issue.
[2015/11/23 11:43:44] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:44:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, WIndows 10 give me adware, so its bugged somehow. :D
[2015/11/23 11:44:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Still intended behaviour
[2015/11/23 11:44:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: I know, i know. :)
[2015/11/23 11:44:52] <head8debian> Sorry Microsoft, im giving you a hard time.
[2015/11/23 11:45:02] <head8debian> Its hard to please everyone these days.
[2015/11/23 11:45:17] <Hume2> ᑎ	̲
[2015/11/23 11:45:29] <head8debian> You either have people who hate it or love it...
[2015/11/23 11:45:33] <brmbrmcar> Highlighter!
[2015/11/23 11:46:05] <Tobbi> Hume2: ?
[2015/11/23 11:46:17] <Karkus> head8debian: You're mixing up Marmite with Microsoft. Everyone hates Microsoft.
[2015/11/23 11:46:18] <Hume2> It was just an unicode test.
[2015/11/23 11:47:01] <head8debian> I don't hate Microsoft, i hate Windows. :)
[2015/11/23 11:47:12] <brmbrmcar> Everyone hates Microsoft! Apart from peple who don't!
[2015/11/23 11:47:20] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2015/11/23 11:47:21] <head8debian> I don't *hate* windows, just prefer not to use it.
[2015/11/23 11:47:25] <brmbrmcar> I hate Microsoft.
[2015/11/23 11:47:52] <brmbrmcar> All of Microsoft's money is fromindows.
[2015/11/23 11:47:52] <Hume2> Do never do any banking stuff on Windows 10.
[2015/11/23 11:48:10] <brmbrmcar> Never do any banking stuff onWindows.
[2015/11/23 11:48:34] <brmbrmcar> Any Windows.
[2015/11/23 11:48:37] <head8debian> And why not? Its still encrypted with HTTPS.
[2015/11/23 11:48:45] <Karkus> Key logger.
[2015/11/23 11:48:57] <Hume2> They send the keybord input.
[2015/11/23 11:49:17] <head8debian> Well try disabling Cortana...
[2015/11/23 11:49:22] <Karkus> Then again, Google does it too.
[2015/11/23 11:49:29] <Hume2> So you have to make a macro that changes the nubres, i.e. you press 1 and it writes 3.
[2015/11/23 11:49:31] <Karkus> With all of its products

[2015/11/23 11:50:52] <brmbrmcar> Actually, I think I have an idea for a fake terminal.
[2015/11/23 11:51:21] <brmbrmcar> Especially easy onWindows, although I did make my computer vunerable.
[2015/11/23 11:51:24] <head8debian> I prefer real terminals.
[2015/11/23 11:52:00] <brmbrmcar> No, you change the input, and display what you actually typed.
[2015/11/23 11:54:45] <brmbrmcar> Nice?
[2015/11/23 11:55:01] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/23 11:55:13] <Hume2> Hmmm...
[2015/11/23 11:55:54] <leper`> head8debian: got you followed
[2015/11/23 11:56:00] <head8debian> leper`: What?
[2015/11/23 11:56:10] <leper`> meaning I told someone to follow you
[2015/11/23 11:56:50] <leper`> (that doesn't really answer your question, does it?)
[2015/11/23 11:56:53] <head8debian> leper`: Follow me on what?
[2015/11/23 11:57:12] <head8debian> leper`: I don't have a twitter account.
[2015/11/23 11:57:35] <head8debian> Good luck finding me on other social media sites.
[2015/11/23 11:57:44] <leper`> might have been a plural you ;-)
[2015/11/23 11:57:57] <leper`> (and you posted a twitter thingy above)
[2015/11/23 11:58:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: OUR TEAM twitter, ffs.
[2015/11/23 11:58:17] <head8debian> leper`: oh, OUR team? Its not *me*!
[2015/11/23 11:58:21] <brmbrmcar> Was there a Supertux Youtube account?
[2015/11/23 11:58:44] <head8debian> There is, but its empty.
[2015/11/23 11:59:28] <leper`> head8debian: yes, but some things also work for the plural case, and pinging roughly a third of the channel is rude
[2015/11/23 11:59:33] <brmbrmcar> Link for it?
[2015/11/23 11:59:38] <head8debian> leper`: :)
[2015/11/23 11:59:55] <leyyin> hmm leper` is here too
[2015/11/23 11:59:58] <leper`> but I guess I can try
[2015/11/23 12:00:03] <leyyin> can't go on freenode without this guy around :P
[2015/11/23 12:00:21] <leper`> Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: head8debian told me to ping everyone
[2015/11/23 12:00:29] <head8debian> leper`: I wish some people knew that its rude to ping half the channel...
[2015/11/23 12:00:34] <Tobbi> leper`: I don't suffer from MPD
[2015/11/23 12:00:41] <Hume2> Does anyone have an access to the SuperTux Youtube account?
[2015/11/23 12:00:48] <leper`> music player daemon?
[2015/11/23 12:00:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Should we give hum access?
[2015/11/23 12:00:55] <brmbrmcar> Come on, a link for the YouTube page? Are you guys torturing me?
[2015/11/23 12:00:58] <head8debian> Hume2*
[2015/11/23 12:01:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: If he doesn't wreck it...
[2015/11/23 12:01:14] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: There isn o channel currently!
[2015/11/23 12:01:15] <leper`> leyyin: any channels you're on and I'm not?
[2015/11/23 12:01:18] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You're torturing yourself enough.
[2015/11/23 12:01:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes or no?
[2015/11/23 12:01:30] <Tobbi> head8debian: If he doesn't wreck it.
[2015/11/23 12:01:30] <brmbrmcar> Thank you, head8debian.
[2015/11/23 12:01:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: lOL. :)
[2015/11/23 12:01:39] <leper`> (also we do need Arthur_* in here)
[2015/11/23 12:01:52] <Tobbi> Hume2: Will you wreck the youtube channel?
[2015/11/23 12:02:08] <head8debian> Hume2: Do you promise to not wreck our accounts if i give you the info to log into them? :) And promise to not change the password?
[2015/11/23 12:02:14] <leyyin> leper`, #unknown-horizons ;)
[2015/11/23 12:02:39] <Hume2> Do I look like I wreck channels on purpose?
[2015/11/23 12:02:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: Plus, promise not to upload any videos of you dancing naked in the shower?
[2015/11/23 12:02:42] <brmbrmcar> What's evil about Hume2?
[2015/11/23 12:02:56] <Tobbi> Not even with a geo 3corners...
[2015/11/23 12:03:10] <leper`> leyyin: I take it that is the full list :P
[2015/11/23 12:03:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: That is the worst joke i have ever heard out of you.
[2015/11/23 12:03:22] <leper`> (haven't played that in ages, not really my kind of game)
[2015/11/23 12:03:24] <head8debian> Hume2: We are joking. :)

[2015/11/23 12:13:29] <brmbrmcar> What is the difference between giby and giby_the_kid?
[2015/11/23 12:13:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: No, Access.

[2015/11/23 12:13:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/23 12:14:00] <brmbrmcar> Are they the same person?
[2015/11/23 12:14:13] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: YES!
[2015/11/23 12:14:31] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/23 12:14:42] <head8debian> usually head8debian and head8deb1an are the same person also!
[2015/11/23 12:15:38] <head8debian> One could be my goat, you never know. :D

[2015/11/23 12:19:28] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Oops.
[2015/11/23 12:19:34] <head8debian> benjamin__: Are you connecting from your home?
[2015/11/23 12:20:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: giby has alot of open ports on his network. o_O
[2015/11/23 12:20:19] <Tobbi> ...
[2015/11/23 12:20:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats your IP address so i can scan your network? :D
[2015/11/23 12:20:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do I want that?
[2015/11/23 12:20:56] <head8debian> Just keeping us safe. :D
[2015/11/23 12:21:06] <head8debian> You can scan mine all you want.
[2015/11/23 12:21:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: PM
[2015/11/23 12:21:21] <head8debian> Unless my ISP hacked in and set up port forwarding...
[2015/11/23 12:29:34] <brmbrmcar> I am conecting from home.
[2015/11/23 12:30:51] <head8debian> I wish i had my own IP address.
[2015/11/23 12:30:54] * head8debian cries...
[2015/11/23 12:31:01] <brmbrmcar> I want my own IP.
[2015/11/23 12:31:24] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: You probably can. I cannot.
[2015/11/23 12:31:31] <brmbrmcar> 4913.4913.4913.4913, but they would never allow one that long. :(
[2015/11/23 12:31:37] <brmbrmcar> How?
[2015/11/23 12:32:18] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Look it up.
[2015/11/23 12:32:30] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: 999.999.999 is the biggest IPV4 can handle.
[2015/11/23 12:32:34] <head8debian> Wait.
[2015/11/23 12:32:40] <head8debian> 999.999.999.999.
[2015/11/23 12:32:41] <head8debian> There.
[2015/11/23 12:32:53] <brmbrmcar> I just tried.
[2015/11/23 12:33:10] <brmbrmcar> But I cannot find anything part from my public IP.
[2015/11/23 12:33:40] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Don't worry about it. If you don't know what exactly you are doing you can open gateways for hackers to walk right in and hack your computer.
[2015/11/23 12:34:02] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: And you have no need for it.
[2015/11/23 12:34:17] <leper`> head8debian: Did you mean 255?
[2015/11/23 12:34:20] <Hume2> head8debian: No, biggest is 255.255.255.255.
[2015/11/23 12:34:29] <leper`> or are you working for CSI?
[2015/11/23 12:34:36] <brmbrmcar> And I can only change my settings through Chrome OS.
[2015/11/23 12:34:51] <Hume2> You can use IP changer.
[2015/11/23 12:35:30] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but that won't work for me.
[2015/11/23 12:35:42] <head8debian> I figured it was 255, but i thought 999 sounded cool. I was referencing to it being 3x4 digits long...
[2015/11/23 12:35:51] <leyyin> lemme write a visual basic program to trace your IP
[2015/11/23 12:35:53] <head8debian> 4x3. whatever.
[2015/11/23 12:36:06] <leyyin> *visual basic GUI
[2015/11/23 12:36:06] <leper`> wasn't that s/program/gui/?
[2015/11/23 12:36:07] <head8debian> Why not traceroute? :)
[2015/11/23 12:36:29] <leper`> head8debian: You're no real hacker if you do that
[2015/11/23 12:36:38] <head8debian> Im not a real hacker!
[2015/11/23 12:36:49] <leyyin> yes, head8debian you are on a list now, FBI most likely ;)
[2015/11/23 12:36:50] <head8debian> I just want to keep people out of *my* hair.
[2015/11/23 12:37:02] <head8debian> Huh?
[2015/11/23 12:37:04] <leper`> then go bald
[2015/11/23 12:37:06] <leper`> er bold!
[2015/11/23 12:37:36] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/11/23 12:37:48] <head8debian> I am, i have no IP address, and cannot get one. :D
[2015/11/23 12:37:56] <head8debian> I cannot even get a IPV6 tunnel...
[2015/11/23 12:38:12] <brmbrmcar> You have anIP address.
[2015/11/23 12:38:17] <brmbrmcar> Everyone does.
[2015/11/23 12:38:50] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, I don't
[2015/11/23 12:38:55] <leyyin> I live in the ether of the internet
[2015/11/23 12:38:59] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: No, not everyone.
[2015/11/23 12:39:03] <head8debian> leper`: ether?
[2015/11/23 12:39:05] <leper`> get some cheap vps? (then forward)
[2015/11/23 12:39:07] <head8debian> leyyin: ^
[2015/11/23 12:39:09] <leper`> lol
[2015/11/23 12:39:16] <head8debian> To much money. :D
[2015/11/23 12:39:17] <leper`> head8debian: something you can sniff
[2015/11/23 12:39:19] <brmbrmcar> So if you were to takeyour cloak off, what would it say?
[2015/11/23 12:39:19] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/23 12:39:28] <mt> >Too much money
[2015/11/23 12:39:32] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: My ISPs IP address.
[2015/11/23 12:39:37] <mt> You can get VPSes for $15/year
[2015/11/23 12:39:41] <brmbrmcar> Like for me.
[2015/11/23 12:39:44] <head8debian> Its not too much money, but my parents won't let me.
[2015/11/23 12:40:04] <head8debian> My ISP feeds a couple hundred people on 2 IP addresses.
[2015/11/23 12:40:13] <brmbrmcar> Poor head8debian.
[2015/11/23 12:40:19] <leper`> mt: possibly less if you have some .edu email
[2015/11/23 12:40:21] <Hume2> I tried some on-line IP tracking stuff and any of them could trace me correctly.
[2015/11/23 12:41:18] <brmbrmcar> Not for me.
[2015/11/23 12:42:08] <head8debian> There are people who want a IP address and cannot have one and there are people who have one and dont have a clue that theyt have one.
[2015/11/23 12:42:24] @ Wuzzy joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/23 12:43:46] <brmbrmcar> Then steal one from the people who do not know. :D
[2015/11/23 12:44:17] <mt> but seriously - CGNAT and no IPv6
[2015/11/23 12:44:31] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Thats kinda hard.
[2015/11/23 12:44:57] <brmbrmcar> I was joking.
[2015/11/23 12:45:32] <mt> >kinda hard - get some bgp peering w/o prefix filtering and announce a route
[2015/11/23 12:46:07] <head8debian> mt: What?
[2015/11/23 12:46:08] <brmbrmcar> How do you get whatever IP you eant for free?
[2015/11/23 12:46:17] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: You don't.
[2015/11/23 12:46:18] <brmbrmcar> Without any software?
[2015/11/23 12:46:28] * brmbrmcar cries
[2015/11/23 12:47:12] @ Quit: Tobbi: Remote host closed the connection
[2015/11/23 12:47:57] <mt> well
[2015/11/23 12:48:03] <mt> you can leak a BGP route
[2015/11/23 12:48:58] <head8debian> mt: I think i can survive with it the way it is. :)
[2015/11/23 12:49:07] <head8debian> I have no one's IP address to use anyways.
[2015/11/23 12:49:20] <head8debian> All my relatives use the same ISP.
[2015/11/23 12:50:10] <mt> when you leak a route you usually do that without the owner's permission
[2015/11/23 12:50:11] <brmbrmcar> That is annoying.
[2015/11/23 12:50:36] <head8debian> mt: Ok, then im *NOT* doing it.
[2015/11/23 12:50:38] <head8debian> :)
[2015/11/23 12:51:05] <mt> you can't anyway without a BGP session
[2015/11/23 12:51:53] <mt> and there's ROA to prevent bad announcements as well
[2015/11/23 12:52:11] <mt> however, it can happen that ISPs leak routes they're not supposed to announce
[2015/11/23 12:52:30] <mt> and even if that's a one-person ISP it can actually take down entire Google
[2015/11/23 12:52:45] <brmbrmcar> Awesome!
[2015/11/23 12:52:52] <brmbrmcar> Can you do that?
[2015/11/23 12:53:03] <leper`> head8debian: in case you have an .edu email https://education.github.com/pack and the digitalocean thing might help you for some time
[2015/11/23 12:53:12] <mt> I don't have any BGP sessions in the real internet
[2015/11/23 12:53:22] <head8debian> leper`: .edu email?
[2015/11/23 12:53:25] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2015/11/23 12:53:33] <leper`> as in school
[2015/11/23 12:53:43] <head8debian> No i don't have one.
[2015/11/23 12:53:44] <mt> leper`: you don't even need an .edu address if you can send them a copy of your student ID iirc
[2015/11/23 12:53:54] <leper`> never got that far
[2015/11/23 12:54:04] <head8debian> Whats a student id?
[2015/11/23 12:54:11] <brmbrmcar> What is a Student ID?
[2015/11/23 12:54:25] <brmbrmcar> oops
[2015/11/23 12:54:42] <mt> "Please upload an image of your school ID, academic transcript, or other proof of affiliation. Please make sure dates are visible, verifying your status as a current student."
[2015/11/23 12:55:08] <brmbrmcar> I have none of that.
[2015/11/23 12:55:24] <head8debian> nm...
[2015/11/23 12:55:25] <mt> that shows up if you select "I don't have a school-issued email"
[2015/11/23 12:56:21] <mt> and - any high school, university, college, etc should actually be able to provide you a 'proof of affiliation', as in a proof that you visit a state-recognized school
[2015/11/23 12:56:36] <head8debian> mt: Im Homeschooled.
[2015/11/23 12:57:21] <mt> americans...
[2015/11/23 12:57:24] <leyyin> :D
[2015/11/23 12:57:38] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Is that good?
[2015/11/23 12:58:05] <mt> head8debian: but don't you have to write tests or so that proof that you actually get enough education?
[2015/11/23 12:59:48] <leyyin> I have no idea what you are talking about mt, all this network stuff :P, too low level
[2015/11/23 13:00:21] <leyyin> I never heard of BGP before, TIL
[2015/11/23 13:00:49] <head8debian> mt: In a way, yes.
[2015/11/23 13:01:00] <head8debian> leper`: Me neither...
[2015/11/23 13:01:04] <head8debian> leyyin: ^.
[2015/11/23 13:01:10] <head8debian> leper`: Sorry!
[2015/11/23 13:01:21] <head8debian> leper`: Your names are too close. :)
[2015/11/23 13:01:23] <mt> imagine manually entering all the 500000 IPv4 routes using `ip route add ...` :>
[2015/11/23 13:01:34] <brmbrmcar> I feel like I want to blow up my school.
[2015/11/23 13:01:58] <head8debian> mt: SOunds fun....

[2015/11/23 13:02:37] <leper`> leyyin: sounds more like a rural area
[2015/11/23 13:02:47] <Tobbi> Romania is a rural area.

[2015/11/23 13:03:04] <leper`> with possibly non-wired connection to some place that has a wire
[2015/11/23 13:03:04] <leyyin> Tobbi, it is :D, only 50% of people live in cities
[2015/11/23 13:03:06] <mt> I actually understand ISPs doing CGNAT here in Germany, but those who do provide static IPv6 /64 (or was it /56)
[2015/11/23 13:03:12] <head8debian> leper`: Maybe. I do appear to have an IP address, but no controll over it.
[2015/11/23 13:03:19] <leper`> Tobbi: but one with sane prices for internet
[2015/11/23 13:03:22] <leper`> (or beer)
[2015/11/23 13:03:25] <leper`> (or food)
[2015/11/23 13:03:32] <leyyin> leper`, one word, Romania ;)
[2015/11/23 13:03:41] <brmbrmcar> Do you only drink beer?
[2015/11/23 13:03:50] <head8debian> This is rural. :D
[2015/11/23 13:03:50] <leper`> they prefer blood
[2015/11/23 13:03:59] <leper`> but they do have beer to lure tourists there
[2015/11/23 13:04:06] <leyyin> true, true
[2015/11/23 13:04:16] <brmbrmcar> Blood?
[2015/11/23 13:04:20] <head8debian> I cannot get a wired internet conection here except for dialup. :D
[2015/11/23 13:04:28] <leper`> mt: /56, else you should complain
[2015/11/23 13:04:46] <head8debian> Im having trouble understanding subnets...
[2015/11/23 13:05:26] <leper`> leyyin: you should really read about bgp (mostly about the fun things one can do with that, or why your packets to the country next door are going via some other 2 continents)
[2015/11/23 13:06:12] <head8debian> Sounds interesting.
[2015/11/23 13:07:06] <leyyin> well I am reading now on wikipedia
[2015/11/23 13:07:23] <mt> btw, @German-speaking people: http://www.daserste.de/information/reportage-dokumentation/citizenfour/index.html
[2015/11/23 13:07:41] <leyyin> seems weird that such a fundamental protocol is in the application layer ;)
[2015/11/23 13:09:01] <head8debian> The more studying i do on networking the less i realize i know...
[2015/11/23 13:09:27] <leyyin> oh boy, On August 12, outages resulting from full tables hit Ebay, Lastpass and the Microsoft Cloud among others,[24] which TheRegister dubbed 512KDay.
[2015/11/23 13:09:58] <leyyin> it seems to me this is routing tables protocol for large networks :P
[2015/11/23 13:10:03] <head8debian> And we never noticed. :D
[2015/11/23 13:10:55] <Tobbi> mt: Ja, nee, das muss jetzt nicht sein. Hast du nicht irgendwas über Meerschweinchen, die sich durch Aufnahme von Smarties in eine Discokugel verwandelt haben oder so?
[2015/11/23 13:11:13] * leyyin needs to learn german on duolingo
[2015/11/23 13:11:16] <Tobbi> (Ich weiß, die armen Smarties)
[2015/11/23 13:11:48] <leyyin> Tobbi, "Yes, no, that does not have to be. Have not you anything about guinea pigs who have turned to oral administration of Smarties in a disco ball or something?"
[2015/11/23 13:11:49] <leyyin> wtf?
[2015/11/23 13:11:57] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes!
[2015/11/23 13:11:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 13:12:38] <Tobbi> leyyin: Von oben betrachtet sehen Smarties und Discokugeln ja sowieso quasi identisch aus.
[2015/11/23 13:13:15] <leyyin> Tobbi, das Rauchen Unkraut Mann
[2015/11/23 13:13:24] <Tobbi> leyyin: hahah...
[2015/11/23 13:13:31] <Tobbi> leyyin: Fail!
[2015/11/23 13:14:00] <Tobbi> Unkraut != Cannabis.
[2015/11/23 13:14:23] <leyyin> I listen to google
[2015/11/23 13:14:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: And Google listens to you?
[2015/11/23 13:14:50] <leyyin> of course not
[2015/11/23 13:14:53] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 13:14:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: But google listens to your telephone calls...
[2015/11/23 13:15:16] <leyyin> sure....
[2015/11/23 13:15:18] <Hume2> It's imperialistic...
[2015/11/23 13:16:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: "Ich kenn keine Angst und kein Erbarmen, keine Gnade, wenn ich an mein Schienbein fasse, denk ich oft an meine Wade"

[2015/11/24 11:24:03] <Tobbi> maths22: How would you do that? The menu file in which the logo is defined doesn't support #if since it's not c++
[2015/11/24 11:24:03] <brmbrmcar> Is that a good idea?
[2015/11/24 11:24:32] <maths22> Tobbi: We use a CMake .in file

[2015/11/24 11:25:01] <maths22> Duplicating code (or levels) is a bad idea because then only 1 will get changed

[2015/11/24 11:25:42] <maths22> Where is the logic for that?

[2015/11/24 11:27:40] <brmbrmcar> maths22: OK.
[2015/11/24 11:27:54] <brmbrmcar> But we don't want it to bug up.
[2015/11/24 11:28:00] <maths22> brmbrmcar: of course
[2015/11/24 11:28:51] <brmbrmcar> So I probably wouldn't want to implement anything until after 0.4.0.
[2015/11/24 11:29:31] <Tobbi> ...unless those are really minor changes that won't break.
[2015/11/24 11:29:54] <brmbrmcar> But best be on the safe side.

[2015/11/24 14:33:59] <maths22> mt: Great
[2015/11/24 14:34:12] <maths22> I just figured having 3 copies of the main level is not a good idea
[2015/11/24 14:34:25] <maths22> It also meant that, during christmas time, the development logo would not be used
[2015/11/24 14:34:29] <brmbrmcar> the backgroundchange for the Christmas one?
[2015/11/24 14:34:37] <mt> Does the christmas hat also appear correctly if you're in development 'mode'?
[2015/11/24 14:34:56] <maths22> mt: Yes.  I tested it by changing my computer's date
[2015/11/24 14:35:11] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It is handled through an if clause in the menu.stl file
[2015/11/24 14:35:26] <Karkus> developer mode or debug build?

[2015/11/24 14:35:33] <mt> protip: rather make the code return true even if it's not christmas
[2015/11/24 14:35:51] <maths22> mt: I also did that
[2015/11/24 14:35:55] <mt> maybe we should even add an #ifdef for that for development purposes

[2015/11/24 14:36:25] <maths22> Why would developmer mode affect it at all
[2015/11/24 14:36:41] <maths22> mt: I get what you are saying.  I can add a CMake define for that

[2015/11/24 16:52:47] <maths22> I just created these issues so I don't forget in the future that I have this to work on
[2015/11/24 16:53:01] <Tobbi> :) Fine with me.
[2015/11/24 16:53:10] <Tobbi> And post-0.4.0 is a loooong way from today...
[2015/11/24 16:53:47] <maths22> Tobbi: I know, but 0.4.0 is a month from today (at least in theory)
[2015/11/24 16:53:52] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/24 16:54:04] <Tobbi> maths22: We'll make it. 20th of December...
[2015/11/24 16:54:26] <maths22> Tobbi: Also, once 0.4.0 releases, we should rename post-0.4.0 to future
[2015/11/24 16:54:33] <maths22> And we should create 0.4.1
[2015/11/24 16:55:10] <maths22> (future would be for things that don't yet have a specific target, like post-0.4.0 is now)
[2015/11/24 16:56:14] <Tobbi> yes.

[2015/11/24 16:58:48] <Tobbi> I only read it once, though.

[2015/11/24 16:59:04] <maths22> I really should read it again.  It was a lot of fun
[2015/11/24 16:59:13] <Tobbi> Yeah, same here.

[2015/11/24 17:00:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's a shame when you publicly critize a Christian for being hypocritical and he doesn't even reply...

[2015/11/25 10:45:35] <grumbel> Has anybody ever used the support for multiple tilesets inside a level (i.e. the (tilesets ...) tag in .stl files)?
[2015/11/25 10:46:42] <grumbel> I feel tempted to remove it, as it turns the code into a bit of a mess
[2015/11/25 10:47:06] <grumbel> Could also be cleaner implemented inside the tileset instead of inside the level files
[2015/11/25 10:47:25] <brmbrmcar> It seems useful although I have nevr used it.
[2015/11/25 10:49:20] <grumbel> The only level that uses them is ./data/levels/test_old/tilesets.stl and that one doesn't even work
[2015/11/25 10:49:51] <brmbrmcar> I would use it, but I nothing about tilesets myself.
[2015/11/25 10:50:00] <brmbrmcar> Is it a major change?
[2015/11/25 10:50:12] <grumbel> no, just removal of dead code
[2015/11/25 10:50:36] <brmbrmcar> OK, then. Fine.
[2015/11/25 10:50:53] <brmbrmcar> Probably won't be needed now.
[2015/11/25 10:58:40] <grumbel> All the addons that use custom tilesets just define a new one right now instead of mixing them inside the .stl
[2015/11/25 10:59:19] <grumbel> and the editor doesn't support it either of course

[2015/11/25 12:47:49] <Hume2> Hello Tobbi. Could you describe me what you think I've done recently?
[2015/11/25 12:48:05] <Tobbi> Hume2: I don't know. I believe it was a mistake on my part.
[2015/11/25 12:48:29] <Hume2> Tobbi: see https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commit/1f616741767b08e5c2db876f9484b327fcfd4cd9#diff-900335f1aa051f8b032208aa4a763c18L432
[2015/11/25 12:48:55] <Hume2> Tobbi: This is the code I've replaced with some more effective stuff.
[2015/11/25 12:48:57] <Tobbi> Hume2: Some tiles might need to have the COIN setting or something.
[2015/11/25 12:49:18] <Tobbi> I|m talking about // Marked for removal. Don't use
[2015/11/25 12:50:27] <Hume2> Tobbi: The COIN attribute is done another way.
[2015/11/25 12:50:34] <Tobbi> Sure?
[2015/11/25 12:50:37] <Tobbi> What about the others?
[2015/11/25 12:50:44] <Hume2> The same.

[2015/11/25 12:54:15] <Hume2> Tobbi: Previously, the images of the tiles were taken from the default blocks' presets.
[2015/11/25 12:54:32] <Tobbi> I see?
[2015/11/25 12:55:07] <Hume2> Tobbi: In the case ob Brick, there was just a list of IDs which sprite is for which tiles.
[2015/11/25 12:55:14] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/25 12:55:41] <Hume2> Tobbi: All blocks with coin #t had the default con sprite.
[2015/11/25 12:55:55] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yes. but I am willing to change that.
[2015/11/25 12:56:02] <Tobbi> Aka, have the blue coin sprite for other levels...
[2015/11/25 12:56:12] <Tobbi> For the Yeti's Revenge levels.
[2015/11/25 12:56:23] <Hume2> Tobbi: Was this even possible?
[2015/11/25 12:56:31] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yes it worked the one time I tried.
[2015/11/25 12:56:41] <Hume2> I'll take a look on it's tileset.
[2015/11/25 12:57:09] <Hume2> I think it must be a powerup, but I'll take a look anyway.
[2015/11/25 12:58:19] <Hume2> Tobbi: Yet's Revenge doesn't use any custom tileset.
[2015/11/25 12:58:45] <Tobbi> Hume2: As long as I can still set (coin #t) on some object, I am fine.
[2015/11/25 12:59:24] <Hume2> Tobbi: What are you speaking about? (coin #t) on tiles?
[2015/11/25 12:59:31] <Hume2> ...or on objects?
[2015/11/25 12:59:34] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yeah, not sure...
[2015/11/25 12:59:39] <Tobbi> Not sure how I managed it last time.
[2015/11/25 13:01:33] <Hume2> Tobbi: I don't know any object with a "coin" boolean.
[2015/11/25 13:01:58] <Hume2> Tobbi: And when you apply it on a tile, it becomes the normal yellow coin.
[2015/11/25 13:02:22] <Hume2> That's the previous behaviour.

[2015/11/25 13:19:06] <Tobbi> Hume2: The coins are custom objects.

[2015/11/25 14:15:48] <head8debian> "I am concerned about poultry and animals being given growth hormones". Arg... We don't give them growth hormones! We would be put out of buisiness if we did, but people don't realize that.
[2015/11/25 14:22:21] <head8debian> Also, the only reason we would(if ever) give them antibiotics is if they are not feeling well. Its illegal for us to sell animals with these antibiotics in their systems for up to 60 days after the last dose was given.
[2015/11/25 14:22:44] <head8debian> If any antibiotics are found in the meat the meat gets dumped and we get put out of buisiness, pretty much.

[2015/11/25 17:21:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: For a electrical fixture to be legally put up over here they have to meet some pretty strict quality standards.
[2015/11/25 17:22:00] <Tobbi> really?

[2015/11/26 08:36:34] <head8deb1an> mt: Its so over-used that you don't know whats safe or not.
[2015/11/26 08:38:18] <mt> if you'd continue the lines of the C and E both should finish up in a circle, some companies with unauthorized CE marks make the mistake to forget that ;)

[2015/11/26 09:19:18] <grumbel> Tobbi: It's all build ontop of the other sexp and memorycleanup branch, might be possible to transfer it, but not really worth it
[2015/11/26 09:19:24] <Tobbi> Ah!
[2015/11/26 09:19:31] <grumbel> That feature isn't documented or used by anything anyway.
[2015/11/26 09:19:32] <Tobbi> No, then we'll hold off on it until after 0.4.0

[2015/11/26 09:22:18] <grumbel> no, it just cleanups the Tileset memory management a bit

[2015/11/26 12:27:50] <Tobbi> mt: Come on, why are you nitpicking?
[2015/11/26 12:28:02] <Tobbi> You're almost as bad as that other nitpicker I kind of remember.
[2015/11/26 12:28:10] <Tobbi> very very vaguely...
[2015/11/26 12:29:15] <mt> ok, I'll stop *hides*
[2015/11/26 12:29:37] * brmbrmcar is getting confused...
[2015/11/26 12:31:58] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You have always been confused... There's no "getting confused" for you.
[2015/11/26 12:32:27] <brmbrmcar> I will fix the finishworldmap() command...
[2015/11/26 12:33:21] <brmbrmcar> Ah, it isn't called that.
[2015/11/26 12:34:10] <brmbrmcar> But the real one doesn't work!
[2015/11/26 12:35:55] <Tobbi> head8arch: I just tweeted a call-out to potential translators.
[2015/11/26 12:36:10] <Tobbi> Not sure if many read it, though.
[2015/11/26 12:39:07] <Tobbi> By the way: Do we follow people back that follow us? Might seem nice.
[2015/11/26 12:42:20] <mt> you might also want to follow the fsf/gnu accounts, github, transifex (if they have twitter)
[2015/11/26 12:43:05] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/11/26 12:48:13] <mt> So how can I review translations in transifex
[2015/11/26 12:49:30] <leper`> you need to be reviewer or coordinator or project owner (or something like that)
[2015/11/26 12:49:40] <leper`> then you have a review button in the webinterface
[2015/11/26 12:49:54] <mt> also, regarding the requestion languages: what's your opinion on adding en_AU and de_AT? seems pretty useless
[2015/11/26 12:50:03] <Tobbi> mt: I don't know if I've been given you the necessary rights, yet. But if you ask one of the admins nicely, then I am sure something can be arranged :P

[2015/11/26 12:51:31] <leper`> (to add to the country specific thing: We (0ad in case nobody saw the above link) don't add those for the most part (unless the languages actually differ enough), and we also do not add lang_FOO but lang normally)
[2015/11/26 12:51:48] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/26 12:53:39] <leper`> (which helps since we have some code for falling back to eg en in case en_AU is the system/user locale and en_AU does not exist)
[2015/11/26 12:55:26] <brmbrmcar> Different country variants?
[2015/11/26 12:55:45] <brmbrmcar> That is way too confusing. What is defaul?

[2015/11/26 13:01:57] <brmbrmcar> I don't know.
[2015/11/26 13:02:01] <Tobbi> People shouldn't be dicks about their language anyway. I even tolerate reading Bavarian, unless it's bad Bavarian.

[2015/11/26 13:31:03] <grumbel> It's if (state == ...) { } if () if () ... not if/else if/else if/else
[2015/11/26 13:31:13] <grumbel> and state changes inside the if-blocks
[2015/11/26 13:31:57] <grumbel> state == CHARGING does a state = ATTACKING
[2015/11/26 13:32:07] <grumbel> with a switch() you skip over that
[2015/11/26 13:32:23] <Hume2> Oh, I'll correct that.

[2015/11/26 13:42:56] <grumbel> It does something different then before and is now a frame late

[2015/11/26 14:51:25] <Tobbi> Let's see if I can break it.
[2015/11/26 14:51:56] <brmbrmcar> I queried red_bot once and tried to figlet the full chemical name of titin.
[2015/11/26 14:52:08] @ leyyin joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/26 14:52:09] <brmbrmcar> It just threw up an error.
[2015/11/26 14:52:12] <Karkus> I did the same except with lorum ipsum
[2015/11/26 14:52:21] <Tobbi> *lorem
[2015/11/26 14:52:33] <leper`> et si dolor
[2015/11/26 14:52:38] <brmbrmcar> I don't get lorem ipsum.
[2015/11/26 14:52:38] <Karkus> Meant that :D
[2015/11/26 14:52:45] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: And you never will.
[2015/11/26 14:52:47] <Karkus> https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=lorum+ipsum
[2015/11/26 14:52:53] <Tobbi> It's latin. Naturally you don't get it.
[2015/11/26 14:53:06] <Karkus> It's not proper Latin though
[2015/11/26 14:53:07] <brmbrmcar> I don't see the point.
[2015/11/26 14:53:22] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Visual deficiency as well, now?
[2015/11/26 14:53:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: I thought it was...
[2015/11/26 14:53:31] <brmbrmcar> You could just type in anything you want.
[2015/11/26 14:53:43] <Hume2> I don't understand latin.
[2015/11/26 14:53:56] <Tobbi> Oh, no, it is not...
[2015/11/26 14:54:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: "The lorem ipsum text is typically a scrambled section of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC Latin text by Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin."
[2015/11/26 14:54:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yup, the German wikipedia told me kind of the same, anyway.
[2015/11/26 14:54:43] @ Drangue joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/26 14:54:44] <brmbrmcar> I have never used lorem isum.
[2015/11/26 14:54:55] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: No wonder, it's called lorem ipsum.
[2015/11/26 14:55:04] @ Quit: alket: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2015/11/26 14:55:43] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: That was a typo!
[2015/11/26 14:55:54] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: No, that was a reply to your typo.
[2015/11/26 14:56:02] <Tobbi> And that was some person quitting due to ping timeout.
[2015/11/26 14:56:02] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/26 14:56:22] <brmbrmcar> Any way of hanging Tux's sprite in a level?
[2015/11/26 14:56:32] <Tobbi> I should write my ph.D. on how to properly annoy immature-acting individuals.
[2015/11/26 14:56:37] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: It's filler text. Its purpose is to mean nothing while still displaying the features of the thing...
[2015/11/26 14:56:44] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Decals
[2015/11/26 14:57:01] <brmbrmcar> So why not write in This is a filler text!
[2015/11/26 14:57:22] <Karkus> Because that would be far too easy for simple people to understand/
[2015/11/26 14:57:24] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Because people who have OCD get so drawn to reading this, than a non-sensical text.
[2015/11/26 14:57:25] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/26 14:57:26] <leper`> Tobbi: just so you can write phallus Dickus next to your name when signing things
[2015/11/26 14:57:36] <Tobbi> leper`: *Biggus dickus.
[2015/11/26 14:57:49] <leper`> but that doesn't fit the abbreviation
[2015/11/26 14:57:53] <Tobbi> Oh, right.
[2015/11/26 14:58:25] <leper`> (and yes there's a pun hidden there)
[2015/11/26 14:58:59] <Tobbi> whatever...
[2015/11/26 14:59:30] <leper`> well you wanted to write about being a dick on the internet
[2015/11/26 15:00:16] <Tobbi> ah
[2015/11/26 15:00:17] <Tobbi> hah.
[2015/11/26 15:02:19] @ Quit: brmbrmcar: Quit: brmbrmquit
[2015/11/26 15:03:04] <Hume2> It's cool.
[2015/11/26 15:03:16] <Tobbi> finally!
[2015/11/26 15:03:21] <Tobbi> If he reads this, he will rejoin.
[2015/11/26 15:03:28] @ octo_ is now known as octo
[2015/11/26 15:03:30] <Tobbi> Why can't he change his quit message to something sane?
[2015/11/26 15:03:48] <leper`> /quite something sane
[2015/11/26 15:03:54] <leper`> /quit something sane
[2015/11/26 15:03:56] <leper`> dang
[2015/11/26 15:03:59] @ Quit: Karkus: Quit: Leaving
[2015/11/26 15:04:07] <Tobbi> Yeah, for example that ^
[2015/11/26 15:04:10] <Tobbi> Leaving!
[2015/11/26 15:04:13] <Tobbi> That sounds sane.
[2015/11/26 15:04:35] <leper`> "Living" would be another one
[2015/11/26 15:04:57] <Tobbi> And it would even be true...

[2015/11/26 15:18:46] <Tobbi> Just translating...
[2015/11/26 15:18:56] <Karkus> Did I miss something?
[2015/11/26 15:19:11] <Tobbi> Karkus: In the literal sense? Nothing much.
[2015/11/26 15:19:40] <Karkus> So what are you translating from?
[2015/11/26 15:19:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: A video...
[2015/11/26 15:20:30] <Karkus> Oh, okay :D Google translate captions are great, too
[2015/11/26 15:21:00] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2015/11/26 15:21:03] <Tobbi> let me see...

[2015/11/26 15:21:07] <brmbrmcar> You calling me insane?
[2015/11/26 15:21:50] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: No, I am calling your quit message insane...
[2015/11/26 15:21:53] <Tobbi> That's a difference.
[2015/11/26 15:21:54] <brmbrmcar> How do you even set a quit message? I have to do it manually!
[2015/11/26 15:22:39] <Karkus> If you think really hard about it for long enough, it will change. Other than that, yes, you must do it manually
[2015/11/26 15:22:58] <brmbrmcar>  /set quitMessage quit?
[2015/11/26 15:23:07] <brmbrmcar> Absolutely crazy.
[2015/11/26 15:24:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: tele-quit-nesis?
[2015/11/26 15:24:43] <Karkus> Yep
[2015/11/26 15:24:56] <brmbrmcar> I set it!
[2015/11/26 15:25:11] <Karkus> Well done
[2015/11/26 15:25:19] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Okay, now. Try it out.
[2015/11/26 15:25:22] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/11/26 15:26:24] <Karkus> Wow
[2015/11/26 15:26:35] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/11/26 15:26:35] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/26 15:26:38] <brmbrmcar> Did it work?
[2015/11/26 15:26:41] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You didn't quit hard enough.
[2015/11/26 15:26:51] <Karkus> It worked great!
[2015/11/26 15:26:53] <brmbrmcar> Well, I set it.
[2015/11/26 15:26:53] <Tobbi> Break your router, maybe it'll work the.
[2015/11/26 15:26:55] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/11/26 15:26:57] <Hume2> The quit message was "brmbrmquit".
[2015/11/26 15:27:01] <Karkus> What did you change it to again?
[2015/11/26 15:27:05] <brmbrmcar> Inyellow?
[2015/11/26 15:27:32] <Hume2> I saw "brmbrmquit".
[2015/11/26 15:27:37] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/26 15:28:03] <Karkus> sudo rm -rf / #<quit message>
[2015/11/26 15:28:10] <brmbrmcar> No!
[2015/11/26 15:28:30] <brmbrmcar> I removed the password requirement!
[2015/11/26 15:28:38] <Karkus> Wow
[2015/11/26 15:28:51] <brmbrmcar> sudo visudo
[2015/11/26 15:28:57] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Why would you do that?
[2015/11/26 15:28:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: I can tell that this worked.
[2015/11/26 15:29:09] <Tobbi> I mean: brmbrmcar: I can tell that Karkus' advice worked.
[2015/11/26 15:29:17] <brmbrmcar> Because I'm very lazy.
[2015/11/26 15:29:39] <brmbrmcar> sudo rm -rf won't actually delete everything.
[2015/11/26 15:29:56] <Tobbi> Oh, maybe format...something.
[2015/11/26 15:30:01] <brmbrmcar> Only if you get to root.
[2015/11/26 15:30:34] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: What if you do sudo rm -rf / by accident?
[2015/11/26 15:30:34] <Karkus> like, when changing your quit message
[2015/11/26 15:31:04] <brmbrmcar> Lets see if running commands actually works from irssi?
[2015/11/26 15:31:20] <brmbrmcar> sudo arduino
[2015/11/26 15:31:24] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: But, will it remove your IRC client?
[2015/11/26 15:31:33] <brmbrmcar> I'll take that as a no.
[2015/11/26 15:31:38] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: No.
[2015/11/26 15:31:43] <brmbrmcar> sudo rm -rf
[2015/11/26 15:31:49] <brmbrmcar> See.
[2015/11/26 15:32:00] <Hume2> Um...
[2015/11/26 15:32:11] <Hume2> Does it do anything?
[2015/11/26 15:32:17] <brmbrmcar> Nope.
[2015/11/26 15:32:24] <Hume2> That's good.
[2015/11/26 15:32:49] <brmbrmcar> Otherwise it would be like Unknown command! Unknown command!
[2015/11/26 15:32:56] <Karkus> [sudo] password for brmbrmcar:
[2015/11/26 15:33:13] <brmbrmcar> Not telling  you the password...
[2015/11/26 15:33:20] <Tobbi> I suppose it's brmbrmcar.
[2015/11/26 15:33:24] <Tobbi> or brmbrmpassword
[2015/11/26 15:33:28] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/26 15:33:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: Haha
[2015/11/26 15:33:32] <brmbrmcar> Because you are on s different computer
[2015/11/26 15:33:42] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: What about ssh?
[2015/11/26 15:33:58] <brmbrmcar> Nah. Not through irssi.
[2015/11/26 15:34:04] <Karkus> I am secretly a super anonymous hacker
[2015/11/26 15:34:31] <Hume2> Karkus: Can we analyze angrystone.cpp?
[2015/11/26 15:34:46] <brmbrmcar> Invert my GitHub profile picture then, hacker.
[2015/11/26 15:34:48] <Karkus> Hume2: Analyse? Why?
[2015/11/26 15:35:24] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Challenge accepted.
[2015/11/26 15:35:25] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/26 15:35:42] <brmbrmcar> OK, then.
[2015/11/26 15:35:43] <Hume2> Karkus: There's some kind of "bug" about that I want to know more.
[2015/11/26 15:35:49] <brmbrmcar> 5 minutes left.
[2015/11/26 15:35:51] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Solution: turn your computer upside down
[2015/11/26 15:36:07] <Hume2> Karkus: Angrystone::active_update
[2015/11/26 15:36:20] <brmbrmcar> I ean horizontally!
[2015/11/26 15:36:29] <brmbrmcar> Or whichever way that is!
[2015/11/26 15:36:57] <Hume2> Karkus: I changed there something and I want to know whether it's better or worse.
[2015/11/26 15:37:18] <Karkus> So, you want me to test it?
[2015/11/26 15:37:33] <Hume2> Karkus: No, see the code please.
[2015/11/26 15:37:36] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: http://imgur.com/h6PPmOi
[2015/11/26 15:37:51] <Karkus> Hume2: Right. Which commit?
[2015/11/26 15:38:14] <Hume2> Karkus: The last two commits.
[2015/11/26 15:38:23] <Karkus> Okay
[2015/11/26 15:38:39] <Hume2> Karkus: As you can see, I changed the bunch of if's to a switch.
[2015/11/26 15:38:59] <Karkus> You did.
[2015/11/26 15:39:14] <Hume2> Karkus: There's a problem that the state can be changed inside the switch.
[2015/11/26 15:39:46] <Hume2> Karkus: As it was before, it went to the other state's if exception, but now it skips it.
[2015/11/26 15:40:19] <Karkus> Of course, that's how switches work...
[2015/11/26 15:40:29] <Hume2> Karkus: However, there's something that causes that it behaves exacly the same.
[2015/11/26 15:40:51] <Karkus> I don't understand?
[2015/11/26 15:41:03] <Karkus> You mean, it shouldn't work but it does?
[2015/11/26 15:41:22] <Hume2> Karkus: No, I mean that it worked before the same as it does now.
[2015/11/26 15:41:49] <Hume2> Karkus: As you can see, there's a nested exception in each case.
[2015/11/26 15:42:43] <Hume2> Karkus: Do you see it?
[2015/11/26 15:44:11] <brmbrmcar> tobbi: Awesome!
[2015/11/26 15:44:19] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: And now stop.

[2015/11/26 15:59:33] <Karkus> The problem is that you don't want a change inside the case to cause the next case to be run?
[2015/11/26 15:59:33] <Karkus> Hume2: Is there a test level where I can understand the problem?

[2015/11/27 10:39:23] <Tobbi> giby: Are you there?
[2015/11/27 10:40:30] <head8debian> Hello Tobbi.
[2015/11/27 10:40:46] <Tobbi> hello head8debian
[2015/11/27 10:42:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: So, here is a question. I want to start doing screencasts for computer-related things, but what should i do?
[2015/11/27 10:42:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh?
[2015/11/27 10:42:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: Make a beautiful supertux 0.4.0 video...
[2015/11/27 10:42:44] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/27 10:42:48] <giby> Hi Tobbi
[2015/11/27 10:42:56] <brmbrmcar> Install screencasting software.
[2015/11/27 10:43:10] <Tobbi> giby: So, when you download po files, how are they arranged? Assuming I want to create a script that packages these into add-ons.
[2015/11/27 10:43:10] <brmbrmcar> I assume you can get it to work...
[2015/11/27 10:43:23] <Tobbi> giby: I am talking about the tx client.
[2015/11/27 10:43:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: The issue with that is that my GPU cannot keep up when running a screen recorder and SUpertux.
[2015/11/27 10:43:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: Well, then, you're doomed.
[2015/11/27 10:43:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: Doomed? ;D
[2015/11/27 10:44:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: yes.
[2015/11/27 10:44:02] <brmbrmcar> Find a way around it.
[2015/11/27 10:44:20] <giby> Tobbi, ... well first I unzip the add ons, put the po files in each folders, then repack, get md5sum and push
[2015/11/27 10:44:31] <brmbrmcar> Like one of those programs they use to spy on you.
[2015/11/27 10:44:59] <Tobbi> giby: So, you do this manually... When you download them, what do you download? I want to create a script that automates creating langpacks...
[2015/11/27 10:45:21] <Tobbi> I assume you keep getting po files that I also get when I download manually...
[2015/11/27 10:45:34] <Tobbi> Are the po files all in one folder?
[2015/11/27 10:45:50] <Tobbi> I just need information on the folder structure of the stuff you download.
[2015/11/27 10:46:25] <giby> I use the client
[2015/11/27 10:47:12] <Tobbi> giby: Okay, what do you get then? one po file per language per add-on?
[2015/11/27 10:47:18] <Tobbi> in one folder?
[2015/11/27 10:49:21] <Tobbi> Actually, I could just make it query the downloaded files...
[2015/11/27 10:49:26] <Tobbi> From the current directory...
[2015/11/27 10:51:26] <Tobbi> giby: Basically, you use tx pull -a right?
[2015/11/27 11:05:28] <brmbrmcar> What is the full play_sound script?
[2015/11/27 11:08:55] <brmbrmcar> Got it working.

[2015/11/27 11:16:18] <Tobbi> giby: I'll try to write a script that creates ZIP files out of the po files...to use as language add-ons.
[2015/11/27 11:16:20] <giby> Tobbi, all po for one add-on are in the add-on folder

[2015/11/28 08:26:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: Cool.
[2015/11/28 08:26:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: How far are you guessing that you are on it?
[2015/11/28 08:27:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: It can create zip files and create an nfo file to be appended to the repo index.
[2015/11/28 08:27:31] <Tobbi> So, that's done.
[2015/11/28 08:27:37] <Tobbi> Not sure what else is needed, though.
[2015/11/28 08:27:55] <Tobbi> It also might only work on OSX...
[2015/11/28 08:28:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: o_O
[2015/11/28 08:29:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: When you do md5 <file path>, does it give you the file path in that case?
[2015/11/28 08:29:57] <Tobbi> Sorry, I meant md5 -q <file path>
[2015/11/28 08:30:39] <head8debian> Hmm, let me try it on a random file.
[2015/11/28 08:30:49] <Tobbi> head8debian: I meant the md5 of that thing.
[2015/11/28 08:30:59] <Tobbi> md5 -q <file path> should give you the md5 of course.
[2015/11/28 08:32:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: There is no md5, only md5sum.
[2015/11/28 08:32:59] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/11/28 08:33:03] <head8debian> And there is no -q perameter for it.
[2015/11/28 08:33:04] <mt> can we switch to something more future-proof than md5, like BLAKE2, or at least SHA-2
[2015/11/28 08:33:22] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, there's the problem with mac vs. linux.
[2015/11/28 08:33:29] <head8debian> There is --quiet, not -q...
[2015/11/28 08:35:06] <mt> it's a bsd vs gnu difference, not something apple or linux specific
[2015/11/28 08:36:02] <Tobbi> I see.
[2015/11/28 08:36:14] <Tobbi> mt: So, how do I get an md5 that likely works on all platforms?
[2015/11/28 08:37:47] <mt> you write one in python, perl or ruby
[2015/11/28 08:37:58] <Tobbi> Hmm, that might work...
[2015/11/28 08:39:17] <mt> or, if openssl/libressl works, `openssl dgst -md5 -hex /path/to/file`
[2015/11/28 08:40:21] <mt> md5 in that command can be replaced with sha256, sha384, sha512, whirlpool and some others I don't want to mention because they're also outdated
[2015/11/28 08:40:50] <Tobbi> Yes, unfortunately we currently depend on MD5...and we should keep it that way until after 0.4.0...
[2015/11/28 08:40:55] <Tobbi> Otherwise people will complain.
[2015/11/28 08:42:47] <mt> one might argue: "but it's just downloading an addon file", well the actual problem: the zips could be modified to work like a zip-bomb (and that's the reason why one doesn't simply extract any archive without verification)
[2015/11/28 08:44:16] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/28 08:49:52] <Tobbi> So, I just added language packs that I created.
[2015/11/28 08:52:36] <Tobbi> Yay! Okay, I wrecked it :D

[2015/11/28 08:59:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: o_O
[2015/11/28 08:59:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: I will push a fix in the meantime.
[2015/11/28 09:00:20] <Tobbi> This will wreck downloading add-ons for everyone who doesn't have the latest version.
[2015/11/28 09:00:21] <Tobbi> But who cares

[2015/11/28 09:03:00] <Tobbi> Currently you have to go through all these languages in the add-on manager and get your language pack.
[2015/11/28 09:05:44] <Tobbi> Actually, before I wreck it for everyone, I might want to exclude the _ add-ons from the repo index.
[2015/11/28 09:09:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: If I only showed the language pack for the selected language, would that work?

[2015/11/28 14:34:28] <Tobbi> Then tell me the timelog...
[2015/11/28 14:34:59] <head8debian> In a min.\
[2015/11/28 14:36:22] <Tobbi> head8debian: Also, start with --debug
[2015/11/28 14:36:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: Odd, when i run --debug the music starts quite a bit before the game appears.
[2015/11/28 14:36:32] <Tobbi> Oh, I already told you that :D
[2015/11/28 14:36:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: Latest master?
[2015/11/28 14:36:48] <Tobbi> *sigh* not odd at all...
[2015/11/28 14:37:11] <head8debian> Yes, latest master.
[2015/11/28 14:37:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, instaleld german. Now what?
[2015/11/28 14:37:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am downloading language packs...or checking for language packs...
[2015/11/28 14:37:30] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/11/28 14:37:32] <Tobbi> Seems like this might not be the best way to do it, then.
[2015/11/28 14:37:34] <head8debian> You have quite a list.
[2015/11/28 14:37:47] <Tobbi> Your internet connection is small, I assume.
[2015/11/28 14:37:51] <Tobbi> eeh slow
[2015/11/28 14:37:54] <head8debian> Yes. ;D

[2015/11/28 14:40:29] <Tobbi> head8debian: No...I don't know what we could do.
[2015/11/28 14:40:38] <Tobbi> Unless we start the process after the game has started...
[2015/11/28 14:40:43] <Tobbi> We could look into that.
[2015/11/28 14:41:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: WHAT Proccess?
[2015/11/28 14:41:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: The download process...
[2015/11/28 14:41:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot follow when you talk half to yourself. :)
[2015/11/28 14:41:57] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/11/28 14:42:05] <head8debian> When is it starting now?
[2015/11/28 14:42:10] <head8debian> Oh, i see...
[2015/11/28 14:42:22] <head8debian> Hmm.
[2015/11/28 14:42:36] <head8debian> I'd prefer the download to be triggered manually, personally.
[2015/11/28 14:42:55] <head8debian> Otherwise supertux has because windows. Downloading things without your knowledge.
[2015/11/28 14:43:19] <head8debian> ;)
[2015/11/28 14:43:32] <mt> after the game has started/in parallel to loading would require working reload capability
[2015/11/28 14:44:28] <mt> head8debian: we could do it like supertuxkart, ask for permission to access network functions on the first start
[2015/11/28 14:44:58] <head8debian> Exactly...
[2015/11/28 14:45:30] <mt> but I guess that won't happen in 0.4.x because string freeze
[2015/11/28 14:45:35] <head8debian> The few people on dialup will think that supertux doesn't work because of slow startup.
[2015/11/28 14:46:35] <Tobbi> mt: Yeah, I will possibly revert my attempt to load it at startup. If you have a better idea, go right ahead.

[2015/11/29 11:08:42] <Tobbi> leyyin: xgettext = extraction from source files...
[2015/11/29 11:08:50] <leyyin> yes :D
[2015/11/29 11:08:52] <leyyin> I know that
[2015/11/29 11:08:52] <Tobbi> aka, string extraction...
[2015/11/29 11:08:58] <leyyin> I only worked with that
[2015/11/29 11:09:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: I have \n in scripts...it removes that during parsing.
[2015/11/29 11:09:11] <Tobbi> Any way to prevent that?
[2015/11/29 11:09:24] <leyyin> is xtinygettext different?
[2015/11/29 11:09:40] <Tobbi> leyyin: I meant xgettext
[2015/11/29 11:09:43] <Tobbi> I am confused.
[2015/11/29 11:09:46] <Tobbi> But you know that
[2015/11/29 11:09:57] <Tobbi> And sometimes I am a fanatic lychee.
[2015/11/29 11:10:03] <Tobbi> Oh god, I sound like brmbrmcar
[2015/11/29 11:10:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, i code the script and you replace a head gasket? :D Only be $300 + 20 hours of time.
[2015/11/29 11:10:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: If you pay for that, sure... I mean: Pay for limo, plus flight plus limo to your home, plus my time...
[2015/11/29 11:10:46] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/29 11:10:56] <Tobbi> plus, restaurant, hotel etc.
[2015/11/29 11:11:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: You eat cow feed! :D
[2015/11/29 11:11:07] <leyyin> Tobbi, xgettext should not modify source files...
[2015/11/29 11:11:12] <leyyin> as far as I know
[2015/11/29 11:11:15] <head8debian> And sleep in the barn. :D
[2015/11/29 11:11:27] <Tobbi> leyyin: It doesn't modify the source files, but it omits the backslash while parsing,
[2015/11/29 11:11:31] <Tobbi> I checked.
[2015/11/29 11:12:28] <leyyin> weird
[2015/11/29 11:13:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: Indeed. I know that normally line breaks are written some other way in gettext files, but the source string is like this "This is some text\ninmultiplelines" so it needs to be that exact way...
[2015/11/29 11:13:40] <Tobbi> I could fix the strings with some other python script, but I'd rather avoid doing this magic.
[2015/11/29 11:14:36] <leyyin> Tobbi, Each of untranslated-string and translated-string respects the C syntax for a character string, including the surrounding quotes and embedded backslashed escape sequences. When the time comes to write multi-line strings, one should not use escaped newlines. Instead, a closing quote should follow the last character on the line to be continued, and an opening quote should resume the string at the beginning of the following PO file line.
[2015/11/29 11:14:38] <leyyin> rtfm
[2015/11/29 11:15:07] <Tobbi> leyyin: I could do that, but it wouldn't find the source string then...
[2015/11/29 11:15:15] <Tobbi> The source string is like that with the escaped \n.
[2015/11/29 11:15:18] <Tobbi> ffs.
[2015/11/29 11:15:34] <leyyin> did you read above?
[2015/11/29 11:15:35] <leyyin> "Instead, a closing quote should follow the last character on the line to be continued, and an opening quote should resume the string at the beginning of the following PO file line."
[2015/11/29 11:15:44] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, it'll find that?
[2015/11/29 11:15:48] <Tobbi> I'll try...one moment.
[2015/11/29 11:15:51] <leyyin> yes...

[2015/11/29 11:16:41] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/29 11:17:22] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/29 11:17:28] <leyyin> bash sucks anyways
[2015/11/29 11:17:36] <leyyin> bash syntax even more
[2015/11/29 11:17:49] <Tobbi> leyyin: I know...but makepot.sh was written in bash.
[2015/11/29 11:18:03] <leyyin> it's fine, if the script is under 100 lines :P
[2015/11/29 11:18:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: the important stuff is done in python anyway...
[2015/11/29 11:18:31] <Tobbi> As in: Fetching the source strings to translate and getting them in a format that xgettext can understand.
[2015/11/29 11:20:04] <leyyin> and for your shell you should use zsh or better, fish :P
[2015/11/29 11:20:30] <Tobbi> leyyin: I don't care about the bash script anyway...I should probably reprogram ./makepot.sh to use python instead.
[2015/11/29 11:25:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: Okay, it worked. I will try to split the string then...
[2015/11/29 11:30:56] <leyyin> see, if you read the manual you win ;)
[2015/11/29 11:38:01] <Tobbi> leyyin: By asking you, one might win as well :D
[2015/11/29 11:38:08] <Tobbi> Since you are basically google, you know everything :D
[2015/11/29 11:38:18] <leyyin> right....

[2015/11/29 11:47:13] <Hume2> Transifex is very working :D
[2015/11/29 11:50:30] <Tobbi> Hume2: It's working?
[2015/11/29 12:00:22] <Tobbi> Atom is actually quite a nice text editor.

[2015/11/29 16:33:35] <Tobbi> giby: I updated translations on transifex despite string freeze...It's the tux and penny intro level strings...
[2015/11/29 16:33:43] <Tobbi> I figured we might want to add those...
[2015/11/29 16:33:46] <Tobbi> Before the release, I mean.
[2015/11/29 16:34:08] <giby> Ok
[2015/11/29 16:34:40] <Tobbi> giby: Could you please check whether the latest makepot.sh works for you?
[2015/11/29 16:34:49] <Tobbi> If not, I might need to do some changes.
[2015/11/29 16:35:03] <giby> I'll check
[2015/11/29 16:35:11] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/29 16:35:20] <Tobbi> And do reset the generated files afterwards
[2015/11/29 16:35:33] <Tobbi> They are generated inside the translations/ subdirectory now.
[2015/11/29 16:35:41] <Tobbi> But I already told you about the submodule :D

[2015/11/30 11:39:20] <Tobbi> Hello, Karkus.
[2015/11/30 11:39:33] <Karkus> Hey Tobbi
[2015/11/30 11:39:38] <head8debian> Hello Karkus.
[2015/11/30 11:39:54] <Karkus> Hello head8debian
[2015/11/30 11:40:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: I managed to get the intro talk between penny and tux on transifex.
[2015/11/30 11:40:14] <Tobbi> Now it only needs to be translated.
[2015/11/30 11:40:55] <Tobbi> Also, release in just...3 (?) weeks?
[2015/11/30 11:41:02] <Tobbi> Less than, even.
[2015/11/30 11:41:13] <Tobbi> We set the 20th, didn't we?
[2015/11/30 11:41:48] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/30 11:41:53] <brmbrmcar> 20 days.
[2015/11/30 11:42:50] <Karkus> Well, it depends whether you want a test build now to ensure everything works... e.g. test windows and installer.
[2015/11/30 11:43:04] <Karkus> by 'now' I mean soon
[2015/11/30 11:43:06] <head8debian> It would probably be a good idea.
[2015/11/30 11:43:27] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/30 11:44:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: I did you a favour and removed langpack update checking at startup.
[2015/11/30 11:44:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/30 11:46:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, let's get a test build out in a week? Hoping that maths22 is ready...
[2015/11/30 11:47:05] <Tobbi> We should integrate l10n from transifex before, though.
[2015/11/30 11:47:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: Sounds like a plan
[2015/11/30 11:48:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: Also, check out this *beautiful* python script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SuperTux/supertux/master/extract_strings.py It's so beautiful that the beauty it radiates makes everything around it even more beautiful.
[2015/11/30 11:49:57] <brmbrmcar> I like it.
[2015/11/30 11:50:07] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/30 11:50:07] <brmbrmcar> Easy enough to understand.
[2015/11/30 11:50:12] <Tobbi> I am merely messing with you guys.

[2015/11/30 11:50:23] <Tobbi> Because it's just a python script.

[2015/11/30 11:51:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: Nothing special about it?
[2015/11/30 11:51:44] <Tobbi> Karkus: Just that I had to write it because xgettext wouldn't appreciate "\n" inside the source strings.
[2015/11/30 11:52:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: The scripts fetches translate tags from squirrel files and writes them to a lisp file.
[2015/11/30 11:52:19] <Tobbi> Which xgettext can fetch.
[2015/11/30 11:52:49] <Karkus> Okay :)
[2015/11/30 11:53:20] <brmbrmcar> xgettext?
[2015/11/30 11:53:52] <Tobbi> ...extracts translatable strings fro source files.

[2015/11/30 11:59:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: Is that level even in the worldmap?
[2015/11/30 11:59:24] <Hume2> Tobbi: No, it isn't.
[2015/11/30 12:02:18] <brmbrmcar> Nice level.
[2015/11/30 12:02:25] <Tobbi> nice eyes...
[2015/11/30 12:02:29] <Tobbi> nice ice
[2015/11/30 12:02:36] <Tobbi> We should add a couple levels to incubator...
[2015/11/30 12:03:08] <brmbrmcar> Like what?
[2015/11/30 12:03:34] <Tobbi> There are some levels that didn't make it into Bonus Island 3.
[2015/11/30 12:04:07] <Hume2> Any idea why they aren't there?
[2015/11/30 12:05:04] <Tobbi> Hume2: I talked to LMH and he removed some of them...
[2015/11/30 12:05:12] <Tobbi> Hume2: But the latest worldmap is here: http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=915
[2015/11/30 12:05:41] <Tobbi> Can you go through them, and see which ones aren't in Bonus Island 3 and add these to Incubator...?
[2015/11/30 12:06:28] <Hume2> Tobbi: will do
[2015/11/30 12:06:44] <Tobbi> Actually, LMH claims the add-ons repo contains an updated version, not sure if that's true.
[2015/11/30 12:08:25] <Hume2> Tobbi: It's true, the .zip is there, but the sorve in /src is missing.
[2015/11/30 12:08:28] <brmbrmcar> There was  variant of Bonus Island 3 in 0.3.4 and previous.
[2015/11/30 12:08:40] <Tobbi> Hume2: Link to the zip.

[2015/12/01 10:37:43] <brmbrmcar> Or 1600.
[2015/12/01 10:39:54] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You got nothing else to do than checking the logs right?
[2015/12/01 10:41:03] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/12/01 10:41:16] <brmbrmcar> I just looked at them

[2015/12/01 10:42:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: I woke up at that time.
[2015/12/01 10:43:09] <brmbrmcar> I like waking up as early as possible.

[2015/12/01 10:44:35] <brmbrmcar> I hate that version!
[2015/12/01 10:44:48] <brmbrmcar> In fact, I hate all Christmas music!

[2015/12/01 10:45:08] <head8debian> No christmas music... i hate listening to it.
[2015/12/01 10:45:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why?
[2015/12/01 10:45:39] <brmbrmcar> Christmas music is just a way to get a bkt of fast profit.
[2015/12/01 10:46:15] <brmbrmcar> All the other businesses selling stuff benefit, and music wants to join.
[2015/12/01 10:46:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't know, im just over annoyed by it this year.
[2015/12/01 10:46:43] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did you listen to Shakin Stevens - Merry Christmas Everyone already?
[2015/12/01 10:47:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: No.
[2015/12/01 10:47:12] <head8debian> And im tired.
[2015/12/01 10:47:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: See...
[2015/12/01 10:47:28] <head8debian> It says Christmas... so i don't want to. :)

[2015/12/01 10:48:35] <brmbrmcar> Accoding to me, it starts on the 25th.
[2015/12/01 10:49:35] <head8debian> Acording to the radio it start in the end of October...
[2015/12/01 10:49:39] * head8debian shoots the DJ. :p
[2015/12/01 10:50:05] <Tobbi> In Russia, DJ shoots you.
[2015/12/01 10:50:16] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/12/01 10:50:55] <brmbrmcar> I'm going to start my calendert a day late.
[2015/12/01 10:51:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: If you don't listen to it, I will post the lyrics here so you can imagine it.
[2015/12/01 10:51:19] <Tobbi> one line each.
[2015/12/01 10:52:12] <brmbrmcar> I have a song.
[2015/12/01 10:52:18] <brmbrmcar> For Christmas.
[2015/12/01 10:52:25] <brmbrmcar> Well, thew lyrics.
[2015/12/01 10:52:29] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I said "I" not, you.
[2015/12/01 10:52:41] <Tobbi> oh, those weren't lyrics.
[2015/12/01 10:53:15] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2015/12/01 10:54:55] <brmbrmcar> All these other songs over-axaggarate Christmas.
[2015/12/01 10:55:43] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: axe...
[2015/12/01 10:55:50] <Tobbi> fits to xmas perfectly...
[2015/12/01 10:55:52] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/01 10:56:03] <brmbrmcar> I meant exaggerate.
[2015/12/01 10:56:20] <brmbrmcar> And I don't like "xmas".
[2015/12/01 10:56:27] <brmbrmcar> It's "Christmas".
[2015/12/01 10:56:36] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: axe mess.
[2015/12/01 10:56:40] <Tobbi> *mass
[2015/12/01 10:56:46] <Tobbi> wait, no mess...
[2015/12/01 10:57:12] <Tobbi> Jesus was born and it was a big axe mess.
[2015/12/01 10:57:34] <brmbrmcar> Oh, that is why it's called Christmas.
[2015/12/01 10:57:41] <brmbrmcar> I forgot.
[2015/12/01 10:59:22] <Tobbi> He took my arm, I don't know how it happened... he cut the floor and he said: Oh, don't you dare look back, I'll keep your eyes for me, he said: don't hold it back, I said: Shut up and cut for me.
[2015/12/01 10:59:32] <Tobbi> And he was like: "This torso is my destiny"
[2015/12/01 11:00:25] <brmbrmcar> Why do calenders stop at 24?
[2015/12/01 11:02:17] <Tobbi> Or even better: This chainsaw is my destiny...
[2015/12/01 11:02:41] <brmbrmcar> A saw on a chain?
[2015/12/01 11:03:10] <Tobbi> Shut up and cut with me.
[2015/12/01 11:03:48] <brmbrmcar> Cut what?

[2015/12/01 11:26:35] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: But that wouldn't fit in with the "Jesus with an axe" kind of thing.
[2015/12/01 11:26:47] <brmbrmcar> Aww.
[2015/12/01 11:27:27] <brmbrmcar> What year was Jesus really born?
[2015/12/01 11:27:33] <brmbrmcar> Don't say 0.
[2015/12/01 11:30:04] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Who knows...Why is it so important...for all I know...he never existed in his form...
[2015/12/01 11:30:10] <Tobbi> *this*
[2015/12/01 11:32:50] <jesusalva> Of course 0 it wasn't. If it was year 0, you could say Jesus didn't existed 'cause there is no year 0 on the calendar, we go straight from 1AD to 1BC.
[2015/12/01 11:33:02] <jesusalva> So roman maths aside
[2015/12/01 11:33:39] <brmbrmcar> I  know, jesusalva.
[2015/12/01 11:35:44] <brmbrmcar> I was born in 2014.

[2015/12/01 11:45:32] <brmbrmcar> Well...
[2015/12/01 11:46:11] <brmbrmcar> Last year they under-estimated the intelligence of 6 year olds.
[2015/12/01 11:46:38] <brmbrmcar> But this time, they have knocked stuff off the servers.

[2015/12/01 12:12:03] <Hume2> Tobbi: I found two levels on the forum, so I put them to Incubator island.
[2015/12/01 12:12:09] <Tobbi> Hume2: Which ones?
[2015/12/01 12:12:13] <Tobbi> Oh, anyway.
[2015/12/01 12:12:34] <Tobbi> Hume2: Those aren't in Bonus Island 3?
[2015/12/01 12:12:53] <Hume2> Tobbi: No, they aren't. I don't know why.
[2015/12/01 12:13:03] <Tobbi> Okay, then it's good!
[2015/12/01 12:20:03] <Tobbi> Hume2: Behind the glaciers definitely is in bonus island 3.
[2015/12/01 12:21:45] <Hume2> Tobbi: How i couldn't notice that? You're right.
[2015/12/01 12:22:21] <Hume2> Maybe because I thought that "Behind the glaciers" can't be "Po ledovcích".
[2015/12/01 12:23:02] <Tobbi> Hume2: Issue with the Czech translation?
[2015/12/01 12:23:06] <Tobbi> Fix it on tx then.
[2015/12/01 12:23:19] <Hume2> Tobbi: I like this translation.
[2015/12/01 12:23:31] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/12/01 12:23:34] <Hume2> It's not exact, but suitable.
[2015/12/01 12:25:00] <Tobbi> Hume2: Could you try downloading the Czech translation file for world1, then put it in the right place and see if the dialogue between penny and tux gets translated?
[2015/12/01 12:25:03] <Tobbi> Just want to make sure that it does
[2015/12/01 12:25:43] <Tobbi> then of course reset your index to HEAD
[2015/12/01 12:26:11] <Hume2> Tobbi: How do I download it?

[2015/12/01 12:54:06] <Tobbi> Interesting.
[2015/12/01 12:55:57] <mt> fyi, I could set you notifico up for the flexlay repo
[2015/12/01 12:56:18] <mt> but since I'm not admin anymore I can't add it to github's hooks
[2015/12/01 12:56:19] <Hume2> Tobbi: will do.
[2015/12/01 12:56:27] <brmbrmcar> Notifico is annoying.
[2015/12/01 12:56:39] <mt> why?
[2015/12/01 12:56:49] <mt> github-bot is more annoying

[2015/12/01 12:59:41] <mt> Why?
[2015/12/01 12:59:52] <mt> (it shouldn't)
[2015/12/01 13:00:05] <brmbrmcar> It feels so unnatural.
[2015/12/01 13:00:20] <brmbrmcar> And the bots have such wierd names.
[2015/12/01 13:00:39] <mt> they have to so that noone steals their names
[2015/12/01 13:00:44] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: OCD or Autism?
[2015/12/01 13:01:04] @ brmbrmcar is now known as Not-6fa5

[2015/12/01 13:02:59] <brmbrmcar> mt: Yeah.
[2015/12/01 13:03:12] <brmbrmcar> And that is why I don't approve of Notifico.
[2015/12/01 13:03:47] <mt> The thing is, Notifico's source code is available, the code of those bots isn't
[2015/12/01 13:04:06] <brmbrmcar> Hmmm...
[2015/12/01 13:04:37] <brmbrmcar> I mean, I do trust Notifico is genuine, but that could be a trap elsewhere.
[2015/12/01 13:05:11] <brmbrmcar> So where is the source?
[2015/12/01 13:05:32] <mt> https://github.com/notifico/notifico
[2015/12/01 13:05:53] <Tobbi> Translating "Graveyard Shift" as "Nachtschicht" in the Halloween levels make them sound a lot less scary :D
[2015/12/01 13:06:48] <brmbrmcar> Why is everything on GitHub?
[2015/12/01 13:07:00] <Tobbi> Because github is the best...
[2015/12/01 13:07:13] <mt> Because nobody wants to use MS CodePlex
[2015/12/01 13:07:20] <Tobbi> ...or google code.
[2015/12/01 13:07:25] <Tobbi> Oh, wait that doesn't exist anymore.
[2015/12/01 13:07:27] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/01 13:07:38] <mt> and people are just starting to use GitLab(.com| CE| EE)
[2015/12/01 13:08:31] <brmbrmcar> Makeyour own site for it. :D
[2015/12/01 13:09:06] <mt> tbh I'd probably use GitLab CE for self-hosting
[2015/12/01 13:09:43] <brmbrmcar> GitHub charges people for stuff!
[2015/12/01 13:10:21] <mt> then use GitLab.com, afaik they don't have priced services yet
[2015/12/01 13:12:23] <brmbrmcar> Yeah, but...
[2015/12/01 13:12:32] <brmbrmcar> I want my own git site!
[2015/12/01 13:12:41] <mt> then get a VPS or a dedi
[2015/12/01 13:12:51] <mt> and host GitLab CE on it
[2015/12/01 13:13:12] <mt> or simply the C-based gitweb
[2015/12/01 13:13:26] <mt> or Gogs
[2015/12/01 13:13:40] <brmbrmcar> Not GitHub!
[2015/12/01 13:13:45] <brmbrmcar> Or GitLab!
[2015/12/01 13:14:04] <mt> GitLab CE is open-source, fwiw
[2015/12/01 13:14:15] <brmbrmcar> GitHub is not.
[2015/12/01 13:14:32] <Tobbi> mt: Is Gitlab CE better than gogs in terms of resource usage?
[2015/12/01 13:14:35] <brmbrmcar> As far as I know of.
[2015/12/01 13:14:36] <Tobbi> Can it run on a rbp
[2015/12/01 13:15:00] <mt> dunno
[2015/12/01 13:15:17] <Tobbi> oh, rbp 2...they have setup instructions for that.
[2015/12/01 13:15:24] <Tobbi> I should probably get myself a rbp 2
[2015/12/01 13:15:30] <mt> get and rbp 0
[2015/12/01 13:15:36] <mt> it's just $5
[2015/12/01 13:16:19] <brmbrmcar> Why pay?
[2015/12/01 13:16:20] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/01 13:16:34] <mt> EUR5.61 with 19% VAT in Germany ;)
[2015/12/01 13:16:47] <Tobbi> I wouldn't run a git server on that...
[2015/12/01 13:16:51] <Tobbi> Might kill itself.
[2015/12/01 13:16:53] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/01 13:17:14] <mt> it's "40x faster than the first-gen Pi B"
[2015/12/01 13:17:24] <Tobbi> mt: What? :D
[2015/12/01 13:17:36] <Tobbi> mt: How does it compare against RBP 2?

[2015/12/01 13:18:35] <Tobbi> I believe I am running a rbp first gen here...
[2015/12/01 13:18:54] <Tobbi> mt: What about electricity-wise? Shouldn't use as much of that, should it?
[2015/12/01 13:18:59] <mt> when they're available in Germany I'll probably get some for running Tor relays
[2015/12/01 13:19:35] <mt> well 5V 500mA is enough for running a Pi (even tho 800mA is probably better), so 2.5W

[2015/12/01 18:00:13] <head8debian> Good evening Tobbi and jesusalva and the rest of the team.
[2015/12/01 18:00:27] <Tobbi> hello head8debian, may the schwartz be with you.
[2015/12/01 18:00:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: I just realized i have a party to go to the day of our release.
[2015/12/01 18:00:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: What kind of brand is that?
[2015/12/01 18:00:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: Just a reference to Spaceballs.
[2015/12/01 18:00:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: So, could we get this release done early? I guess i could try to get up early/
[2015/12/01 18:01:08] <head8debian> I did say *try*.
[2015/12/01 18:01:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: What's early for you?
[2015/12/01 18:04:29] <Tobbi> head8debian: what time is it now, how many hours are you ahead of me?
[2015/12/01 18:05:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its 18:00 here. Early would be 6:00 for me... i'd have about an hour and a half to help before having to go out.
[2015/12/01 18:05:28] <Tobbi> So, that would be noon for me, right?
[2015/12/01 18:05:36] <head8debian> Uhm, would it?
[2015/12/01 18:05:49] <Tobbi> head8debian: it's midnight for me right now
[2015/12/01 18:06:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Then it would be.
[2015/12/01 18:06:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: We certainly could do the release at noon.
[2015/12/01 18:06:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: We should create a release planning task list.
[2015/12/01 18:07:11] <Tobbi> Make sure we don't forget stuff.
[2015/12/01 18:07:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: Good idea
[2015/12/01 18:08:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: Shall I create an issue?
[2015/12/01 18:08:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: I should be able to get up at that time as long as my family doesn't hear me....
[2015/12/01 18:08:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sure.
[2015/12/01 18:08:33] <Tobbi> head8debian: When do you normally get up?
[2015/12/01 18:09:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: 7:30, but then im not available untill rightly 10:00
[2015/12/01 18:09:29] <head8debian> roughly*
[2015/12/01 18:09:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: And i will have from 10:00 to 12:00 open.
[2015/12/01 18:10:05] <Tobbi> Hmm... 10am...is 4pm here...
[2015/12/01 18:10:07] <Tobbi> So, maybe...
[2015/12/01 18:11:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whatever you want to do. I don't really like getting up early...
[2015/12/01 18:11:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, let's target 4pm
[2015/12/01 18:11:58] <Tobbi> Leaves us more time...
[2015/12/01 18:12:10] <Tobbi> 10am for you.
[2015/12/01 18:12:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok.
[2015/12/01 18:12:57] <Tobbi> Good.
[2015/12/01 18:13:01] <Tobbi> And it's a sunday...

[2015/12/01 18:29:15] <maths22> Tobbi: That won't change.  Sorry, but CPack doesn't support it (however, there will be an uninstall button in the folder as well)

[2015/12/01 18:29:29] <Tobbi> I don't really mind.
[2015/12/01 18:30:02] <maths22> I have also updated the numbering scheme (so the lastest version is actually 0.3.5.447)
[2015/12/01 18:30:13] <Tobbi> I'm so damn happy when this release is out of the door...

[2015/12/01 18:30:38] <Tobbi> Ah!
[2015/12/01 18:31:26] <maths22> The window heading has "v0.3.5-447-g58285e5"
[2015/12/01 18:31:50] <Tobbi> maths22: But should have 0.4.0 as soon as that's out the door, right? aka, properly tagged...
[2015/12/01 18:32:30] <Tobbi> maths22: Is there anything else I might have forgotten on that release list?
[2015/12/01 18:32:33] <maths22> Tobbi: exactly.  It relies on the git tag to get a version number
[2015/12/01 18:33:03] <maths22> I don't think so.  I'm going to try to get builds working very soon
[2015/12/01 18:34:13] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/12/01 18:34:46] <maths22> And my changes break travis.  Fixing... (This is why it went on its own branch)

[2015/12/02 09:17:16] <Tobbi> hey maths22
[2015/12/02 09:17:30] <maths22> That underscore thing is odd
[2015/12/02 09:18:16] <Tobbi> maths22: git describe gives me 0_3_5-502-gc997b70
[2015/12/02 09:18:30] <Tobbi> Maybe it depends on git version?
[2015/12/02 09:18:40] <Tobbi> mine is git version 2.4.9 (Apple Git-60)
[2015/12/02 09:21:19] <maths22> Tobbi: can you paste the output of "git tag" for me?
[2015/12/02 09:21:25] <maths22> (In a pastebin or something)
[2015/12/02 09:21:56] <Tobbi> maths22: http://pastebin.com/Ae87yFLy I guess I understand now.
[2015/12/02 09:22:05] <Tobbi> So, I might have old tags that haven|t been cleaned up.
[2015/12/02 09:22:10] <maths22> Correct
[2015/12/02 09:22:27] <Tobbi> hrm...
[2015/12/02 09:22:31] <maths22> Leave the underscore splitter in the cmake file, but it isn't actually necessary
[2015/12/02 09:22:44] <Tobbi> Okay, I will try to clean them up.
[2015/12/02 09:23:08] <maths22> I predict you will get different output once you do that
[2015/12/02 09:23:24] <maths22> (I had thought you had underscores instead of dashes, which would be a git issue)
[2015/12/02 09:23:41] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/12/02 09:24:28] <Tobbi> I thought so too...I didn|t think of tags.
[2015/12/02 09:26:47] <Tobbi> Yup, now it says v0.3.5-502-gc997b70
[2015/12/02 09:26:50] <Tobbi> Which seems to be good

[2015/12/02 12:38:24] <brmbrmcar> Any way of getting in new index?

[2015/12/02 12:46:11] <brmbrmcar> I don't know much in this area.
[2015/12/02 12:55:14] <brmbrmcar> Maybe they would actually need to be implemented into the SuperTux source code to work.

[2015/12/02 13:07:03] <Hume2> This is a list of commands for Tux.
[2015/12/02 13:07:13] <brmbrmcar> Thanks.
[2015/12/02 13:07:39] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It looks like Tobbi knows a lot, but not everything.
[2015/12/02 13:07:43] <brmbrmcar> I want to try adding set_bonus.
[2015/12/02 13:08:24] <Hume2> I'll try to add this command here.
[2015/12/02 13:09:11] <brmbrmcar> Where are these things defined?
[2015/12/02 13:09:42] <brmbrmcar> Because I know that just typing in set_bonus is never going to work.
[2015/12/02 13:11:04] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/src/object/player.cpp
[2015/12/02 13:11:52] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Thanks. Looks very long.
[2015/12/02 13:12:26] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Is that what you usually talk about with Tobbi?
[2015/12/02 13:12:55] <brmbrmcar> Noo.
[2015/12/02 13:13:31] <brmbrmcar> Will just removing all the ifs and just running it work?
[2015/12/02 13:13:44] <brmbrmcar> Just return add_bonus(type);
[2015/12/02 13:14:48] <Hume2> add_bonus("none") should work another way then set_bonus(none), shouldn't it?
[2015/12/02 13:15:29] <brmbrmcar> Yes. But add_bonus("none") doesn't work.
[2015/12/02 13:15:58] <Hume2> :D That's what I'm now working on.
[2015/12/02 13:16:59] <brmbrmcar> Good.
[2015/12/02 13:17:20] <brmbrmcar> Worst scripting ever https://github.com/brmbrmcar/supertux/commit/20d576a5d8b5c20d08d1ed147d69e3f23fd90b80.
[2015/12/02 13:17:27] <brmbrmcar> Not even complete.
[2015/12/02 13:18:13] <leyyin> why does your function accept a parameter that you are not using?
[2015/12/02 13:18:25] <mt> brmbrmcar: I hope you'll reword your commit messages when you're done
[2015/12/02 13:18:45] <brmbrmcar> That code just disabled everything.
[2015/12/02 13:23:54] <brmbrmcar> A poor none bonus method could be if fireflower etc shrink twice, growup once, none never.
[2015/12/02 13:24:37] <Karkus> That is true. Well done.
[2015/12/02 13:24:53] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I have it nearly done. I'm just testing it.

[2015/12/02 13:25:37] <brmbrmcar> What was your fix?
[2015/12/02 13:26:29] <Hume2> *sigh*
[2015/12/02 13:26:45] <Hume2> It's more complicated.
[2015/12/02 13:27:23] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Do never suggest your way to Tobbi. Good advice.
[2015/12/02 13:28:41] <brmbrmcar> Yours probably works. Mine probably will blow up.
[2015/12/02 13:32:22] <Hume2> The squirel seems more complicated than I thought...

[2015/12/02 13:59:47] <Tobbi> I don't normally like when people talk behind my back or the equivalent on IRC.
[2015/12/02 13:59:56] <Tobbi> That's rude.
[2015/12/02 14:00:28] <vpx> Hey Tobbi
[2015/12/02 14:00:36] <Tobbi> Hello.
[2015/12/02 14:00:40] <Tobbi> vpx: New?
[2015/12/02 14:00:50] <vpx> to IRC, yes
[2015/12/02 14:00:55] <Tobbi> Ah, nice.
[2015/12/02 14:01:07] <vpx> I've been poking around the SuperTux code
[2015/12/02 14:01:18] <vpx> and I was trying to understand how the console scripts work
[2015/12/02 14:01:25] <Tobbi> leyyin, Am I really that wrong for being OCD'ish about the code quality?
[2015/12/02 14:01:46] <leyyin> no, open source projects have a a bad reputation for code quality....
[2015/12/02 14:01:51] <vpx> shouldn't I be able to call sector.set_gravity( float ) from the console?
[2015/12/02 14:02:08] <vpx> they do, but they shouldn't ..
[2015/12/02 14:02:09] <Tobbi> leyyin, Bad reputation meaning "being slaggish"?
[2015/12/02 14:02:31] <leyyin> lacking in consistency, ugly code, etc
[2015/12/02 14:02:40] <Tobbi> leyyin, SuperTux is lacking in consistency as well.
[2015/12/02 14:02:52] <Tobbi> As for ugly code...I don't know. I've been trying to avoid this.
[2015/12/02 14:03:33] <leyyin> look at openssl :D
[2015/12/02 14:03:38] <leyyin> so nice
[2015/12/02 14:03:45] <Tobbi> vpx, If it isn't there, you can program it in. An example should be in the most recent commits.
[2015/12/02 14:03:51] <vpx> hmm
[2015/12/02 14:04:02] <vpx> the funcion set_gravity is in scripting/ssector.hpp
[2015/12/02 14:04:05] <vpx> as well as the sector file itself
[2015/12/02 14:04:09] <Tobbi> leyyin, I am so burnt out...
[2015/12/02 14:04:16] <Tobbi> I don't know anything about motivation...
[2015/12/02 14:04:18] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/02 14:04:49] <vpx> but the console still says that the index 'set_gravity' does not exist
[2015/12/02 14:05:04] <Tobbi> A squirrel wrapper needs to exist.
[2015/12/02 14:05:33] <vpx> from what I understand, isn't that the src/scripting/ssector.hpp
[2015/12/02 14:05:34] <vpx> ?»
[2015/12/02 14:05:35] <leyyin> Tobbi, so I am like your advisor or something?
[2015/12/02 14:05:46] <Tobbi> leyyin, Yes... :P
[2015/12/02 14:05:56] <Tobbi> leyyin, No, you're not...never mind.
[2015/12/02 14:06:10] <Tobbi> vpx, No, it isn't.

[2015/12/02 14:08:10] <Tobbi> src/scripting/wrapper.cpp
[2015/12/02 14:08:23] <Tobbi> If you want to help, create such a wrapper for that function above that you miss.
[2015/12/02 14:11:05] <vpx> Oh, i didn't notice that file
[2015/12/02 14:11:08] <vpx> Will take a look, thanks
[2015/12/02 14:11:17] <Tobbi> vpx, If you do, please create a pull request.
[2015/12/02 14:11:24] <Tobbi> We can merge that in before the release in 3 weeks.
[2015/12/02 14:11:47] <vpx> I will if I manage to make this work right
[2015/12/02 14:13:27] <Tobbi> leyyin, I will let some other person lead SuperTux for a while. If Hume or brmbrmcar think they can be better project leaders than me, fine...
[2015/12/02 14:13:33] <Tobbi> No need to stress myself over it.

[2015/12/02 14:47:11] <Tobbi> Karkus, mt: If people have a problem with me, they are free to a) leave the project or b) tell me in the face...
[2015/12/02 14:47:56] <Tobbi> I'd prefer 1) because complains about me are most likely the sign that there's something wrong with the person having problems with me.
[2015/12/02 14:48:01] <Tobbi> I. am. flawless.
[2015/12/02 14:48:36] <Karkus> That's a quote to keep :D
[2015/12/02 14:48:54] <Tobbi> Karkus, I have it hanging above my bed since I was born.
[2015/12/02 14:49:21] <brmbrmcar> I will resist an annoying comment.
[2015/12/02 14:49:23] <Karkus> You could probably convince me that was true :P
[2015/12/02 14:49:27] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/02 14:49:29] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Please do
[2015/12/02 14:49:37] <brmbrmcar> Well...
[2015/12/02 14:50:01] <Tobbi> Karkus, To be honest, I really have a problem with authority.
[2015/12/02 14:50:06] <Tobbi> And that's a problem in itself.
[2015/12/02 14:50:27] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi got a and 1 confused, and then said he was flawless.
[2015/12/02 14:51:03] <brmbrmcar> It depends what he means by "flawless".

[2015/12/02 17:32:26] <Tobbi_> head8debian: Have you ever put a cow upside-down?

[2015/12/02 17:33:16] <Tobbi_> head8debian: But, in order to prevent accidents, you need to find out when it kills them and when it doesn't.
[2015/12/02 17:33:27] <Tobbi_> Because, if a cow accidentally gets turned upside down, or inside out...
[2015/12/02 17:33:32] <Tobbi_> Well...you know what to do.
[2015/12/02 17:33:59] <head8debian> Tobbi_: You cannot do anything when they get a twisted stomach. If we could we would love to know how.
[2015/12/02 17:34:32] <Tobbi_> head8debian: All you need is a lot of hot air pressure... then the cow inflates and the stomach untwists...
[2015/12/02 17:34:42] <Tobbi_> Actually, I am making that up as I go along.

[2015/12/03 10:29:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: Hey.
[2015/12/03 10:30:08] <head8debian> maths22: So, you are going to work on a OSX build today?
[2015/12/03 10:30:44] <Tobbi> hello foot9ubuntu

[2015/12/03 10:35:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: ...
[2015/12/03 10:35:39] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Will you be civil today and not be getting on our nerves?
[2015/12/03 10:36:19] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/12/03 10:36:37] <brmbrmcar> Thw Windsows builds aren't working on Wine...
[2015/12/03 10:36:47] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Error message?
[2015/12/03 10:37:00] <brmbrmcar> None.
[2015/12/03 10:37:14] <brmbrmcar> It compiles, but doesn't sart.
[2015/12/03 10:37:28] <brmbrmcar> bin/supertux2.exe
[2015/12/03 10:37:30] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: That should still give you an error message.
[2015/12/03 10:37:42] <brmbrmcar> How?
[2015/12/03 10:37:45] <brmbrmcar> Where?
[2015/12/03 10:38:30] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How do you start the build?
[2015/12/03 10:38:42] <brmbrmcar> I just downloaded it.
[2015/12/03 10:39:16] <brmbrmcar> I opened he file,and followed the instructions.
[2015/12/03 10:39:41] <brmbrmcar> Open with Wine.
[2015/12/03 10:43:55] <leyyin> Tobbi, do you want to hear something funny?
[2015/12/03 10:44:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: Sure.
[2015/12/03 10:45:06] <leyyin> this year at my university, the 'Security' course is taught by Bitdefender (the anti-virus company), well they got good teachers, because last summer they got caught with having stored PLAIN PASSWORDS http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/07/31/bitdefender-hacked/
[2015/12/03 10:45:08] <leyyin> idiots
[2015/12/03 10:45:40] <leyyin> how the heck can you store plain text passwords, and you are a security firm......
[2015/12/03 10:45:47] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/03 10:45:58] <leyyin> *this summer
[2015/12/03 10:46:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: How comes they even let outside companies teach a security course at a university?
[2015/12/03 10:46:38] <leyyin> because we are corporate slaves
[2015/12/03 10:46:53] <leyyin> we have 3-4 (optional courses) taught by people from corporations
[2015/12/03 10:47:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: At least they're optional...
[2015/12/03 10:48:02] <Tobbi> leyyin: Our small university is too small to be corporate slaves anyway...
[2015/12/03 10:49:03] <leyyin> well it depends on semester, you got too choose some optional courses
[2015/12/03 10:49:08] <leyyin> 2 out of 6 courses
[2015/12/03 10:49:13] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/12/03 10:49:27] <Tobbi> leyyin: Want to know what I noticed? I worry too much :P
[2015/12/03 10:49:43] <leyyin> so this is unheard off in Germany? having corporations teach a course?
[2015/12/03 10:49:57] <leyyin> do you have ads at your university?
[2015/12/03 10:49:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: Probably not... But it's not common, I'd think.
[2015/12/03 10:50:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: No?
[2015/12/03 10:50:08] <leyyin> by corporations ? :D
[2015/12/03 10:50:11] <leyyin> we have them too
[2015/12/03 10:50:22] <Tobbi> leyyin: Universities are not private...
[2015/12/03 10:50:29] <leyyin> yeah
[2015/12/03 10:50:32] <leyyin> this one too
[2015/12/03 10:50:38] <Tobbi> That's weird.
[2015/12/03 10:50:39] <leyyin> but we got ads by corporations :D
[2015/12/03 10:50:52] <leyyin> "Check out our awesome company"
[2015/12/03 10:50:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: That is totally mental.
[2015/12/03 10:50:55] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/03 10:51:10] <leyyin> even in big lecture rooms
[2015/12/03 10:51:14] <leyyin> in front of the class
[2015/12/03 10:51:28] <brmbrmcar> Can I put up an ad?
[2015/12/03 10:51:45] <leyyin> Tobbi, and friends think I am crazy when I tell them this is not normal :D
[2015/12/03 10:52:13] <Tobbi> leyyin: Okay, tell them to come to the Fachhochschule Flensburg. There are no ads, never...
[2015/12/03 10:52:21] <Tobbi> leyyin: We do, however, have a list of openings...
[2015/12/03 10:52:31] <Tobbi> But that's not the same.
[2015/12/03 10:53:51] <leyyin> list of openings?
[2015/12/03 10:54:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: ubuntu is not debian, and ubuntu is still not stuck on version 9.
[2015/12/03 10:54:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: job openings...
[2015/12/03 10:54:32] <Tobbi> So, companies post their openings on to a blackboard.
[2015/12/03 10:54:40] <leyyin> ah ok, that is totally different
[2015/12/03 10:55:02] <brmbrmcar> Debian is better than Ubuntu.
[2015/12/03 10:55:18] <leyyin> linux is better than debian
[2015/12/03 10:55:45] <leyyin> Tobbi, thank you for making me feel normal :D
[2015/12/03 10:55:52] <leyyin> so I am not crazy when I am against those ads
[2015/12/03 10:56:02] <Tobbi> leyyin: Normal depends on your definition...
[2015/12/03 10:56:14] <brmbrmcar> Debian is Linux.
[2015/12/03 10:56:21] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, impossible
[2015/12/03 10:56:27] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, debian is a fork of windows
[2015/12/03 10:56:31] <brmbrmcar> Linux distro
[2015/12/03 10:56:38] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, not true
[2015/12/03 10:56:46] <brmbrmcar> leyyin: You are messing with me.
[2015/12/03 10:56:55] <leyyin> not true either :D
[2015/12/03 10:57:00] <brmbrmcar> I HATE WINDOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[2015/12/03 10:58:56] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You're messing with yourself.
[2015/12/03 10:59:17] <brmbrmcar> Nope.
[2015/12/03 10:59:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: Do these outside lecturers advertise their company?
[2015/12/03 10:59:31] <leyyin> Tobbi, idk, I never went to one
[2015/12/03 10:59:32] <leyyin> Tobbi, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[2015/12/03 10:59:37] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2015/12/03 10:59:43] <leyyin> [17:56:30] <@Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You're messing with yourself.
[2015/12/03 10:59:53] <brmbrmcar> 15:57:17 < leyyin> [17:56:30] <@Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You're messing with yourself.
[2015/12/03 11:00:10] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, we had one lecturer who was the boss of spielen.de, an online platform for online games...
[2015/12/03 11:00:11] <brmbrmcar> leyyin started it!
[2015/12/03 11:00:24] <Tobbi> But he told us something about how to run a company etc.
[2015/12/03 11:00:26] <maths22> head8debian: Hopefully
[2015/12/03 11:00:33] <Tobbi> And did not advertise it in any way.
[2015/12/03 11:00:56] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Okay, so, if you mess with me, I will kick you, leyyin has free reign...but he is a respected member of this community.
[2015/12/03 11:00:59] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Which file, and what is the error?
[2015/12/03 11:01:34] <leyyin> hmm, I am an asshole, why I am respected thought
[2015/12/03 11:01:38] <leyyin> weird people :D
[2015/12/03 11:02:08] <Tobbi> leyyin: I can talk normally with you, thus you're respected.
[2015/12/03 11:02:14] <brmbrmcar> maths22: How do you get the errr message?
[2015/12/03 11:02:34] <brmbrmcar> maths22: I booted from bin/supertux2.exe
[2015/12/03 11:02:49] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Which installer version?
[2015/12/03 11:03:34] <brmbrmcar> I don't know. But I used SuperTux-0.3.5.507-win32.msi.
[2015/12/03 11:03:42] <maths22> That answers my question
[2015/12/03 11:03:49] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/03 11:04:24] <maths22> Try running it through the command line 'wine /path/to/bin/supertux2.exe'
[2015/12/03 11:04:32] <maths22> That should give you the error message
[2015/12/03 11:04:45] <maths22> (Otherwise, I'll try wine later today when I am running linux)

[2015/12/03 11:39:16] <Tobbi> We could have a file there that includes the latest version.
[2015/12/03 11:39:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: Or should i teach you about computer security? :D
[2015/12/03 11:39:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: No.
[2015/12/03 11:40:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok....
[2015/12/03 11:40:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't know anything about getting taught.
[2015/12/03 11:41:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: I was always bad at school.
[2015/12/03 11:41:18] <head8debian> Not that im the greatest security teacher... i know enough to keep Tobbi out of my system though. :D
[2015/12/03 11:41:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Don't bet on it.
[2015/12/03 11:42:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: I had a GPA of C in high school.
[2015/12/03 11:42:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: Thats why i don't run your bash scripts.

[2015/12/03 11:44:43] <Tobbi> But we can try.

[2015/12/03 11:47:45] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/12/03 11:48:04] <Tobbi> I don't.
[2015/12/03 11:48:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Does that have the same implications?

[2015/12/03 11:49:45] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/03 11:49:54] <Tobbi> I definitely like it better than this.
[2015/12/03 11:49:59] <head8debian> manipulation... :P
[2015/12/03 11:50:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am prone to that.
[2015/12/03 11:50:20] <head8debian> I honestly did figure that you would if i mentioned it. :)
[2015/12/03 11:50:33] <Tobbi> Wow, sometimes I just use words which I only kind of remember the meaning of.
[2015/12/03 11:50:36] <Tobbi> And later verify them.
[2015/12/03 11:50:51] <head8debian> ...
[2015/12/03 11:51:59] <brmbrmcar> Don't try and translate the links, you know that will not work...
[2015/12/03 11:54:49] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Of course they don't work!
[2015/12/03 11:55:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: When I comment on flexlay, notifico doesn't notify
[2015/12/03 11:55:22] <Tobbi> hmm, okay.

[2015/12/03 11:56:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: We could...
[2015/12/03 11:56:15] <Tobbi> how does the old editor do it?
[2015/12/03 11:56:25] <Tobbi> Can anyone of you guys check?
[2015/12/03 11:56:30] <Karkus> Just tiles them lots of times
[2015/12/03 11:56:38] <Karkus> I took a screen shot
[2015/12/03 11:57:08] <brmbrmcar> Which old editor?
[2015/12/03 11:57:33] <Tobbi> Oh, so that's the old one...
[2015/12/03 11:57:34] <Tobbi> right...
[2015/12/03 11:57:36] <Tobbi> of course.
[2015/12/03 11:57:45] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'm going to tranfer all the labels from supertux to flexlay, is that okay?
[2015/12/03 11:57:48] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/12/03 11:57:58] <Tobbi> makes sense.
[2015/12/03 11:58:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's the old one, yes
[2015/12/03 11:58:03] <brmbrmcar> Background shows fine on the 0.3.4-git one.
[2015/12/03 11:58:20] <Tobbi> tomorrow's my graduation party...

[2015/12/03 11:58:36] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Shows fine?
[2015/12/03 11:58:47] <Karkus> Why '"party"'?
[2015/12/03 11:59:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: Because it's just a graduation celebration with the president of the university and all graduates.
[2015/12/03 11:59:19] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: I mean on the standard editor.
[2015/12/03 11:59:20] <Tobbi> And family members.
[2015/12/03 11:59:28] <Tobbi> My father'll attend as well...
[2015/12/03 11:59:35] <Tobbi> And I had to debrief him on proper conduct.
[2015/12/03 11:59:45] <Karkus> : )
[2015/12/03 12:00:13] <mt> Karkus: well, notifico isn't set up for flexlay
[2015/12/03 12:00:13] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Please can you show me what 'shows fine' means (with a screenshot)
[2015/12/03 12:00:21] <Karkus> mt: How can I set it up?
[2015/12/03 12:00:23] <mt> and  github's commit bot doesn't announce comments
[2015/12/03 12:00:33] <mt> I can set up an hook URL
[2015/12/03 12:00:41] <mt> and then give it to Tobbi in PM
[2015/12/03 12:00:58] <mt> (or do you happen to have admin access to the flexlay repo)
[2015/12/03 12:01:14] <Karkus> Admin access?
[2015/12/03 12:01:15] <mt> because anyone with access to it could spam the channel using the notifico bots
[2015/12/03 12:01:45] <Karkus> I am a 'Contributor'

[2015/12/03 12:02:14] <mt> then you don't have admin access
[2015/12/03 12:02:31] <Tobbi> One moment.
[2015/12/03 12:02:35] <Tobbi> Let me see if Karkus has.
[2015/12/03 12:02:56] <brmbrmcar> Contributor? For what?
[2015/12/03 12:03:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: I added you to the admin group.
[2015/12/03 12:04:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, thanks :D

[2015/12/03 12:18:48] <mt> commit #243: "Edit by @maxteufel, 2015-12-03 16:15 UTC: Added Arch Linux to list of people to notify"
[2015/12/03 12:19:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yeah, that resource library idea is a minor one... :P
[2015/12/03 12:19:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: Shouldn't be too difficult though.
[2015/12/03 12:19:51] <Tobbi> That's right.
[2015/12/03 12:23:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Should it search the whole data directory?
[2015/12/03 12:24:12] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could search the directories for certain things...data/image for sprite files, data/music for ogg, right?
[2015/12/03 12:24:22] <Tobbi> Is faster than searching data/ fullz.
[2015/12/03 12:24:23] <Tobbi> fully
[2015/12/03 12:24:30] <Karkus> Yep
[2015/12/03 12:25:58] <mt> re people to ping about release I guess that'd also be @amigadave (https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/packager/amigadave/) and possibly @Vincent-C
[2015/12/03 12:27:17] <mt> (https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=Vincent+Cheng) for the latter
[2015/12/03 12:27:20] <Tobbi> mt: Add them to the release issue.
[2015/12/03 12:28:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: Does the game search the datadir for .sprite files?
[2015/12/03 12:28:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, it doesn't. The sprite files are hardcoded within the game.
[2015/12/03 12:29:05] <Tobbi> *sprite file paths
[2015/12/03 12:29:30] <Karkus> Hmmm, okay

[2015/12/03 12:31:11] <Karkus> mt: I've wondered that too...
[2015/12/03 12:31:19] <Tobbi> mt: Well, you mentioned yourself, did it notify you?
[2015/12/03 12:31:44] <mt> no, that's not expected because I'm watching the repository anyway
[2015/12/03 12:31:56] <mt> and you also don't get a notification for comments you write
[2015/12/03 12:32:04] <Tobbi> right
[2015/12/03 12:35:58] <Karkus> I edited my comment, mt. Did you get an email?
[2015/12/03 12:36:52] <mt> no
[2015/12/03 12:37:16] <Karkus> There you have it, then
[2015/12/03 12:37:32] <mt> if just editing comments generates an email you'd also have gotten one about my change ;)

[2015/12/03 12:49:18] <Tobbi> mt, Hume2: We should, however, note non-visible changes as something like "Engine improvements" etc.
[2015/12/03 12:49:32] <mt> yeah
[2015/12/03 12:49:47] <Hume2> Yes, you can just write -Code improvements.

[2015/12/03 12:50:00] <Hume2> Or that. And that stands for all.
[2015/12/03 12:50:08] <Tobbi> Do I put myself as "Project lead"? :P
[2015/12/03 12:50:21] <Tobbi> I'd rather not take on that role, but others attribute it to me :D

[2015/12/03 12:54:35] <Tobbi> maths22: What changes would you do that has an effect on XP?
[2015/12/03 12:54:46] <Hume2> However, Windows XP is still better than 10.
[2015/12/03 12:54:47] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Translators do have a lot to translate.
[2015/12/03 12:54:53] <maths22> Tobbi: It's a compiler thing, not a source thing
[2015/12/03 12:54:56] <mt> I'd say: don't even think about supporting unsupported software
[2015/12/03 12:55:02] <brmbrmcar> So, what will it look like?
[2015/12/03 12:55:21] <brmbrmcar> With incomplete translations?
[2015/12/03 12:55:23] <maths22> mt: This is my belief, but I just wanted to check, since Visual Studio 2012+ builds don't run on XP

[2015/12/03 12:55:39] <Tobbi> maths22: If there's a high enough demand for SuperTux on XP, we can create an executable on XP.
[2015/12/03 12:55:45] <Tobbi> But, wait, XP is soo old.
[2015/12/03 12:56:03] <Hume2> ...but better than Windows 7.
[2015/12/03 12:56:04] <mt> if it's more than 'just change one line', forget it?

[2015/12/03 12:56:52] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Vista is just slow. That's all.
[2015/12/03 12:57:08] <Hume2> However, Windows 7 has IQ 7.
[2015/12/03 12:57:32] <brmbrmcar> All Windows is awful.
[2015/12/03 12:57:38] <maths22> I'm using the IE vms to test the installer on old versions, and started with XP (where it didn't run)
[2015/12/03 12:57:41] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2015/12/03 12:57:57] <maths22> I'm now trying 7.  The good thing is it is a clean install, so I will know if any dependencies are missing
[2015/12/03 12:58:11] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/12/03 12:58:23] <maths22> Tobbi: really, I don't care if it runs in Wine
[2015/12/03 12:58:39] <Tobbi> maths22: That's alright... :D We publish native executables anyway.
[2015/12/03 12:58:43] <maths22> We have native linux builds, so if Wine doesn't like it, its not the end of the world
[2015/12/03 12:58:56] <maths22> Tobbi: exactly
[2015/12/03 12:59:00] <brmbrmcar> Yeah, but I prefer running stuff in Wine on Linux.
[2015/12/03 12:59:12] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: ...
[2015/12/03 12:59:14] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Why do you not like the native builds?
[2015/12/03 12:59:51] <brmbrmcar> I can't seem to ever get the linux ones working, and it uses less disk space.
[2015/12/03 13:00:10] <brmbrmcar> Because on Wine you can just throw away the soycre.
[2015/12/03 13:00:24] <Karkus> I dual boot Windows 10, so I can double check that
[2015/12/03 13:00:28] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Linux builds should not include source [binary ones anyways]
[2015/12/03 13:00:53] <maths22> Karkus: Thanks.  I do the same, but I have all the dev tools installed, so the vms give me a nice clean slate
[2015/12/03 13:01:09] <brmbrmcar> Karku:I mean the thing to install from.
[2015/12/03 13:01:18] <brmbrmcar> I meant maths22 then.
[2015/12/03 13:01:26] <Karkus> maths22: Okay
[2015/12/03 13:01:46] <mt> maths22: uh, builds are usually binaries :P
[2015/12/03 13:01:54] <maths22> mt: I know
[2015/12/03 13:02:03] <Tobbi> Not for something like JavaScript :P
[2015/12/03 13:02:05] <maths22> brmbrmcar was confusing me, and I gave a confusing reply back :(
[2015/12/03 13:02:32] <brmbrmcar> maths22: Where is the Linux source file anyway? You know, that tar.gz one.
[2015/12/03 13:02:47] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Not yet being built.
[2015/12/03 13:02:54] <brmbrmcar> OK.

[2015/12/03 13:03:53] <maths22> I'm dissapointed with the installer.  The background graphics don't work in Windows 7

[2015/12/03 13:37:56] <Tobbi> I really have no idea.

[2015/12/03 13:45:35] <Tobbi> uhm...
[2015/12/03 13:45:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, these are the default sprites for badguys, they should stay as they are.

[2015/12/03 13:46:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: yes.
[2015/12/03 13:46:14] <Tobbi> What we need is a general sprite library.
[2015/12/03 13:46:18] <Tobbi> That includes all sprites.
[2015/12/03 13:46:22] <Tobbi> All found ones.
[2015/12/03 13:46:39] <maths22> The current installer creates a system that only works on Windows 10.  That will be fixed tonight

[2015/12/03 13:47:42] <Tobbi> wait a minute.

[2015/12/03 13:48:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Problem is exactly what you pointed out: Directory names don't correlate with badguy names.
[2015/12/03 13:48:33] <Tobbi> So, unfortunately that part of the code needs to stay intact.
[2015/12/03 13:49:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hmm, so where could I get the names from?
[2015/12/03 13:49:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, it's useless hardcoding it in
[2015/12/03 13:49:38] <Tobbi> right.
[2015/12/03 13:50:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: You could use the directory name...
[2015/12/03 13:50:26] <Tobbi> Seems like that's the only thing that can be used.
[2015/12/03 13:50:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is that always correct?
[2015/12/03 13:51:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, it doesn't need to be correct, right? What I am thinking of when I mean "Sprite library" is a window that has a list of categories (maybe the names of the directory) and on the right it displays the sprites found in that directory.
[2015/12/03 13:51:55] <Tobbi> Maybe I haven't thought this through....
[2015/12/03 13:52:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, when you want to specify a sprite for a badguy, the library opens, you select the sprite and it copies its filename.
[2015/12/03 13:53:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Custom badguys?
[2015/12/03 13:53:18] <Hume2> No, just the sprites.
[2015/12/03 13:53:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, not in terms of behaviour, but in terms of how they look.
[2015/12/03 13:53:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: badguys have a sprite property in the lisp file.
[2015/12/03 13:53:40] <Karkus> Is that a useful thing though?
[2015/12/03 13:53:43] <Tobbi> That defines how the badguy looks...
[2015/12/03 13:53:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't know. But it's better than having to copy the filename to the sprite file, right?
[2015/12/03 13:54:00] <Tobbi> At least IMO
[2015/12/03 13:54:07] <brmbrmcar> There should be something to accept define files indata levels.
[2015/12/03 13:54:54] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: That's a lot of words, but not a lot of sense
[2015/12/03 13:55:05] <brmbrmcar> You know, like .c files.
[2015/12/03 13:55:24] <brmbrmcar> That you can add into like a worldmap.
[2015/12/03 13:56:07] <Tobbi> Oh no.
[2015/12/03 13:56:12] <Tobbi> That would be a huge security risk.
[2015/12/03 13:56:27] <brmbrmcar> Hacking?#
[2015/12/03 13:56:44] <Tobbi> Also, a lot of code overlay...
[2015/12/03 13:56:46] <brmbrmcar> remove Windows
[2015/12/03 13:56:51] <Tobbi> we'd need to integrate a c parser...
[2015/12/03 13:56:52] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: C is a comiled language != scripting
[2015/12/03 13:56:54] <Tobbi> or compiler...
[2015/12/03 13:57:48] <brmbrmcar> How about something that allows more customisability, but not computer destruction.
[2015/12/03 13:59:00] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: We have squirrel, what else do we need?
[2015/12/03 13:59:24] <Tobbi> We should enhance our scripting capabilities after 0.4.0

[2015/12/03 14:00:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: That would actually make sense. And be much easier to load in.

[2015/12/03 14:06:51] <brmbrmcar> How do you even use the csv stuff?
[2015/12/03 14:06:56] <Hume2> Tobbi: What should be scriptable on them? Only start and stop?
[2015/12/03 14:07:02] <brmbrmcar> Like, what is it for?
[2015/12/03 14:07:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: Colours, everything you can...
[2015/12/03 14:07:26] <Hume2> Disco snow!
[2015/12/03 14:07:59] <Tobbi> Yes, that too.
[2015/12/03 14:08:01] <Hume2> It's SuperTux, not DiscoTux :D But I can try.
[2015/12/03 14:12:24] <Tobbi> Hume2: Nah, it's good for post 0.4.0
[2015/12/03 14:12:36] <Tobbi> scripting whatever can be scripted
[2015/12/03 14:14:17] <Hume2> Well, after 0.4.0. There is more important stuff now.
[2015/12/03 14:14:41] <Tobbi> That's right.
[2015/12/03 14:14:47] <Tobbi> Hume2: But scripting is one of these important things.
[2015/12/03 14:15:29] <Hume2> I know, there are more important scripting stuff than disco weather.
[2015/12/03 14:15:49] <brmbrmcar> The invisible wall near the end of Down The Rabbit hole should be replaced.
[2015/12/03 14:16:03] <Tobbi> Hume2: Disco weather is actually rather important :D
[2015/12/03 14:16:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: No, it shouldn't.
[2015/12/03 14:16:19] <Tobbi> It makes for quite an interesting effect.
[2015/12/03 14:16:44] <brmbrmcar> Why not? It is stupid.

[2015/12/03 14:44:36] <brmbrmcar> I could try and add some levels, when it is in production.

[2015/12/03 14:45:29] <Hume2> If we don't accept a level, we must have a good reason.
[2015/12/03 14:46:37] <brmbrmcar> OK then.
[2015/12/03 14:46:56] <brmbrmcar> Should it be snow theme or forest?

[2015/12/03 14:48:50] <Hume2> :D Good note.
[2015/12/03 14:50:54] <Hume2> I'd suggest to make only one level a day, else it will look like TeraTux.
[2015/12/03 14:51:50] <Hume2> When I was working on TeraTux, I tried to make 6 levels a day.
[2015/12/03 14:51:50] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/12/03 14:51:51] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/03 14:51:56] <Tobbi> Why this OCD?
[2015/12/03 14:51:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/03 14:53:01] <brmbrmcar> I made a levelset like TeraTux, apart from it had a load of scripts.
[2015/12/03 14:54:13] <Hume2> How many levels made you a day when working on it?
[2015/12/03 14:55:42] <Hume2> Making more levels a day is really dangerous. The first time I made some decent levels, but after that it started to bore me.
[2015/12/03 14:56:03] <Tobbi> This will hopefully be improved with the new level editor.
[2015/12/03 14:56:40] <Hume2> ...so the levels were crappier and crappier. After that I was so bored, so I couldn't make any level, even a crappy one.
[2015/12/03 14:57:05] <Hume2> Tobbi. I have already seen some crappy levels made in the new editor.
[2015/12/03 14:58:02] <Tobbi> Hume2: I know...but it will get improved.

[2015/12/03 15:16:57] <Hume2> It's like that. When you have crappy levels, the enormous count of them won't save you.

[2015/12/03 17:23:09] <Tobbi> what?
[2015/12/03 17:27:22] <Tobbi> maths22: So, you're using WiX to create the installer. Does it support compression?
[2015/12/03 17:30:06] @ Quit: leyyin: Quit: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
[2015/12/03 17:50:20] <maths22> Tobbi: Sure.  I don't know that it will do very much, but I can see about turning it on
[2015/12/03 17:50:34] <maths22> (The installer is 3 mb bigger than the 0.3.5a one)
[2015/12/03 17:50:43] <Tobbi> maths22: If you can, LZMA2 compression...
[2015/12/03 18:04:57] <maths22> Tobbi: I can't choose the algorithm-sorry.  How much of a size change would that create?
[2015/12/03 18:05:09] <Tobbi> maths22: I am not sure. Could we use NSIS instead?
[2015/12/03 18:05:51] <maths22> Tobbi: I'll see.  Why?
[2015/12/03 18:06:01] <Tobbi> maths22: Because that allows you to set compression.
[2015/12/03 18:06:02] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/03 18:06:10] <Tobbi> LZMA2 as well, afiak.
[2015/12/03 18:07:40] <maths22> Running now-will compare output sizes
[2015/12/03 18:07:49] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2015/12/03 18:09:47] <Tobbi> It allows setting LZMA, not LZMA2...
[2015/12/03 18:09:49] <Tobbi> but still...
[2015/12/03 18:15:37] <maths22> With high compression set on WIX, it is a 2 mb difference
[2015/12/03 18:17:42] <maths22> Do you have any other reason to prefer one or the other?
[2015/12/03 18:18:09] <maths22> WIX has much better handling of upgrades
[2015/12/03 18:19:41] <Tobbi> maths22: No, it's fine.
[2015/12/03 18:19:44] <Tobbi> Just use WiX then.
[2015/12/03 18:20:30] <maths22> (More accurately, NSIS has no handling of upgrades)
[2015/12/03 18:21:52] <Tobbi> I guess since it's mostly binary files...
[2015/12/03 18:21:58] <Tobbi> it wouldn't compress well, anyway.
[2015/12/03 18:22:20] <maths22> Tobbi: Exactly
[2015/12/03 18:22:28] <maths22> This is why there is minimal change over time

[2015/12/03 20:33:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Check if it still starts slow...?
[2015/12/03 20:33:43] <Tobbi> I am trying to update langpacks at startup again.
[2015/12/03 20:33:54] <head8debian> Ah, will do.
[2015/12/03 20:34:04] <Tobbi> I think it might not be fixed...
[2015/12/03 20:34:08] <Tobbi> but who knows.
[2015/12/03 20:35:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Nope, no better.
[2015/12/03 20:35:48] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/12/03 20:35:54] <head8debian> Cannot you trigger it to check after its running?
[2015/12/03 20:36:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: My internet connection is too fast :P
[2015/12/03 20:36:13] <Tobbi> I got a 25 Mbit line.

[2015/12/03 20:36:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, it's fine. I tried simulating a slow line.
[2015/12/03 20:36:56] <Tobbi> works fine.
[2015/12/03 20:37:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, if you revert that commit, it works faster, right?
[2015/12/03 20:37:11] <head8debian> Odd.
[2015/12/03 20:37:16] <head8debian> How do i revert?
[2015/12/03 20:37:18] <head8debian> :)
[2015/12/03 20:37:25] <head8debian> Never had to do that before.

[2015/12/03 20:40:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: And supertux is not even using any bandwidth when im starting it.
[2015/12/03 20:40:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: That is odd.
[2015/12/03 20:40:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, it's not the actual download that is causing the problem?

[2015/12/03 20:41:24] <head8debian> Well, i cannot verify that, but i would see a spike if it was using it.
[2015/12/03 20:41:51] <Tobbi> head8debian: Try starting with --debug.
[2015/12/03 20:41:59] <Tobbi> Tell me whether there are any debug output messages.
[2015/12/03 20:43:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: Hmm, it did download it, must have been cached though or something.
[2015/12/03 20:43:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: It only downloads things when they're not present.
[2015/12/03 20:43:56] <head8debian> Im having trouble recording it...
[2015/12/03 20:45:43] <Tobbi> head8debian: I will save you some trouble. I will skip updating when source language is en.
[2015/12/03 20:46:13] <Tobbi> head8debian: Also, I will probably add a setting...
[2015/12/03 20:46:21] <Tobbi> actually...string freeze...
[2015/12/03 20:46:28] <Tobbi> who cares...
[2015/12/03 20:46:33] <Tobbi> people won't be complaining :D
[2015/12/03 20:46:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: The video is uploading. Notice that the audio starts much earlier. That is not normal, and when you first run after building it sits and appears to do nothing for quite a while.
[2015/12/03 20:46:42] <head8debian> :)
[2015/12/03 20:46:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Or I will leave the string in English?

[2015/12/03 20:51:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: It didn't record audio.

[2015/12/04 08:53:16] <jesusalva> Belive me, it's worse in Brazil. If you work late from 22:00 to 05:00, you must receive 50% bonus by extra time, 20% bonus by night time, the hours worked are different, each hour haves only 52 minutes...
[2015/12/04 08:53:51] <jesusalva> And you still need to calc how much he will gain by sundays, and besides, if the work is dangerous or may damage your health, you have extra bonuses.
[2015/12/04 08:54:32] <jesusalva> Which must be considered before calculating the extra time you worked at night. Not even to say about calcs of Brazilian taxes.

[2015/12/04 11:07:51] <brmbrmcar> I would not pay 200,000$ for a tractor I could not crash.

[2015/12/04 15:40:54] <Karkus> Hello, Hume2
[2015/12/04 15:41:02] <Hume2> Hello, Karkus.
[2015/12/04 15:41:45] <Hume2> I'm just wonder that some people don't know what objects we have in SuperTux.
[2015/12/04 15:42:31] <Hume2> Well, some people, but I mean some people among the developers.
[2015/12/04 15:42:58] <Hume2> Or am I a specialist for that?
[2015/12/04 15:44:30] <Karkus> A specialist at knowing what objects we have?
[2015/12/04 15:44:44] <Hume2> It looks like that.
[2015/12/04 15:45:19] <Hume2> It's really a strange feeling.
[2015/12/04 15:47:15] <Hume2> I know that Tobbi knows many things I don't know.
[2015/12/04 15:52:07] <Hume2> I'm tired, bye!

[2015/12/05 08:34:26] <mt> brmbrmcar: are you still in the internet middle-age where everyone uses silly file upload sites with loads of ads and user tracking? come on. there's pastebins where you can paste plain text stuff (that includes SuperTux levels, worldmaps and most other code) and there's rather serious and well-known image hosts (imgur)
[2015/12/05 08:52:59] <head8debian> Or just use the cloud account that comes with google or amazon.
[2015/12/05 08:55:02] <mt> that'd increse the NSA problem
[2015/12/05 09:07:38] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: I can confirm that level is pretty awful
[2015/12/05 09:46:04] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: Thank you.
[2015/12/05 09:46:24] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: It starts with a torrent of enemies!

[2015/12/05 09:57:15] <head8debian> mt: True, but its really no worse than using these oddball file upload sites which you have absolutely *no* clue of what they do with your data.
[2015/12/05 09:58:01] <head8debian> At least i know what google would do with my data.
[2015/12/05 10:03:00] <mt> well, I like to use https://github.com/sebsauvage/ZeroBin or https://github.com/sametmax/0bin pastebin sites
[2015/12/05 10:03:25] <mt> as the data is stored encrypted in the URL and never (not even in encrypted form) sent to the server
[2015/12/05 10:04:00] <mt> er, the data is well sent to the server
[2015/12/05 10:04:03] <mt> but always encrypted
[2015/12/05 10:04:09] <mt> the key is never sent to the server
[2015/12/05 10:05:11] <head8debian> mt: I use owncloud with my email provider.
[2015/12/05 10:05:23] <head8debian> Well, they use owncloud, so i do. ;)
[2015/12/05 10:05:48] <mt> owncloud doesn't encrypt, I'd only use it via HTTPS and only when hosted on servers I have access to
[2015/12/05 10:06:57] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: Can you finish it?
[2015/12/05 10:06:59] <head8debian> mt: It doesn't encrypt itself, but my email provider encrypts the conection.
[2015/12/05 10:07:11] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Finish what?
[2015/12/05 10:07:37] <head8debian> mt: And i find my email providers TOS decent.
[2015/12/05 10:08:00] <mt> head8debian: and yet I'd not actually trust any external email provider for not doing bullshit
[2015/12/05 10:08:45] <brmbrmcar> The level.
[2015/12/05 10:09:52] <head8debian> mt: True. But im not goign to host my own email.
[2015/12/05 10:09:56] <head8debian> mt: https://www.openmailbox.org/tos
[2015/12/05 10:10:21] <mt> I should switch my mail server to OpenSMTPd at some point
[2015/12/05 10:11:10] <head8debian> They even have a freenode channel.
[2015/12/05 10:11:15] <head8debian> Not a huge one though.
[2015/12/05 10:15:03] <head8debian> mt: But barely any data is private anymore. You would have to encrypt your data on a public hosted VPS for it to be private.
[2015/12/05 10:15:50] <head8debian> What the world is coming to....
[2015/12/05 10:17:28] <mt> choose a provider you trust, use rather safe virtualization (KVM)/get a dedi/host at home/host at a DC you trust and set up an AS yourself, make sure to defend yourself against silly encryption and surveillance laws, then you're fine
[2015/12/05 10:21:29] <head8debian> Yes...
[2015/12/05 10:21:45] <head8debian> THats why i don't take video/pictures of myself and post them all over the interwebs. :D
[2015/12/05 10:43:21] <brmbrmcar> Most pastebins are wayworse than file uploaders.
[2015/12/05 10:44:04] <brmbrmcar> Bigger sites are the worst, because they will modify your files.
[2015/12/05 10:47:59] <mt> encrypted pastebins don't work like that
[2015/12/05 10:48:30] <mt> since if you modify the content something will cryptographically break
[2015/12/05 10:48:33] <brmbrmcar> I use ubuntu pastebin.
[2015/12/05 10:48:51] <brmbrmcar> pastebin.com is adware.
[2015/12/05 10:49:02] <mt> >pastebin.com
[2015/12/05 10:49:41] <brmbrmcar> Yes...
[2015/12/05 10:49:48] <mt> I use gist.github.com (all pastes are git repos <3) or 0bin/zerobin instances (pastes are encrypted <3)
[2015/12/05 10:50:05] <brmbrmcar> I would never use imgur.
[2015/12/05 10:51:06] <mt> why not? seems like a sane solution for me (at least for anything that's not strictly private)
[2015/12/05 10:51:15] <head8debian> Me also.
[2015/12/05 10:52:00] <brmbrmcar> Imgur is full of annoying ads, and a massive company.
[2015/12/05 10:52:04] <brmbrmcar> Use cubeupload
[2015/12/05 10:52:42] <brmbrmcar> And it is almost impossible to link to the actual picture.
[2015/12/05 10:53:29] <mt> >annoying ads >not using adblocker/https://i.imgur.com/${imageid}.${fileextension}
[2015/12/05 10:55:13] <brmbrmcar> I use adblock.
[2015/12/05 10:55:31] <mt> there's also https://ptpb.pw/ (open source), https://uguu.se/ (for large files, also open source) and tons of http://pomf.se/ clones (open source)
[2015/12/05 10:55:52] <head8debian> I don't care about ads too much as long as they dont get in the way of actual use.
[2015/12/05 10:55:55] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/05 10:56:02] <head8debian> THey keep the website going.
[2015/12/05 10:56:16] <brmbrmcar> I will use uguu.se
[2015/12/05 10:56:31] <mt> ads collect your private data more than you'd think
[2015/12/05 10:56:43] <head8debian> And that they don't use flash ads and collect data...
[2015/12/05 10:56:46] <head8debian> Heh.
[2015/12/05 10:57:07] <brmbrmcar> https://a.uguu.se/drjbqw_foreststuff.stl
[2015/12/05 10:57:21] <brmbrmcar> Only 24 hours though...
[2015/12/05 11:00:00] <brmbrmcar> I once got Superfish.
[2015/12/05 11:00:08] <brmbrmcar> Worst ads ever.
[2015/12/05 11:01:21] <mt> (why do people use crapware-loaded Windows installs instead of reinstalling clean)
[2015/12/05 11:02:01] <brmbrmcar> I had Superfish on Chrome OS.
[2015/12/05 11:02:18] <brmbrmcar> I deleted it quickly.
[2015/12/05 11:03:54] <brmbrmcar> If it was Windows it would still be there...
[2015/12/05 11:12:55] <head8debian> mt: I feel the same way as you, but i don't want to buy a OEM copy of windows and a licence key on top of the cost of a new computer. At least i can delete the junk-ware, but it leaves crud on my system.
[2015/12/05 11:15:18] <mt> just need to get the ISO from MS and enter your license key to reinstall
[2015/12/05 11:15:57] <mt> OEM keys won't work without OEM ISOs, but anything that ships with OEM software nowadays stores the license key in the hardware (UEFI)
[2015/12/05 11:16:28] <head8debian> I didn't know that.
[2015/12/05 11:16:34] <mt> which means that you can reinstall from the MS ISO without having to enter any key
[2015/12/05 11:16:39] <head8debian> SO no more external product keys?
[2015/12/05 11:16:40] <head8debian> COol.
[2015/12/05 11:17:10] <head8debian> I havent touched anything new in a while.
[2015/12/05 11:17:33] <mt> Well, I guess it's stored in the UEFI as that's the only thing that can store custom data w/o having to add a new internal device ;)
[2015/12/05 11:21:12] <head8debian> TWrue.
[2015/12/05 11:21:14] <head8debian> True*
[2015/12/05 11:29:05] <brmbrmcar> You want Windows?
[2015/12/05 11:30:30] <brmbrmcar> I don't understand how you can criticise me for my lack of security when you guys run Windows.

[2015/12/05 12:15:12] <mt> you can also prevent a join!

[2015/12/05 12:16:46] <mt> a (insert the not +b but almost +b mode) could at least make him wonder what's happened :>
[2015/12/05 12:17:20] <Tobbi> mt: I don't want him to wonder. For all I know, him wondering leads to his annoying behaviour.

[2015/12/05 12:18:20] <mt> for me, annoying behavior can be a reason to justify a ban if it continues to be a problem after telling the user to stop
[2015/12/05 12:18:29] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/12/05 12:18:36] <Tobbi> It won't be long before he tries it again.
[2015/12/05 12:18:49] <Tobbi> I just don't have time or nerves to deal with people like him.

[2015/12/05 15:29:04] <head8debian> Good afternoon Tobbi.
[2015/12/05 15:29:37] <Tobbi> hello head8debian
[2015/12/05 15:29:45] <Tobbi> Did anything interesting happen while I was away?
[2015/12/05 15:30:13] <head8debian> Tobbi: Nope, except all my computers shut off randomly and my brother runs up to me telling me that the comptuer froze...
[2015/12/05 15:30:29] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay...
[2015/12/05 15:31:07] <head8debian> I think my brother hit the power switch.
[2015/12/05 15:31:15] <head8debian> With his toe.

[2015/12/05 18:21:43] <Tobbi> Good morning, Karkus.
[2015/12/05 18:37:53] @ tux|dude joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/05 18:53:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: Morning?
[2015/12/05 18:54:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: In some place in this world, it is morning.
[2015/12/05 18:54:22] <Tobbi> Always think about that.
[2015/12/05 18:54:52] <Karkus> But for me it isn't, and I don't think it is for you either
[2015/12/05 18:56:35] <Karkus> Interestingly, nowhere in the world is June a summer month.
[2015/12/05 19:09:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: According to SuperTux, it is officially Christmas time now
[2015/12/05 19:09:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: Indeed ;)
[2015/12/05 19:09:58] <Karkus> Is 6th of December an important date?
[2015/12/05 19:11:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: Saint Nicholas day?
[2015/12/05 19:11:36] <Tobbi> Whatever Nikolaustag is in English.
[2015/12/05 19:12:28] <Karkus> Seems to be so. I don't know much about these festivities.
[2015/12/05 19:12:51] <Karkus> Also, the main menu level is annoying me now. Tux walks into walls too many times
[2015/12/05 19:14:59] @ Quit: leyyin: Quit: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
[2015/12/05 19:25:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: Tux walks into walls?
[2015/12/05 19:26:02] <Tobbi> That shouldn't happen.
[2015/12/05 19:26:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: He bumps into them as he's jumping up the steps
[2015/12/05 19:26:28] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2015/12/05 19:26:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: But he still advances right?
[2015/12/05 19:26:43] <Karkus> Yeah
[2015/12/05 19:27:02] <Tobbi> Karkus: If it matters, change the lookahead stuff in that file which I can't remember the name of...
[2015/12/05 19:27:06] <Tobbi> And I'm too lazy to look it up.
[2015/12/05 19:27:46] <Karkus> Tobbi: I've looked at it before, let me see if I can find it
[2015/12/05 19:32:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: Also, when M2 is complete, will we have to change the executable name to supertux3?
[2015/12/05 19:32:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: Never thought about that before.
[2015/12/05 19:32:28] <Tobbi> We might need to.
[2015/12/05 19:32:29] <Karkus> (and everything else e.g ~/.supertux3)
[2015/12/05 19:32:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: But might be a lot of work.
[2015/12/05 19:32:39] <Karkus> could mess things up big time
[2015/12/05 19:32:55] <Tobbi> I intend to take a longer break after the release.
[2015/12/05 19:33:06] <Karkus> Okay :)
[2015/12/05 19:33:30] <Tobbi> I helped you guys with the release, it's fine. If you guys want to continue...well, you don't depend on me, you all have access rights etc.
[2015/12/05 19:33:48] <Karkus> We will, of course
[2015/12/05 19:34:45] <Tobbi> great. :-)
[2015/12/05 19:35:11] <Tobbi> My life is strange...
[2015/12/05 19:35:20] <Tobbi> but what's normal anyway.
[2015/12/05 19:35:25] <Karkus> And, of course, when you come back to check up on us, there will be 10 worlds and it will be M5
[2015/12/05 19:35:57] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/12/05 19:36:06] <Karkus> D:
[2015/12/05 19:36:42] <Karkus> I guess that'll mean you unsubscribe from all the github emails and the mailing list then?
[2015/12/05 19:37:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, that means I need to take a longer break to reflect on my life, my achievements and my abilities.
[2015/12/05 19:37:30] <Tobbi> It was quite overdue...
[2015/12/05 19:38:04] <Tobbi> *is

[2015/12/06 10:35:09] <Hume2> Hello, brmbrmcar.
[2015/12/06 10:41:55] <Tobbi> Good thinking.
[2015/12/06 10:42:01] <Tobbi> re issue #252

[2015/12/06 10:43:25] <Tobbi> Bulgarian is at 97%.
[2015/12/06 10:44:14] <Hume2> Is there a level that hasn't paralax background so far? (and isn't in addon)
[2015/12/06 10:44:35] <Hume2> (...and can have)

[2015/12/06 10:48:38] <Tobbi> hah, the christmas theme :D
[2015/12/06 10:48:46] <Hume2> :D I guess that all levels those had arctic.jpg have now paralaz background.
[2015/12/06 10:49:09] <Hume2> Wait, menu level doesn't have so far!

[2015/12/06 10:54:02] <mt> what does the earth bonus actually do?
[2015/12/06 10:55:23] <brmbrmcar> mt:give Tux a light.
[2015/12/06 10:55:27] <Hume2> Press ctrl+down to become invincible for a moment.
[2015/12/06 10:56:12] <Tobbi> Hume2: The christmas hat someone slides across tux's head sometimes...can you fix that? I am too lazy to do so :P
[2015/12/06 10:56:28] <Tobbi> Aka, it doesn't feel like it's in complete sync with Tux's hat.
[2015/12/06 10:57:02] <Hume2> Tobbi: I noticed that, but I think that it's intended.
[2015/12/06 10:57:06] <Tobbi> Hume2: I was the one doing this change.
[2015/12/06 10:57:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: Actually, keep it.
[2015/12/06 10:57:20] <Tobbi> If you think it's intended, others will think so as well :D
[2015/12/06 10:58:57] <Hume2> :D
[2015/12/06 11:03:05] <brmbrmcar> I never noticed the earth hat invincibility.
[2015/12/06 11:03:23] <brmbrmcar> Whenever in the game it is used, it should be explained.
[2015/12/06 11:05:19] <Hume2> It's not used anywhere so far.
[2015/12/06 11:05:57] <Hume2> There was an idea that there could be a shop somewhere.
[2015/12/06 11:06:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: LMH's island uses it.
[2015/12/06 11:06:28] <Hume2> Tobbi: I haven't noticed, let me check.

[2015/12/06 11:06:41] <Tobbi> Hume2: There's "The flower world" at leasrt.
[2015/12/06 11:07:22] <brmbrmcar> I think air flower should not be in the shop.
[2015/12/06 11:07:34] <brmbrmcar> It has several problems.
[2015/12/06 11:08:24] <brmbrmcar> My incredibly bad forest levelI recently made has it...
[2015/12/06 11:09:29] <Hume2> In my opinion, the air and earth flowers fit to the shop perfectly.

[2015/12/06 11:09:45] <giby> Hi
[2015/12/06 11:10:06] <Hume2> Hello, Giby.
[2015/12/06 11:10:09] <giby> Tobbi, are you the one adding people on Transfix?
[2015/12/06 11:10:15] <Tobbi> giby: Yup.
[2015/12/06 11:10:17] <giby> Hi Hume2 :)
[2015/12/06 11:10:28] <Tobbi> giby: I figured we need as many people as possible so shortly before the release.
[2015/12/06 11:10:44] <Tobbi> Sorry if I overstepped my duties.
[2015/12/06 11:10:45] <giby> Tobbi, Oh.... Noooooo....
[2015/12/06 11:10:54] <Tobbi> giby: So far it's been fine.
[2015/12/06 11:11:00] <Tobbi> giby: I checked translations randomly.
[2015/12/06 11:11:05] <Tobbi> With Google translat.
[2015/12/06 11:11:06] <Tobbi> e
[2015/12/06 11:11:33] <giby> You can add whoever... but first you should have ask them to introduce themselves...
[2015/12/06 11:11:42] <Karkus> maths22: On http://brlcad.org/~maths22/supertux-download.php, why are they called 0.3.5?
[2015/12/06 11:11:53] <brmbrmcar> 0.3.5-git
[2015/12/06 11:11:57] <giby> Just to avoid few issues
[2015/12/06 11:12:08] <brmbrmcar> It is the normal name for git stuff.
[2015/12/06 11:12:32] <Karkus> But aren't we working towards 0.4.0 at this point
[2015/12/06 11:12:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: "git describe" uses the latest git tag available.
[2015/12/06 11:12:46] <Tobbi> Which at this point is 0.3.5
[2015/12/06 11:12:53] <Karkus> Ah
[2015/12/06 11:13:14] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/06 11:13:24] <Tobbi> giby: Actually, I also checked whether they are part of a group for a different open source project...and add these more easily.
[2015/12/06 11:13:45] <Tobbi> Because if they also translate another open source project, we can assume others accept their contributions as well.
[2015/12/06 11:13:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: I haven
[2015/12/06 11:14:04] <Tobbi> 't changed strings on transifex in about a week
[2015/12/06 11:14:07] <Tobbi> Despite string freeze.
[2015/12/06 11:14:11] <Tobbi> Something is clearly wrong.
[2015/12/06 11:14:29] <Tobbi> Someone could assume I go by what I say now.
[2015/12/06 11:14:52] <Tobbi> So maybe we should change one more string to convince people I am completely unreliable.
[2015/12/06 11:14:53] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/06 11:15:22] <Hume2> Plus there are a few new strings in incubator. :P
[2015/12/06 11:15:36] <brmbrmcar> I have also noticed with the earth flower that both control and action keys work.
[2015/12/06 11:15:47] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yeah, but, no. Leave these...
[2015/12/06 11:15:50] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/06 11:16:01] <Hume2> ...untranslated?
[2015/12/06 11:16:03] <Karkus> :D I also noticed German and Czech are the two fully translated languages... I wonder wht
[2015/12/06 11:16:07] <Karkus> *why
[2015/12/06 11:16:16] <Tobbi> Karkus: Because I am the one translating those strings, and Hume is.
[2015/12/06 11:16:16] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/06 11:16:26] <Tobbi> So, naturally we make sure we get them updated asap.
[2015/12/06 11:16:33] <Hume2> Exactly. And because of Narre.
[2015/12/06 11:16:40] <Tobbi> giby: Let me ask how the stk guys handle transifex contributors.
[2015/12/06 11:16:41] <Karkus> I'm kidding :P
[2015/12/06 11:16:44] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/06 11:16:47] <Tobbi> Ah, I see.
[2015/12/06 11:16:56] <Karkus> Also, how updated are the nightly builds?
[2015/12/06 11:17:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: Would you know how stk handles transifex contributors? Do you ask people to introduce themselves?
[2015/12/06 11:18:30] <Tobbi> Karkus: windows builds are fairly recent (only 5 commits behind)
[2015/12/06 11:18:31] <leyyin> idk
[2015/12/06 11:18:39] <Tobbi> leyyin: who does?
[2015/12/06 11:18:46] <leyyin> yes, themselfs
[2015/12/06 11:19:00] <leyyin> if you want to be a contributor to a language we add you for that language
[2015/12/06 11:19:09] <leyyin> on transifex
[2015/12/06 11:19:09] * Tobbi checks mac builds.
[2015/12/06 11:19:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: Are they just updated whenever maths22 triggers a build?
[2015/12/06 11:19:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe automatically, more or less.
[2015/12/06 11:19:30] <Tobbi> Unless people add [ci skip]
[2015/12/06 11:20:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: Last 5 commits were [ci skip].
[2015/12/06 11:20:10] <Tobbi> So, the windows build is recent.
[2015/12/06 11:20:51] <Karkus> There's about twenty different links though, is it the top one?
[2015/12/06 11:21:22] <Karkus> (windows)
[2015/12/06 11:21:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes. The higher the number the more recent.
[2015/12/06 11:21:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: Right. I'm going to boot into windows to test it out
[2015/12/06 11:22:01] @ Quit: Karkus: Quit: Division By Zero
[2015/12/06 11:22:23] <brmbrmcar> Does it work with all Windows now?
[2015/12/06 11:22:35] <brmbrmcar> I want to run it off Wine.
[2015/12/06 11:22:50] <Tobbi> Latest build for mac is from 17 days ago.
[2015/12/06 11:23:00] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I doubt wine works. There's still this bug report.
[2015/12/06 11:23:07] <Hume2> If it didn't work on Windows 10, it wouldn't really mind me.
[2015/12/06 11:23:17] <Tobbi> Not again!
[2015/12/06 11:23:18] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/06 11:23:29] <brmbrmcar> It only works on Windows 10.
[2015/12/06 11:23:43] <Hume2> What went wrong???
[2015/12/06 11:24:10] <brmbrmcar> With what???
[2015/12/06 11:24:43] <Hume2> You know, the "works only on Windows 10" thing.
[2015/12/06 11:25:22] <brmbrmcar> Well, I have noidea.
[2015/12/06 11:25:30] <brmbrmcar> I didn't build it.
[2015/12/06 11:25:54] <Tobbi> giby: When do you update the translations from transifex?
[2015/12/06 11:26:07] <Hume2> At least there's a chance that Microsoft will get rid of spying you when you play SuperTux.
[2015/12/06 11:26:08] <Tobbi> I'm not pushing just asking. :)
[2015/12/06 11:26:41] <brmbrmcar> I was forced to use Windows 10 on  Friday.
[2015/12/06 11:27:14] <Hume2> Who has forced you?
[2015/12/06 11:27:37] <brmbrmcar> My parents.
[2015/12/06 11:27:55] <Hume2> That's not good.
[2015/12/06 11:27:57] <brmbrmcar> They wanted to see whether video editing was any faster.
[2015/12/06 11:28:15] <brmbrmcar> Onstupid software they actually paid for.
[2015/12/06 11:28:33] <Hume2> :D And was it faster? Guess no.
[2015/12/06 11:29:14] <Hume2> Maybe it was faster, but only until Windows will mess up the registry.
[2015/12/06 11:29:16] <brmbrmcar> Well, itwas a computer upgrade...
[2015/12/06 11:29:18] <giby> Hume2, I don't care about MS spying on me... I'm under watch by intelligence service, that is worse
[2015/12/06 11:29:47] <Hume2> Giby, at least they are not interrested of your personal data.
[2015/12/06 11:30:07] <Tobbi> giby: Why are you?
[2015/12/06 11:30:10] <giby> they got them
[2015/12/06 11:30:39] <giby> I live in a socialist dictature.... You know, France....
[2015/12/06 11:30:51] <Tobbi> right.
[2015/12/06 11:30:54] <Tobbi> Okay, right.
[2015/12/06 11:31:33] <Hume2> I mean they aren't interrested in your PIN of your credit card.
[2015/12/06 11:31:34] <giby> even If I haven't ran for election this year, they still watch me
[2015/12/06 11:31:56] <giby> Hume2, they get better ways to get my money

[2015/12/06 11:49:27] <mt> and, the bigger problem, cmake
[2015/12/06 11:50:07] <mt> since we broke compatibility with cmake 2.x for some reason
[2015/12/06 11:50:23] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/12/06 11:50:26] <mt> and that's what precise and trusty ship
[2015/12/06 11:50:42] <Tobbi> Let's hold off on docker based infrastructure for now.
[2015/12/06 11:50:54] <Tobbi> this is an absolute nightmare in so many ways.
[2015/12/06 11:51:06] <brmbrmcar> Does cmake 2.x get past the finding stuff stage?
[2015/12/06 11:51:35] <mt> I don't think so; and there's a reason behind dropping 2.x support
[2015/12/06 11:53:27] <brmbrmcar> SoI have cmake 3?
[2015/12/06 11:55:08] <mt> if you're trying to build and it works, yep
[2015/12/06 11:55:36] <mt> we're talking about building right now, not about the nightlies, if you haven't realized
[2015/12/06 11:55:43] <brmbrmcar> Ihave an error with the gkew stuff.
[2015/12/06 11:56:13] <mt> 'sorry my system doesn't boot up anymore can you fix it plz?'
[2015/12/06 11:56:26] <mt> no exact error description => no help
[2015/12/06 11:57:14] <brmbrmcar> I deleted it.
[2015/12/06 11:57:33] <brmbrmcar> even setting depth to 1 turns intomassive space.
[2015/12/06 11:58:10] <Tobbi> I'd really like to know why glbinding won't build.

[2015/12/06 12:20:35] <Karkus> maths22: Okay, great
[2015/12/06 12:20:36] <maths22> Karkus: Numbering is now based on 'git describe', hence the 0.3.5
[2015/12/06 12:22:08] @ Hume2 left channel #supertux ()
[2015/12/06 12:22:39] <mt> for further: explanation git describe refers to v0.3.5 and not v0.3.5a because the latter is tagged in release/0.3.5, but not in master
[2015/12/06 12:22:51] <Tobbi> hah, nice.
[2015/12/06 12:23:14] <Tobbi> We should change that as well...

[2015/12/06 12:27:22] <Tobbi> It fails because of unshallow.

[2015/12/06 12:30:19] <Tobbi> maths22: But the code seems fine now. :-)
[2015/12/06 12:30:33] <Tobbi> I mean: It finds glbinding and builds with it.
[2015/12/06 12:30:35] <Tobbi> afaics.
[2015/12/06 12:30:47] <maths22> Tobbi: That is good
[2015/12/06 12:30:52] <mt> I wonder if we can somehow link the CI checks to the OBS nightlies instead of relying on our broken Travis setup

[2015/12/06 12:31:35] <mt> well currently we build cmake, sdl2 and sdl2-image on travis manually

[2015/12/06 12:31:59] <maths22> Also, only the OS X nightlies use travis
[2015/12/06 12:32:02] <mt> upgrading to travis' trusty will still need cmake builds since trusty is still using cmake 2.x

[2015/12/06 12:33:10] <mt> yeah, there's dist: trusty
[2015/12/06 12:33:14] <mt> which provides sdl2
[2015/12/06 12:33:22] <mt> but not cmake 3

[2015/12/06 12:33:33] <Tobbi> I see!
[2015/12/06 12:34:07] <Tobbi> mt: So, if that's migrated, we can switch to docker builds?
[2015/12/06 12:34:11] <Tobbi> *once
[2015/12/06 12:34:13] <mt> no
[2015/12/06 12:34:26] <Tobbi> Hrm, okay.
[2015/12/06 12:34:27] <mt> dist: trusty is Google Cloud Engine w/o docker only
[2015/12/06 12:34:55] <Tobbi> Guys, do we switch over to using glbinding instead of glew? According to them, they have a better CXX11 API...
[2015/12/06 12:35:44] <mt> what about glbinding availabilty in popular distros?
[2015/12/06 12:36:24] <mt> if it's not available everywhere we should announce the switch one 0.y.0 before the actual release, imho
[2015/12/06 12:37:40] <maths22> mt: It actually uses https://launchpad.net/~george-edison55/+archive/ubuntu/cmake-3.x for cmake
[2015/12/06 12:38:05] <mt> glbinding is not in debian sid, ubuntu xenial, arch, gentoo
[2015/12/06 12:38:17] <mt> haven't checked rpm-based distros
[2015/12/06 12:38:31] <mt> maths22: ah, then at least dist: trusty will work
[2015/12/06 12:38:56] <mt> there's sadly no cmake 3.x ppa allowed for docker-based builds
[2015/12/06 12:39:10] <maths22> mt: What are these docker-based builds of which we week?
[2015/12/06 12:39:14] <maths22> s/week/speak/
[2015/12/06 12:39:14] <red_bot> maths22 meant: "mt: What are these docker-based builds of which we speak?"
[2015/12/06 12:39:32] <mt> Travis' docker build infrastructure
[2015/12/06 12:39:39] <Tobbi> mt: Okay, but at least having the ability to use glbinding is good.
[2015/12/06 12:40:46] <maths22> mt: That is correct.  trusty currently doesn't support the docker-based builds
[2015/12/06 12:41:03] <Tobbi> maths22: I wonder: Why did the build just fail now because of --unshallow? It worked the days before today...
[2015/12/06 12:41:12] <Tobbi> Did anything change?
[2015/12/06 12:41:43] <maths22> However, it has an 'apt' plugin that installs apt packges from a list of approved repositories without using sudo
[2015/12/06 12:42:10] <mt> I know, but there's no obvious repo name that suggests there are cmake 3.x packages available
[2015/12/06 12:42:10] <maths22> mt: see https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/travis/.travis.yml
[2015/12/06 12:42:28] <maths22> mt: and see https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-cookbooks/blob/master/cookbooks/travis_cmake/recipes/default.rb
[2015/12/06 12:43:31] <mt> btw, I had https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/feature/travis-ci-docker-builds/.travis.yml
[2015/12/06 12:44:04] <mt> but yeah, it failed because cmake isn't available and I also didn't want to mix in debian-sid for sdl2
[2015/12/06 12:44:08] <maths22> mt: OK.  That makes sense
[2015/12/06 12:44:35] <maths22> Mine does most of the same things
[2015/12/06 12:44:44] <mt> main problem: it preferred to download everything from debian sid but that wasn't cached on travis infrastructure
[2015/12/06 12:45:07] <mt> while the precise packages, are iirc, cached
[2015/12/06 12:45:20] <mt> feel free to delete the branch
[2015/12/06 12:46:22] <mt> Tobbi: maybe we should switch the default to glbinding and for the 0.4.0 release put up a big bold text telling package managers to consider to switch to glbinding?
[2015/12/06 12:46:54] <Tobbi> mt: We could certainly do that...
[2015/12/06 12:47:02] <Tobbi> But I still expect an uproar by them.
[2015/12/06 12:47:09] <Tobbi> GLEW is what they're used to.
[2015/12/06 12:47:55] <mt> packaging glbinding shouldn't be a big problem, and toggling a cmake switch to use GLEW should be even less of a problem
[2015/12/06 12:48:16] <mt> and that way they'll have time before we drop GLEW support
[2015/12/06 12:48:22] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/12/06 12:48:26] <Tobbi> Do we even want to drop it?
[2015/12/06 12:48:32] <Tobbi> I say we keep it.
[2015/12/06 12:49:11] <Tobbi> maths22: Why did the build we did half an hour ago fail due to --unshallow? I can remember --unshallow working before that...I still don't understand that issue.
[2015/12/06 12:50:09] <Tobbi> I might be stupid :D
[2015/12/06 12:51:25] <maths22> I don't know why... taking a look now
[2015/12/06 12:51:42] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/12/06 12:53:04] <maths22> Tobbi: I still have no idea
[2015/12/06 12:53:09] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/12/06 12:53:23] <Tobbi> This is totally weird...
[2015/12/06 12:54:17] <maths22> Tobbi: I assumed it must be an old git version, but if it used to work, it should still work (unless something went wrong on the travis end)
[2015/12/06 12:54:27] <Tobbi> I might ask in #travis
[2015/12/06 12:55:06] <Tobbi> maths22: When did you add --unshallow? Not too long ago, right?
[2015/12/06 12:55:56] <maths22> Tobbi: december 1
[2015/12/06 12:56:13] <Tobbi> We had successful builds since then, iirc.
[2015/12/06 12:56:34] <maths22> Tobbi: that is correct
[2015/12/06 12:58:27] <maths22> mt: Once I have OS X and windows happy, I'll fix up the OBS builds for linux
[2015/12/06 12:58:37] <Tobbi> maths22: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/4942
[2015/12/06 12:58:43] <Tobbi> Maybe we should just make another commit.
[2015/12/06 13:00:49] <Tobbi> I will add that option they talk about.
[2015/12/06 13:01:12] <maths22> Tobbi: see
[2015/12/06 13:01:13] <maths22> This seems to be happening reliably on the migrated new-infra precise workers
[2015/12/06 13:01:21] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/12/06 13:01:29] <maths22> Tobbi: Don't worry about that, since we are switching to trusty tonight
[2015/12/06 13:01:39] <Tobbi> okay, then, let's wait.
[2015/12/06 13:01:57] <maths22> Tobbi: I just need to finish up fixing silly OS X errors, and then I will merge
[2015/12/06 13:02:04] <Tobbi> alright!
[2015/12/06 13:02:21] <Tobbi> I just hope that glbinding building is fixed for good.
[2015/12/06 13:03:01] <maths22> Tobbi: hopefully...

[2015/12/07 08:50:37] <Tobbi> maths22: It seems like you're the one in the team doing most of the work. I'm quite sorry for that.
[2015/12/07 08:50:43] <Tobbi> You never seem to get any break.
[2015/12/07 08:50:58] <maths22> Tobbi: I'm enjoying it, or I wouldn't be doing it
[2015/12/07 08:51:09] <Tobbi> That's good :)

[2015/12/07 11:07:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: It doesn't fit for a C64.
[2015/12/07 11:07:20] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: What broke on your ubuntu install>
[2015/12/07 11:07:21] <head8debian> ?
[2015/12/07 11:07:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: What?
[2015/12/07 11:07:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: A C64 is an old computer.
[2015/12/07 11:07:40] <maths22> Tobbi: OK.  I'll look into it later
[2015/12/07 11:08:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ah, the comadore. :D
[2015/12/07 11:08:18] <head8debian> Tobbi: My PC is not that old.
[2015/12/07 11:08:22] <Tobbi> head8debian: Exactly. Also, it's Commodore. You don't get comatose.
[2015/12/07 11:08:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its only 5 years old.
[2015/12/07 11:08:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: Still older than brmbrmcar.
[2015/12/07 11:08:49] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: One of my configuration files.
[2015/12/07 11:09:15] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Ah.
[2015/12/07 11:09:24] <brmbrmcar> It deleted the taskbar and thing at top.
[2015/12/07 11:09:29] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Thought you broke Xorg or something. :D
[2015/12/07 11:09:30] <maths22> Tobbi: I'm thinking about getting the domain supertuxproject.org so we can have things hosted propertly (for these builds and such)
[2015/12/07 11:09:31] <head8debian> Heh.
[2015/12/07 11:09:37] <maths22> How does that sound?
[2015/12/07 11:09:43] <Tobbi> maths22: That would be great!
[2015/12/07 11:09:46] <head8debian> maths22: If you want to pay for it, sure.
[2015/12/07 11:09:59] <maths22> (Sadly supertux.org is taken and for sale for some ridiculous amount of money)
[2015/12/07 11:10:04] <head8debian> We don't have a full-fledged server ATM.
[2015/12/07 11:10:07] <brmbrmcar> I had to reinstall twice, as first time I copied over the bad file.
[2015/12/07 11:10:10] <maths22> head8debian: It's like 10 dollars for a year
[2015/12/07 11:10:26] <head8debian> maths22: What does it have for resources?
[2015/12/07 11:10:30] <maths22> I can do that.  (And I have a server to point to as necessary)
[2015/12/07 11:10:49] <Tobbi> Some German guy hosted it.
[2015/12/07 11:10:57] <maths22> head8debian: the 10 dollars is for the domain
[2015/12/07 11:11:07] <head8debian> Ah, i see.
[2015/12/07 11:11:27] <head8debian> I thought you wanted to buy a server and a domain. :)
[2015/12/07 11:11:28] <maths22> The server is run by the BRL-CAD organization (more or less) for open source projects to use
[2015/12/07 11:11:32] <head8debian> Anyways, cool.
[2015/12/07 11:11:33] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/12/07 11:11:45] <Tobbi> yay, anyone have 395 USD ready?
[2015/12/07 11:11:50] <Tobbi> Now we could use donations.
[2015/12/07 11:11:52] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/07 11:11:55] <head8debian> :D
[2015/12/07 11:12:14] <maths22> Tobbi: That's what I was thinking :)  supertuxproject is so much cheaper
[2015/12/07 11:12:16] <leyyin> run with the money :P
[2015/12/07 11:12:33] <Tobbi> leyyin: Eventually I intend to just keep the money all by myself, you know me.
[2015/12/07 11:12:35] <head8debian> supertux.org would be so cool though. :)
[2015/12/07 11:12:52] <head8debian> Oh well.
[2015/12/07 11:13:11] <Tobbi> leyyin: And afterwards, I will say something along the lines "No one has an intention of keeping donations"
[2015/12/07 11:13:34] <maths22> head8debian: I know.  And it is just owned by some domain squatter
[2015/12/07 11:13:54] <maths22> At least supertux.com/supertux.net are owned by some guy in California, who seems to basically own them for his own purposes
[2015/12/07 11:14:03] <head8debian> maths22: I hate those. They steal alot of good domains.
[2015/12/07 11:14:04] <maths22> (And has had at least supertux.com since 2000!)
[2015/12/07 11:14:20] <Tobbi> supertux.com is great. Just "test"
[2015/12/07 11:14:32] <head8debian> maths22: Wow, thats a long time.
[2015/12/07 11:14:45] <maths22> Tobbi: I know!
[2015/12/07 11:15:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: They do it because they might think we will eventually agree to their high demands.
[2015/12/07 11:15:04] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/07 11:15:16] <Tobbi> With all that money we make from SuperTux.
[2015/12/07 11:15:17] <Tobbi> You know :D
[2015/12/07 11:15:48] <head8debian> Yeah. :D
[2015/12/07 11:16:27] <brmbrmcar> How much money does Supertux actually make?
[2015/12/07 11:16:59] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: In case you didn't notice...That was sarcasm.
[2015/12/07 11:17:22] <brmbrmcar> Nothing?
[2015/12/07 11:18:19] <brmbrmcar> Any donations at all?
[2015/12/07 11:18:21] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How would we potentially earn money? Ingame ads?
[2015/12/07 11:18:22] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/07 11:18:32] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Do you see a donation button on the website or in the game?
[2015/12/07 11:18:52] <brmbrmcar> It says about wanting to pay for SuperTux.
[2015/12/07 11:20:04] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: where does it say so?
[2015/12/07 11:21:27] <brmbrmcar> In the wiki below some pages. I'll send you a link...
[2015/12/07 11:21:38] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: We are a open source game, we don't require money donations. The only reason we would ever need money is to pay to host a server.
[2015/12/07 11:21:51] <head8debian> He must has missread.

[2015/12/07 11:23:31] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: If you want to pay for SuperTux, you can make a donation, which would be highly appreciated, but we're not making you pay.

[2015/12/07 11:24:06] <brmbrmcar> supertuxkart do it.
[2015/12/07 11:24:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: SuperTux is more popular than you'd think.
[2015/12/07 11:24:28] <head8debian> maths22: We could pay for a domain if we did this. :)
[2015/12/07 11:24:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: My thinking exactly.
[2015/12/07 11:25:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: And you could buy a goat with it. :p
[2015/12/07 11:25:30] <Tobbi> head8debian: And let it live in my garden.
[2015/12/07 11:25:35] <Tobbi> My neighbours will be pleased.
[2015/12/07 11:25:43] <brmbrmcar> You just called a goat it!
[2015/12/07 11:26:01] <Tobbi> i didn't even get that bad pun.
[2015/12/07 11:26:26] <brmbrmcar> Give a gift levelset out!
[2015/12/07 11:26:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: I have a goat you can have, you jsut have to come get it. ;D
[2015/12/07 11:26:58] <head8debian> She will make a perfect friend.
[2015/12/07 11:26:58] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/07 11:27:12] <Tobbi> I'd rather not.
[2015/12/07 11:27:16] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/12/07 11:27:42] <brmbrmcar> I'd like a goat, but the dog might fight the goat.
[2015/12/07 11:27:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: Although it might remind my neighbours that it can always get worse.
[2015/12/07 11:27:58] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/12/07 11:28:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: You know, I left my xmas lights out the whole year just to annoy them. A goat in the garden might be a new low.
[2015/12/07 11:29:33] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do we need a proper bank account if we were to accept donations?
[2015/12/07 11:34:31] <brmbrmcar> You need one with 800% intrest. :D

[2015/12/07 11:46:25] <Tobbi> Pretending to kick someone is much better than actually doing it.
[2015/12/07 11:46:30] <Tobbi> Wears itself off after a while.

[2015/12/07 11:48:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Email addresses for what?
[2015/12/07 11:48:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: I just meant something like Karkus@supertuxproject.org
[2015/12/07 11:48:29] <brmbrmcar> Supertux 0.0.4 started ithout the right dependencies.
[2015/12/07 11:48:34] <Tobbi> Now that this domain was bought.. :P
[2015/12/07 11:49:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, who bought it?
[2015/12/07 11:49:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: maths22 did.
[2015/12/07 11:49:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: We are looking into accepting donations so that we can eventually buy supertux.org
[2015/12/07 11:49:25] <brmbrmcar> How many email adresses are allowed on there?
[2015/12/07 11:49:29] <Karkus> maths22: Wow, that's great!
[2015/12/07 11:49:38] <head8debian> maths22: "D
[2015/12/07 11:49:41] <head8debian> :*
[2015/12/07 11:50:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Sounds good. We would need to partner with something like SPI or Copyleft Games etc. to manage donations though, I reckon
[2015/12/07 11:50:34] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Its infinite.
[2015/12/07 11:50:43] <Tobbi> Ah...What I was thinking.
[2015/12/07 11:50:48] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2015/12/07 11:51:09] <brmbrmcar> But they steal some of the money!
[2015/12/07 11:51:30] <Karkus> Inevitably
[2015/12/07 11:52:25] <brmbrmcar> We do not want that.
[2015/12/07 11:52:29] <Karkus> As in it is inevitable we would have to partner
[2015/12/07 11:52:36] <brmbrmcar> Jus use a bank account
[2015/12/07 11:53:02] <maths22> brmbrmcar: SOme legal organization needs to own the bank account
[2015/12/07 11:53:10] <maths22> We don't want it to be in one of our names personally
[2015/12/07 11:53:17] <Tobbi> All transaction costs (such as the 4.5% for credit cards, and wire transfer fees) are deducted from the contribution.  5% of the remainder is deducted for SPI overhead, primarily accounting, photocopying and postage.  The remaining money is held in trust for the project.
[2015/12/07 11:53:22] <Karkus> maths22: Precisely
[2015/12/07 11:53:27] <head8debian> Tobbi: Open a paypal account with the supertux openmailbox email address.
[2015/12/07 11:53:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about the fees?
[2015/12/07 11:53:45] <head8debian> Paypal doesn't have fees.
[2015/12/07 11:53:49] <Tobbi> Oh, right.
[2015/12/07 11:53:55] <head8debian> Or ive never known them to.
[2015/12/07 11:54:02] <head8debian> If they did we would be in trouble.
[2015/12/07 11:54:07] <maths22> I will get email set up at some point
[2015/12/07 11:54:16] <maths22> New download URL http://download.supertuxproject.org/download/
[2015/12/07 11:54:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: If we make substantial amounts of money, we should do public statements how much money we have.
[2015/12/07 11:54:23] <Tobbi> Or maybe even otherwise.
[2015/12/07 11:54:29] <Tobbi> It might encourage trust in the project.
[2015/12/07 11:54:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Eh.
[2015/12/07 11:54:34] <head8debian> True.
[2015/12/07 11:54:51] <Tobbi> head8debian: But don't tell them about that secret limousine I intend to buy with the first 1 million.
[2015/12/07 11:54:56] <maths22> (I need to update appveyor to pull from the new site-next build will otherwise fail)

[2015/12/07 11:56:19] <Tobbi> I don't know. I guess someone else could govern the paypal account as well.

[2015/12/07 11:59:51] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/12/07 12:00:00] <Tobbi> It's just that .org is used by many open source projects.
[2015/12/07 12:00:00] <maths22> mt: In general, at this point in time, .org/.com/.net are more trusted by the general public
[2015/12/07 12:00:23] <brmbrmcar> Use something rare.

[2015/12/07 12:54:01] <maths22> Does that sound reasonable?
[2015/12/07 12:57:12] <brmbrmcar> I haven't a clue.
[2015/12/07 12:58:48] <maths22> Not now, but later I'll work out Windows 64 bit installs
[2015/12/07 12:59:39] <brmbrmcar> Any progress with the Windows builds?
[2015/12/07 13:04:21] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Yes and no (yes on my machine; not yet in a way I am satisfied with for appveyor)
[2015/12/07 13:05:10] <brmbrmcar> So does Wine work?
[2015/12/07 13:05:22] <maths22> I know what I need to do; I just haven't decided how to do it
[2015/12/07 13:05:27] <maths22> Regarding Wine, I have no idea
[2015/12/07 13:05:28] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/07 13:05:47] <maths22> Once it works on Windows 10 and 7, I may test it on Wine
[2015/12/07 13:06:00] <brmbrmcar> Thanks.
[2015/12/07 13:09:42] <Tobbi> We should really find a way to download l10n packages automatically...
[2015/12/07 13:10:09] <Tobbi> Otherwise, people have no idea that they have to download it.
[2015/12/07 13:10:53] <Tobbi> But if I do that, head8debian will complain.
[2015/12/07 13:10:55] <Tobbi> Because slow internet.
[2015/12/07 13:12:15] <maths22> Tobbi: we would check the system language and offer to download if it is not already installed (we might need to bundle a list of supported languages with the application)
[2015/12/07 13:12:53] <Tobbi> maths22: We could actually do that...
[2015/12/07 13:14:51] <brmbrmcar> What are l10 packages?

[2015/12/07 14:08:33] <mt> releases will be made as needed, following the semver spec
[2015/12/07 14:09:59] <brmbrmcar> 0.4.3 is neccesary.
[2015/12/07 14:10:07] <mt> tag & build 0.4.0+42.git yourself
[2015/12/07 14:10:15] <mt> if it makes you happy
[2015/12/07 14:10:20] <brmbrmcar> I can't.
[2015/12/07 14:10:25] <mt> why is it necessary?
[2015/12/07 14:10:57] <brmbrmcar> To finish off the stable releases, like 0.1.x.
[2015/12/07 14:11:13] <brmbrmcar> Then 0.5.x can move onto more advanterous stuff.
[2015/12/07 14:11:44] <mt> I mean, everyone in the releng team would be happy if we didn't have so many bugs in 0.4.0 so we'd have to release 3 bugfix releases
[2015/12/07 14:12:06] <mt> why can't we finish off 0.4.z with 0.4.0 or 0.4.1?
[2015/12/07 14:12:20] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 272 seconds
[2015/12/07 14:12:48] <brmbrmcar> 0.4.1 is guaranteed. 0.4.2 is good for cfinishig off stuff ,ike vthe forest world.
[2015/12/07 14:13:15] <maths22> brmbrmcar: A final release with the forest world integrated into the main game would definitely warrant releasing as 0.5.0
[2015/12/07 14:13:17] <mt> finishing off stuff, like forest world -> 0.5z
[2015/12/07 14:13:28] <mt> s/5z/5\.z/
[2015/12/07 14:13:28] <red_bot> mt meant: "finishing off stuff, like forest world -> 0.5\.z"
[2015/12/07 14:13:45] <maths22> mt: Apparently you don't need to escape your dots
[2015/12/07 14:13:49] <maths22> :)
[2015/12/07 14:14:17] <brmbrmcar> Nope.
[2015/12/07 14:14:24] <mt> because that is, as defined by semver a "MINOR version [should be incremented] when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner"
[2015/12/07 14:14:26] <brmbrmcar> It was planned for 0.4.0
[2015/12/07 14:14:37] <mt> then it will be moved to 0.5.z
[2015/12/07 14:14:44] <mt> heck is that so hard to understand?
[2015/12/07 14:14:48] <brmbrmcar> It should be continued.
[2015/12/07 14:15:05] <brmbrmcar> 0.5.x for a tiny change?
[2015/12/07 14:15:21] <maths22> brmbrmcar: How is adding a whole world into the main game "tiny"?
[2015/12/07 14:15:26] <mt> making the forest world fully complete will be a rather big thin-
[2015/12/07 14:15:57] <brmbrmcar> Not really.
[2015/12/07 14:16:06] <brmbrmcar> Just a few more levels.
[2015/12/07 14:16:48] <mt> it will also include a forest boss, possibly continuing in Story Mode directly to Forest World when finished with Icy Island, ... (add your ideas here)
[2015/12/07 14:17:27] <mt> and hey, what's your problem if we end up with 0.128.0?
[2015/12/07 14:17:44] <maths22> Tobbi: Do you know why Clang has trouble building GLBinding?
[2015/12/07 14:17:53] <Tobbi> maths22: Still? I thought I fixed it.
[2015/12/07 14:17:59] <brmbrmcar> Fprest boss is already made.
[2015/12/07 14:18:31] <maths22> mt: At what point would we be ready for 1.0.0?
[2015/12/07 14:18:35] <mt> a real story for the forest boss still has to be created
[2015/12/07 14:18:46] <mt> maths22: dunno, if our API is stable
[2015/12/07 14:18:53] <maths22> Tobbi: Nope-see https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux/jobs/95407867
[2015/12/07 14:18:54] <brmbrmcar> Forest boss is done!
[2015/12/07 14:19:03] <brmbrmcar> Don't you realise?
[2015/12/07 14:19:06] <maths22> mt: That is a meaningless concept for SuperTux-it doesn't have an API
[2015/12/07 14:19:07] <brmbrmcar> Tree suck
[2015/12/07 14:19:09] <mt> maths22: I think in a game, that'd refer to stable level and scripting API I guess
[2015/12/07 14:19:11] <Tobbi> damn this.
[2015/12/07 14:19:42] <maths22> mt: That seems reasonable.
[2015/12/07 14:19:56] <Tobbi> But, great, the error is different!!!
[2015/12/07 14:19:57] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/12/07 14:20:36] <mt> brmbrmcar: I think treeboss will still need some changes, which clearly won't be defined as bugfixes.
[2015/12/07 14:20:46] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/12/07 14:21:04] <mt> and 0.4.z would be a bug fix. end of the story.
[2015/12/07 14:21:19] <brmbrmcar> The lantern should be sucked anywhere around the mouth.
[2015/12/07 14:21:36] <brmbrmcar> 0.4.x is Milestone 2 stable! Linke 0.1.x!
[2015/12/07 14:21:45] <mt> then open an issue for this, it's probably not something that's gonna get fixed for 0.4.z
[2015/12/07 14:22:06] <mt> yeah, stable as-is right now.
[2015/12/07 14:22:24] <mt> but we'll probably drop the idea of Milestone x anyway
[2015/12/07 14:22:34] <brmbrmcar> There are things planned for 0.4.x
[2015/12/07 14:22:37] <Tobbi> maths22: https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux/jobs/95407867#L5694
[2015/12/07 14:22:43] <Tobbi> It had trouble building glbinding.
[2015/12/07 14:22:54] <maths22> mt: I believe it could also be a non-breaking minor improvement
[2015/12/07 14:22:59] <maths22> And still be 0.4.x
[2015/12/07 14:23:03] <mt> brmbrmcar: then we'll move them to plans for 0.5.z; real end of story now
[2015/12/07 14:23:15] <maths22> Tobbi: I was asking if you knew why that happened?
[2015/12/07 14:23:32] <brmbrmcar> *sigh*
[2015/12/07 14:23:32] <Tobbi> maths22: I believe the issue is that the glbinding source code isn't compatible with clang :D
[2015/12/07 14:23:35] <Tobbi> Sorry.
[2015/12/07 14:23:43] <mt> the thing is, we ended up in a mess when we were doing 0.3.x(letter)
[2015/12/07 14:23:57] <mt> and package managers complained
[2015/12/07 14:24:01] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/12/07 14:24:01] <maths22> Tobbi: lovely
[2015/12/07 14:24:11] <maths22> mt: Letters defintely are not helpful for that
[2015/12/07 14:24:13] <Tobbi> maths22: Indeed. It might be fixed with latest master. One needs to check.
[2015/12/07 14:24:25] <brmbrmcar> Yeah, but it is a bad idea to change the planned versioning scheme for the near future.
[2015/12/07 14:24:31] <Tobbi> We should've used underscores.
[2015/12/07 14:24:36] <Tobbi> 0.3.5_1
[2015/12/07 14:25:08] <mt> nah, we should've used something even more ridiculous, like backslashes or the & sign
[2015/12/07 14:25:13] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/07 14:25:15] <mt> 0.3.5\1 or 0.3.5&1
[2015/12/07 14:25:25] <maths22> Tobbi: A fourth decimal would have worked
[2015/12/07 14:25:25] <leper`> just use one more .
[2015/12/07 14:25:30] <maths22> leper`: Exactly
[2015/12/07 14:25:41] <mt> that looked ugly
[2015/12/07 14:25:42] <Tobbi> mt: we have a lot of encodings at our disposal.
[2015/12/07 14:25:44] <Tobbi> bbl
[2015/12/07 14:25:46] <brmbrmcar> The dreaded 0.3.6
[2015/12/07 14:25:53] <mt> so we decided to do 0.3.5a
[2015/12/07 14:26:02] <leper`> _-~ are all used by some packaging schemes to indicate some packaging changes
[2015/12/07 14:26:18] <leper`> (not too sure about _ but I think I saw that somewhere)
[2015/12/07 14:26:43] <brmbrmcar> You should have done 0.3.6, just to keep people happy.
[2015/12/07 14:27:18] <maths22> What was wrong with 0.3.6?
[2015/12/07 14:27:34] <brmbrmcar> It was too soon.
[2015/12/07 14:27:36] <mt> dunno
[2015/12/07 14:28:06] <mt> would have to look at the logs for whatever month, I think april
[2015/12/07 14:29:30] <mt> the thing is, we decided to at least use semver now

[2015/12/07 14:33:57] <mt> what I proposed: 2015-05-01 20:23:35  mt      speaking of bugfix releases, I'd suggest 0.3.5a instead of 0.3.5.1 (the latter looks ugly imho)
[2015/12/07 14:34:11] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2015/12/07 14:34:16] <mt> no one complained (Tobbi, Seebi were active at that point)
[2015/12/07 14:34:54] <mt> two days later, 'Change version number to 0.3.5a' was committed
[2015/12/07 14:35:58] <brmbrmcar> Ooh...
[2015/12/07 14:36:08] <brmbrmcar> And then released?

[2015/12/07 17:27:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: Couldn't we store documentation in markdown?
[2015/12/07 17:27:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: Should Flexlay follow the SuperTux SemVer system
[2015/12/07 17:27:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Problem is displaying it
[2015/12/07 17:27:21] <Tobbi> right...
[2015/12/07 17:27:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: I really don't have any preference...we could, though.
[2015/12/07 17:27:46] <Tobbi> Since previous versions of the editor were named after the release as well.
[2015/12/07 17:28:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, I will see if I can come up with a 0.4.0 release.
[2015/12/07 17:28:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: I'd rather skip a 0.4.0 release for the editor.
[2015/12/07 17:28:40] <Tobbi> It's just not ready yet.
[2015/12/07 17:28:44] <Tobbi> No layer toggling etc...
[2015/12/07 17:28:45] <Karkus> Actually, that kind of makes no sense
[2015/12/07 17:29:11] <Karkus> It can't be considered 'stable' for a while
[2015/12/07 17:29:16] <Tobbi> exactly.
[2015/12/07 17:29:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: However, if we name it 0.3 or something, it might be confusing.
[2015/12/07 17:29:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, how about Flexlay can join the SuperTux versioning system at 0.5.0
[2015/12/07 17:29:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: sounds good.
[2015/12/07 17:30:21] <Karkus> Okay, I'll set up a milestone for... when was it? Ah, halloween 2031
[2015/12/07 17:31:06] <Tobbi> Karkus: Exactly... :D
[2015/12/07 17:31:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: We wanted to release a test build, didn't we?
[2015/12/07 17:32:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: We did
[2015/12/07 17:32:08] <Tobbi> Was it announced on the forum?
[2015/12/07 17:32:18] <Karkus> I didn't announce anything
[2015/12/07 17:32:19] <Tobbi> aka 2 weeks before the release to make sure no critical issues were found...
[2015/12/07 17:32:25] <Tobbi> Never mind then.
[2015/12/07 17:32:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: We should do it though.
[2015/12/07 17:32:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's professional
[2015/12/07 17:33:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, we can upload a beta release on Github?
[2015/12/07 17:33:22] <Tobbi> But that might be considered official by some people.
[2015/12/07 17:33:23] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yep. 0.4.0b right?
[2015/12/07 17:33:28] <Tobbi> Okay, that might be good.
[2015/12/07 17:33:36] <maths22> No letters in tags-it will make things be angry
[2015/12/07 17:33:41] <Karkus> It is official, but not a full release
[2015/12/07 17:33:52] <Karkus> maths22: Okay, okay.
[2015/12/07 17:34:02] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2015/12/07 17:34:10] <Karkus> But how can we indicate that it is a beta release
[2015/12/07 17:34:13] <Tobbi> hrm.

[2015/12/07 17:36:17] <maths22> I'll think about this later.  I have an economics final to finish preparing for :(
[2015/12/07 17:36:27] <Karkus> maths22: Still SemVer though?
[2015/12/07 17:37:00] <maths22> Karkus: Yep
[2015/12/07 17:37:11] <Karkus> maths22: Okay
[2015/12/07 17:37:13] <maths22> Semver appears to indicate the correct way to do it is 0.4.0beta
[2015/12/07 17:37:20] <maths22> Sorry - NO!
[2015/12/07 17:37:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could have a project view for a SuperTux add-on for Flexlay... that includes levels, worldmaps, and other media that gets packaged.
[2015/12/07 17:37:25] <maths22> 0.4.0-beta
[2015/12/07 17:37:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes, I've been thinking about the concept of "Projects"
[2015/12/07 17:37:57] <maths22> I need to come up with a way to meaningfully parse that and differentiate the beta from final releases
[2015/12/07 17:38:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes, I've been thinking about the concept of "Project View" issue
[2015/12/07 17:38:05] <maths22> (in the version number)
[2015/12/07 17:38:28] <Tobbi> Karkus: I think it would really make sense. Also, it might give people the idea that they can create their own content and package it.
[2015/12/07 17:38:45] <leper`> maths22: -beta is still bad if you expect someone to package it
[2015/12/07 17:38:49] <Tobbi> I'll crate an issue.
[2015/12/07 17:38:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: So, you make a project, add some levels and a worldmap, package it and send it off to be considered. All from the editor
[2015/12/07 17:38:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: Sounds good.
[2015/12/07 17:39:03] <Tobbi> Sounds great, actually.
[2015/12/07 17:39:04] <Karkus> PyGitHub3 will help here.
[2015/12/07 17:40:06] <maths22> leper`: The only packaging is going to be automatic unoffical packaging
[2015/12/07 17:40:19] <Not-e81f> [02flexlay] 07tobbi opened issue 03#44: Project View - 13http://git.io/vRX4b
[2015/12/07 17:40:23] <leper`> so you mean more of an RC?
[2015/12/07 17:40:28] <Karkus> maths22, leper` and Tobbi: We can call it 0.4.0 beta, *not make a tag*, but create packages for people to test now, then remove them
[2015/12/07 17:40:47] <Karkus> not an official release, just for testing
[2015/12/07 17:40:49] <maths22> Karkus: We can't make it a github release then
[2015/12/07 17:41:02] <Karkus> maths22: Do we have to do that?
[2015/12/07 17:41:05] <maths22> GitHub allows "pre-releases", but they need a tag
[2015/12/07 17:41:09] <maths22> Karkus: not really
[2015/12/07 17:41:21] <Tobbi> I really don't want people to pick up the pre-release...
[2015/12/07 17:41:27] <Tobbi> So, I'd vote against github.
[2015/12/07 17:41:44] <maths22> I think we should just declare one of the automatic builds to be the "pre-release"
[2015/12/07 17:42:00] <maths22> Probably one that hasn't yet been built, but still
[2015/12/07 17:42:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: If they pick it up that's great. They can find issues and help us fix them before 0.4.0 so it's super stable
[2015/12/07 17:42:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Like my Windows bug
[2015/12/07 17:42:22] <maths22> Karkus: What Windows bug?
[2015/12/07 17:43:11] <Karkus> maths22: Didn't you hear about my issue in which whenever the game lost focus on windows it crashed?
[2015/12/07 17:43:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am concerned that people think this is an official "beta" release, like 0.3.5... So that software sites pick it up etc. Because we normally don't release that often.
[2015/12/07 17:43:21] <maths22> Karkus: I didn't
[2015/12/07 17:43:24] <maths22> What build number?

[2015/12/07 17:44:10] <Tobbi> maths22: Will you add the glbinding dependency to .travis.yml or shall I do that?
[2015/12/07 17:45:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: We can put up signs around it and a guarded fence to alert people that it is a beta testing release

[2015/12/07 17:45:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could actually mark it as pre-release and specifically display a "warning".
[2015/12/07 17:45:50] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2015/12/07 17:45:54] <maths22> Karkus: Sure.  Can you tell me what windows version now?
[2015/12/07 17:46:09] <Karkus> maths22: You mean, Windows 10?
[2015/12/07 17:46:31] <Karkus> Windows 10 actual legit version dual booting with Linux Mint
[2015/12/07 17:47:12] <maths22> Karkus: OK.
[2015/12/07 17:47:19] <maths22> I'm on Windows 10 and it likes me
[2015/12/07 17:47:37] <maths22> Did you make a bug for that crash issue?
[2015/12/07 17:47:41] <Karkus> maths22: Even when the game loses focus?
[2015/12/07 17:47:59] <leper`> Tobbi: But milestone2 also displayed some under construction warning
[2015/12/07 17:48:08] <Tobbi> leper`: True...
[2015/12/07 17:48:11] <leper`> so I'd suggest you call that thing a release candidate
[2015/12/07 17:48:14] <maths22> Karkus: Yes
[2015/12/07 17:48:23] <leper`> which should tell packagers that it isn't an actual release
[2015/12/07 17:48:23] <Karkus> maths22: Hmm.
[2015/12/07 17:48:24] <Tobbi> might make sense.
[2015/12/07 17:48:31] <leper`> (which a beta or alpha label does not do)
[2015/12/07 17:48:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: Create a new Logo
[2015/12/07 17:48:46] <Karkus> And stick that in
[2015/12/07 17:48:50] <maths22> Karkus: Did it leave any kind of crash log?
[2015/12/07 17:48:54] <Karkus> Actually...
[2015/12/07 17:48:58] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/07 17:49:02] <Karkus> maths22: No. It froze
[2015/12/07 17:49:14] <maths22> Karkus: Lovely
[2015/12/07 17:49:28] <maths22> Anyways, try the latest build tomorrow, and we will se
[2015/12/07 17:49:32] <maths22> s/se/see/
[2015/12/07 17:49:32] <red_bot> maths22 meant: "Anyways, try the latest build tomorrow, and we will see"
[2015/12/07 17:49:42] <Karkus> maths22: I had to run it from the terminal to keep focus for some reason. If I ran it from the start menu it crashed straight away
[2015/12/07 17:49:56] <maths22> My start menu one definitely works
[2015/12/07 17:50:13] <Karkus> maths22: Hey, I tell you what, as a christmas gift I will go through the pain of doing it now :D
[2015/12/07 17:50:25] <maths22> Karkus: let me guess.  You have to restart?

[2015/12/07 18:15:45] <Karkus_on_windos> Problem is I have to click on all the More Info > Advanced options etc.
[2015/12/07 18:16:13] <Karkus_on_windos> If it is a virus, it'd better not have touched my Linux partition
[2015/12/07 18:16:53] <maths22> Karkus_on_windos: I promise, not a virus :)
[2015/12/07 18:17:22] <Karkus_on_windos> Nope, still not working
[2015/12/07 18:17:24] <Karkus_on_windos> :(
[2015/12/07 18:18:02] <Karkus_on_windos> If I minimise the window, the music keeps playing and I can click things, but I can't see anything. Is this an SDL problem?
[2015/12/07 18:18:10] <Karkus_on_windos> maths22: ^
[2015/12/07 18:18:31] <maths22> Karkus_on_windos: So you minimize it and then maximize it, and it is blank?
[2015/12/07 18:18:42] <Karkus_on_windos> Yep. Can't see a thing
[2015/12/07 18:18:46] <maths22> Same behavior on my machine
[2015/12/07 18:18:56] <Karkus_on_windos> maths22: Damn
[2015/12/07 18:19:02] <maths22> I thought you meant lose focus like put something in front of it
[2015/12/07 18:19:12] <maths22> And yes, probably a SDL thing.  I'll investigate later
[2015/12/07 18:19:30] <Karkus_on_windos> maths22: That was a problem before I think, but it's not anymore.
[2015/12/07 18:19:37] <Karkus_on_windos> I can't remember
[2015/12/07 18:19:47] <Karkus_on_windos> As long as I don't minimise it, it's fine.
[2015/12/07 18:20:20] <maths22> Interesting...
[2015/12/07 18:20:33] <maths22> If I minimze and then maximize, and then resize the window, it turns black
[2015/12/07 18:21:55] <maths22> Karkus_on_windos: Are you using integrated intel graphics?
[2015/12/07 18:22:04] <Karkus_on_windos> Yes
[2015/12/07 18:22:17] <Karkus_on_windos> Are you?
[2015/12/07 18:22:24] <Karkus_on_windos> I'm on a Laptop
[2015/12/07 18:22:52] <maths22> See https://community.roonlabs.com/t/windows-8-1-blank-white-screen-after-maximising/1874/24
[2015/12/07 18:23:49] <maths22> It might be the same thing
[2015/12/07 18:24:05] <Karkus_on_windos> maths22: Okay, so what's at the root of this problem? Is it SDL? I think it is
[2015/12/07 18:24:15] <Karkus_on_windos> I think it is the same problem I mean
[2015/12/07 18:24:51] <maths22> Karkus_on_windos: I think it is opengl

[2015/12/07 18:29:17] <Karkus_on_windos> maths22: Can't we set it up to go to SDL automatically?
[2015/12/07 18:29:50] <Karkus_on_windos> And also now I'm getting graphical glitches
[2015/12/07 18:29:52] <Karkus_on_windos> Are you?
[2015/12/07 18:29:59] <maths22> A bit
[2015/12/07 18:30:07] <maths22> this is the tradeoff
[2015/12/07 18:30:51] <maths22> SDL is not hardware-accelerated, but it also doesnt have the intel glitch
[2015/12/07 18:30:59] <Karkus_on_windos> maths22: Like lines between the tiles?

[2015/12/08 09:24:22] @ Quit: Tobbi: Ping timeout: 272 seconds
[2015/12/08 09:24:38] <jesusalva> There is 10:21, when I woke up, correct?
[2015/12/08 09:25:18] <head8debian> jesusalva: Well, we have daylight savings time, so its now 9:22.
[2015/12/08 09:26:01] <jesusalva> So. Summer time. You go one hour backwards? I go one hour foward. So now I'm on GMT -0200.
[2015/12/08 09:26:07] <jesusalva> When usual is GMT -0300.
[2015/12/08 09:26:54] <jesusalva> This makes easier to talk with people like Tobbi and giby, as they usually are on GMT +0200 timezone.
[2015/12/08 09:27:03] <jesusalva> The difference goes from 5 to 4 hours.
[2015/12/08 09:27:14] <head8debian> jesusalva: We go forward one hour in spring and back one in fall. I hate it.
[2015/12/08 09:27:33] <jesusalva> Same here.
[2015/12/08 09:27:43] <jesusalva> However I learnt to like it.
[2015/12/08 09:28:13] <jesusalva> All right you'll never get used to time. When you finally understand time, it changes again.
[2015/12/08 09:28:34] <jesusalva> So I read by sun ("The sun is marking 13:00") and then I add one on summertime.
[2015/12/08 09:29:00] <jesusalva> A lot of people who I know dislikes it too. Some like because they get home "ealier"
[2015/12/08 09:29:13] <jesusalva> Others dislike because then they wake up on dark.
[2015/12/08 09:29:56] <jesusalva> And some dislikes even more because they work 'till the sun set. (Not allowed per law) And that way the sun takes longer to set (it takes longer to set on summer anyway)
[2015/12/08 09:30:43] <jesusalva> After all, day is bigger on summer, and night is bigger on winter, and only on the first day of spring/fall they have the same length, correct, head8debian?

[2015/12/08 09:43:51] <head8debian> jesusalva: True.
[2015/12/08 09:44:07] <head8debian> jesusalva: I don't like getting up when its so dark. :)
[2015/12/08 09:44:48] <jesusalva> Haha! Thankfully, during over half of it, I'm on vacations and can wake up late. ;)
[2015/12/08 09:45:18] <head8debian> jesusalva: Heh, i have to get up every day at the same time no matter what. :)
[2015/12/08 09:45:27] <jesusalva> And I usually live near the school, which starts at 07:00, so even on summer time, I still wake up when it's bright.
[2015/12/08 09:45:57] <jesusalva> Vacations can be annoying imo. It's a time which you don't do absolutely nothing.
[2015/12/08 09:46:17] <jesusalva> No work, no stress... Boring, in some ways.
[2015/12/08 09:47:11] <head8debian> jesusalva: heh, seems like i always have something to do, and the days are never quite long enough. :)
[2015/12/08 09:47:15] @ Quit: alket: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2015/12/08 09:47:26] <head8debian> Maybe if i didn't sit in IRC yacking i could get more done. :D
[2015/12/08 09:47:50] <jesusalva> Even on regular school days, I find myself bored with nothing to do.
[2015/12/08 09:48:23] <jesusalva> So I joined Student Council. Was secretary. Become President. Downgraded myself to 2nd president, and then went back to secretary.
[2015/12/08 09:48:35] <head8debian> jesusalva: I guess we are quite oposite then. :)
[2015/12/08 09:48:52] <head8debian> Wanna come over in your free time and help me get some stuff done? :D
[2015/12/08 09:49:02] <jesusalva> And yet, I didn't lost influence on the council. I was probably the secretary who took most executive decisions.
[2015/12/08 09:49:22] <jesusalva> Hm. If you pay my plane ticket, I don't mind. ;)
[2015/12/08 09:49:34] <head8debian> o_O I think i will pass.
[2015/12/08 09:49:34] <jesusalva> (Just joking anyway. I'm not cut for manual work)
[2015/12/08 09:49:58] <jesusalva> My cut is mostly paperwork. Theorics.
[2015/12/08 09:50:04] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/12/08 09:50:16] <jesusalva> Do executive decisions and reports, that's my concept of cool.
[2015/12/08 09:50:25] * jesusalva may be exaggerating.
[2015/12/08 09:50:42] <jesusalva> That's why even as secretary I still took a lot of executive decisions.
[2015/12/08 09:50:54] <head8debian> My legs are still very sore. Last friday i had a 200lb kid jump on my back, and i could not hold him up. Feels like he pulled all my leg muscles appart.
[2015/12/08 09:50:59] <head8debian> :D
[2015/12/08 09:51:17] <head8debian> jesusalva: Sounds like you enjoy what you do somewhat. :)
[2015/12/08 09:51:18] <jesusalva> Amazing! I mean, awful.
[2015/12/08 09:51:29] * jesusalva took this out of a movie
[2015/12/08 09:51:36] <head8debian> Im only 150lbs myself. :p
[2015/12/08 09:51:51] <jesusalva> head8debian: I like. If I don't like, I usually quit. Simple like that.
[2015/12/08 09:52:05] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/12/08 09:52:16] <jesusalva> head8debian: I'm about 40 kg, a little heavier. I eat every 2 hours, right now I'm eating a cookie, and have a cookie pack on my desk.
[2015/12/08 09:52:50] <jesusalva> There's no point in keep doing something I don't like, most of times. THat's why I quit. But I don't like quitting, so I simply don't join.
[2015/12/08 09:53:08] * jesusalva is very weird.
[2015/12/08 09:53:53] <jesusalva> Style: My favorite food contains what I hate most. Not really, eggs with potato are both good.
[2015/12/08 09:54:04] <head8debian> Heh. :-)
[2015/12/08 09:54:14] <jesusalva> But like, I hate, soy, let's say. And my favorite food, say, have soy.
[2015/12/08 09:54:54] <head8debian> jesusalva: Your 40kg? Thats like 90 pounds isnt it?
[2015/12/08 09:55:05] <jesusalva> No idea. :P
[2015/12/08 09:55:40] <jesusalva> An average person weights about 60kg to 70kg.
[2015/12/08 09:56:25] <jesusalva> 80kg is fat, 100kg is very very fat, 120kg... Is the fat guy who sits on his couch watching TV and eating all day long, and only leaves to see the doctor.
[2015/12/08 09:56:43] <jesusalva> And have health problems by serious overweight.
[2015/12/08 09:57:51] <head8debian> Maybe my calculations are wrong.
[2015/12/08 09:58:06] <jesusalva> No idea. How much an average person weights?
[2015/12/08 09:59:00] <head8debian> But then again, im the brazil opinion of fat is diferent than the american opinion of fat.
[2015/12/08 09:59:24] <head8debian> If duckduckgo is right, 100kg is 220LBs.
[2015/12/08 09:59:33] <jesusalva> I think an american weights about 70~80kg, not sure.
[2015/12/08 10:00:01] <jesusalva> Maybe more.
[2015/12/08 10:00:59] <head8debian> Yeah, average for men is is about 80kg.
[2015/12/08 10:01:17] <head8debian> Im roughly 70kg, i think.
[2015/12/08 10:02:14] <head8debian> 80kg is fat? o_O We consider that quite skinny.
[2015/12/08 10:02:17] <jesusalva> Makes sense.
[2015/12/08 10:02:57] <head8debian> Are Brazilians just bones with skin stretched on top? :)
[2015/12/08 10:03:00] <head8debian> No insult. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:03:04] <jesusalva> I wonder what I am. :/
[2015/12/08 10:03:13] <jesusalva> I'm thin on my country.
[2015/12/08 10:03:45] <jesusalva> head8debian: I think that's correct. I'm about 88 pounds.
[2015/12/08 10:04:06] <head8debian> jesusalva: How tall are you?
[2015/12/08 10:04:20] <jesusalva> Hm. About 1.7meters. And you?
[2015/12/08 10:04:30] <head8debian> Ugg, conversions. :)
[2015/12/08 10:04:37] <jesusalva> Yep, same here.
[2015/12/08 10:04:46] <jesusalva> Is it difficult to not use SI? :/
[2015/12/08 10:05:21] <head8debian> Im roughtly 1.85meters
[2015/12/08 10:05:38] <head8debian> jesusalva: You must be a rack of bones, IMO. :)
[2015/12/08 10:05:50] <head8debian> No insult intended. :)
[2015/12/08 10:05:57] <jesusalva> I'm skinny, that's for sure. :/
[2015/12/08 10:06:07] * jesusalva assumes he understood the word.
[2015/12/08 10:06:14] <head8debian> We just don't have that many people your age and height that weigh so little.
[2015/12/08 10:06:27] <jesusalva> Same here. ;D
[2015/12/08 10:06:29] <head8debian> But your fine. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:06:37] <jesusalva> Most weight between 50~60kg.
[2015/12/08 10:06:56] <head8debian> Which is still quite light.
[2015/12/08 10:06:56] <jesusalva> Hmm... 110 to 132 lb
[2015/12/08 10:07:07] <head8debian> Compared to us Americans, anyways. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:07:37] <jesusalva> Yes, I'm not really sure 'cause I don't go asking everyones weight. After all, about 80% of my class is composed of girls. Our class have 41 students.
[2015/12/08 10:07:54] <jesusalva> Which is annoying 'cause 41 cannot be divided, except by 1 and 41.
[2015/12/08 10:08:10] <head8debian> jesusalva: Ah. Girls are generally lighter, or they try to be anyways. Heh. :)
[2015/12/08 10:08:24] <jesusalva> A student with 65kg is not fat. About 143 lb.
[2015/12/08 10:08:34] <head8debian> No, definately not.
[2015/12/08 10:08:59] <head8debian> jesusalva: How did we get on this subject? :p
[2015/12/08 10:09:05] <jesusalva> I'm pretty sure my parents have about 70 kg, on most 80.
[2015/12/08 10:09:10] * jesusalva reads logs
[2015/12/08 10:09:14] <head8debian> Oh, yes, i remember. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:09:20] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/12/08 10:09:31] <jesusalva> We were on summer time.
[2015/12/08 10:09:46] <jesusalva> And then you commented an incident.
[2015/12/08 10:09:54] <head8debian> :-0
[2015/12/08 10:09:56] <head8debian> )
[2015/12/08 10:09:58] <head8debian> ***
[2015/12/08 10:10:14] <jesusalva> Which a "car of 90 kg (fat for sure) got on you"
[2015/12/08 10:10:25] * jesusalva is not being serious
[2015/12/08 10:10:38] <head8debian> What? :-0
[2015/12/08 10:10:39] <head8debian> )*
[2015/12/08 10:10:42] <jesusalva> We use 'truck', but I'm not sure how that would sound for you.
[2015/12/08 10:11:05] <head8debian> jesusalva: I prefer the word "truck" over car... mainly because i don't want to drive a car. :)
[2015/12/08 10:11:14] <jesusalva> Managed to sell it?
[2015/12/08 10:11:24] <head8debian> jesusalva: Hmm?
[2015/12/08 10:11:35] <jesusalva> You were trying to sell it some time ago.
[2015/12/08 10:11:38] <jesusalva> If I'm not mistaken.
[2015/12/08 10:12:08] <head8debian> jesusalva: You're correct. Yes, i did manage to sell it.
[2015/12/08 10:12:22] <jesusalva> My memory is doubled. I have one doing something important (talk to you) and another who just shuffles though memory log files. So I remember random things even if it's not what I want.
[2015/12/08 10:12:24] <head8debian> jesusalva: Actually, ive had 2 cars that ive fixed up and managed to sell.
[2015/12/08 10:12:35] <jesusalva> By example, I need to complete ST translations.
[2015/12/08 10:12:42] <head8debian> jesusalva: Im working on another car ATM.
[2015/12/08 10:12:45] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/12/08 10:12:48] <jesusalva> :)
[2015/12/08 10:13:22] <jesusalva> How much you gain on that? After all, you have costs getting the broken car and fixing it.
[2015/12/08 10:13:38] <head8debian> jesusalva: I made $300 on my last car.
[2015/12/08 10:13:53] <head8debian> jesusalva: But they are quite time consuming to fix and sell. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:13:54] <jesusalva> That's over R$ 1,000
[2015/12/08 10:14:20] <head8debian> jesusalva: Hmm? Is that your currency?
[2015/12/08 10:14:23] <jesusalva> About an average monthly paycheck.
[2015/12/08 10:14:37] <jesusalva> Yes. 'Real'. Tranlated, real or royal, both are correct.
[2015/12/08 10:14:37] <head8debian> jesusalva: Wow.
[2015/12/08 10:15:01] <head8debian> jesusalva: $300 up here is a weekly pay check.
[2015/12/08 10:15:02] <jesusalva> Actually it's most common either 1,000 or 2,000. Depends on job.
[2015/12/08 10:15:33] <jesusalva> head8debian: And we were the 7th in economics. ;D
[2015/12/08 10:15:34] <head8debian> jesusalva: But mind you that half of it goes to taxes...
[2015/12/08 10:15:41] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/12/08 10:15:54] <head8debian> Our economy is not doing so well ATM. :0
[2015/12/08 10:15:55] <head8debian> )*
[2015/12/08 10:16:00] <jesusalva> head8debian: IRRF, 27.5% of taxes taken before you get your money.
[2015/12/08 10:16:16] <head8debian> Its about 33% here.
[2015/12/08 10:16:30] <head8debian> Plus 15% on top of that.
[2015/12/08 10:16:38] <head8debian> Or was it 12%?
[2015/12/08 10:16:41] <jesusalva> And then you pay the IR, a parent of IRRF, which is the 'on top of that'.
[2015/12/08 10:16:48] <jesusalva> Not sure about the taxes of it.
[2015/12/08 10:17:05] <head8debian> m not the greatest with taxes, but they do add up.
[2015/12/08 10:17:10] <head8debian> I'm*
[2015/12/08 10:17:25] <jesusalva> There is also INSS, about 11%, but it stops increasing after R$ 4663.75.
[2015/12/08 10:17:50] <head8debian> jesusalva: As a dairy farm we go through over 20,000$ a month, but almost all of it goes to pay bills.
[2015/12/08 10:17:50] <jesusalva> So if you gain over that amount, you pay the same INSS. In other way, you pay more IRRF with worser taxes.
[2015/12/08 10:17:56] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/12/08 10:18:24] <jesusalva> Politicans like to create names for taxes. INSS. IRRF. IR. IPTU. ICMS. And the list goes on.
[2015/12/08 10:18:29] <head8debian> Cows are expensive critters to feed and bed and take care of. :)
[2015/12/08 10:18:46] <jesusalva> Forgot IPVA.
[2015/12/08 10:18:55] <head8debian> Heh, yes, names.
[2015/12/08 10:19:02] <jesusalva> Most start with 'I', 'Imposto' (Tax)
[2015/12/08 10:20:01] <jesusalva> Tax of social previdence. Tax over income. Tax over income reatined on source. Tax over residence. Tax over commercial operation. Tax over authomobilistc vehicle. Tax over profission.
[2015/12/08 10:20:13] <jesusalva> They forgot to create 'Tax over breathed air'
[2015/12/08 10:20:24] <head8debian> jesusalva: I was jsut going to say that.
[2015/12/08 10:20:29] <jesusalva> But they did a tax over water. It comes on your water bill.
[2015/12/08 10:20:45] <jesusalva> head8debian: I know, I read your mind. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:20:54] <head8debian> jesusalva: As my dad says, if they can tax you for it the *will* tax you for it.
[2015/12/08 10:21:01] <head8debian> j...
[2015/12/08 10:21:04] <head8debian> jesusalva: ...
[2015/12/08 10:21:11] <jesusalva> I agree.
[2015/12/08 10:21:47] <jesusalva> If you see the reunions, subject is: "Rename street 25 to street John of Debian Sourcehat".
[2015/12/08 10:22:07] <jesusalva> And they spend the whole day discussing and the conclusion: We talk about it on next reunion.
[2015/12/08 10:22:16] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/12/08 10:22:44] <jesusalva> Recess. We meet next week for our next reunion. Util then you're free to do whatever you want. You probably don't even need to go t/here.
[2015/12/08 10:23:41] <jesusalva> And not to say that they don't work on July, and probably on December and January as well. If I record well, about 45 days of recess on July month.
[2015/12/08 10:23:49] * jesusalva is not sure though.
[2015/12/08 10:24:33] <head8debian> Anyways, i need to get some school done. Nice talking to you again jesusalva. :)
[2015/12/08 10:24:45] <jesusalva> Nice for me too. See you. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:24:56] * jesusalva just had a lunch.
[2015/12/08 10:25:20] <jesusalva> Total time spent: 1 hour and 1 minute.

[2015/12/08 10:29:51] <maths22> (I just tested-it works in wine)
[2015/12/08 10:30:13] <maths22> Is anyone online right now to test the windows or os x builds on their machine?
[2015/12/08 10:31:24] * jesusalva uses Ubuntu 14.04 and haves no windows.
[2015/12/08 10:32:04] * jesusalva uses wine at most. And mess with DLL libraries for best performance possible.
[2015/12/08 10:33:09] <maths22> jesusalva: Fair.  Actually, can you see if the Windows build runs in wine for you?
[2015/12/08 10:33:22] <jesusalva> Where can I get it?
[2015/12/08 10:33:28] <maths22> brmbrmcar seemed to be having issues

[2015/12/08 10:36:51] <head8debian> maths22: I can test it in both wine and windows.
[2015/12/08 10:37:01] <head8debian> windows 10, that is.
[2015/12/08 10:37:53] <maths22> head8debian: If you could, that would be great
[2015/12/08 10:38:44] <head8debian> If it opens i figure everything is OK. :)

[2015/12/08 10:40:13] <brmbrmcar> Where's the startup file now?
[2015/12/08 10:40:13] <head8debian> I will, its still downloading.
[2015/12/08 10:40:19] <maths22> I think I fixed that last night, but I want to make sure the fix is in the build
[2015/12/08 10:40:34] <brmbrmcar> ITS WORKING
[2015/12/08 10:40:37] <maths22> brmbrmcar: C:/Program Files/SuperTux/bin/supertux2.exe (I think)
[2015/12/08 10:41:35] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Great!
[2015/12/08 10:42:02] <brmbrmcar> I am over-excited. :D
[2015/12/08 10:42:13] <maths22> Excited is good
[2015/12/08 10:44:24] <head8debian> maths22: How do you open a .msi? Just like a .exe?
[2015/12/08 10:44:30] <brmbrmcar> Yeah
[2015/12/08 10:45:53] <maths22> head8debian: Is this question for wine or Windows 10?
[2015/12/08 10:47:21] <head8debian> maths22: Ive got it. Wine. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:47:29] <head8debian> Wine is clunky in a terminal, well somewhat.
[2015/12/08 10:48:17] <maths22> I agree
[2015/12/08 10:48:29] <head8debian> maths22: https://paste.debian.net/342272/
[2015/12/08 10:49:07] <maths22> head8debian: What linux distro?
[2015/12/08 10:49:11] <head8debian> maths22:Arch.
[2015/12/08 10:49:24] <maths22> You need to install lib32-libldap or the equivalent for your platform
[2015/12/08 10:49:44] <maths22> That is Wine saying it can't load the necessary linux library to load the windows dll
[2015/12/08 10:49:51] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/12/08 10:50:03] <maths22> (Why CURL has an ldap dependency I don't know, but the ldap dll is built into windows)
[2015/12/08 10:50:14] <head8debian> Ok, installed, now i have anotehr error. :)
[2015/12/08 10:50:27] <head8debian> another*

[2015/12/08 10:51:50] * head8debian headbangs...
[2015/12/08 10:52:07] <maths22> What wine version is this?
[2015/12/08 10:52:38] <head8debian> maths22: 1.8
[2015/12/08 10:53:16] <head8debian> In other words, the latest version.
[2015/12/08 10:53:34] <maths22> Interesting.  It seems to work on 1.6 (in my Debian VM)
[2015/12/08 10:55:40] <maths22> Is this 32 or 64 bit wine
[2015/12/08 10:56:48] <head8debian> maths22: I belive 64 bit.
[2015/12/08 10:57:04] <maths22> Also, can you paste the list of files in drive_c/Program Files (x86)/SuperTux/bin
[2015/12/08 10:57:52] <maths22> And tell me what Windows version your winecfg is set to?
[2015/12/08 10:58:41] <head8debian> maths22: Its set to windows XP.
[2015/12/08 10:58:53] <head8debian> maths22: https://paste.debian.net/342281/
[2015/12/08 10:59:14] <head8debian> Ok, now set to windows 8.
[2015/12/08 10:59:17] <head8debian> No changes.
[2015/12/08 11:00:59] <maths22> head8debian: I was more curious if it was set to Windows 10, in which case it thought it might break
[2015/12/08 11:01:29] <head8debian> maths22: I will test supertux in Win 10 later, i have to reboot to do that and i hate rebooting. :p
[2015/12/08 11:01:32] <maths22> And the right DLLs got installed.  I bet it is a 64/32 bit thing
[2015/12/08 11:01:45] <head8debian> hmm.
[2015/12/08 11:01:46] <maths22> I'll investigate more later.  Wine64 1.6 doesn't like it
[2015/12/08 11:02:01] <maths22> I need to reboot the other direction-I have fedora but am right now in windows 10

[2015/12/08 11:37:03] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Do addon downloads work in wine?
[2015/12/08 11:37:17] <maths22> Karkus: Good news: the Windows build works in wine (at least in some cases)
[2015/12/08 11:37:48] <maths22> Bad news: the open GL issue is probably not fixable in software-Microsoft Outlook apparently suffers from the same issue
[2015/12/08 11:38:17] <leyyin> why do you need the windows build to run on wine ;) ?
[2015/12/08 11:38:36] <leyyin> seems completely pointless
[2015/12/08 11:41:09] <brmbrmcar> maths22: I'll check.
[2015/12/08 11:41:31] <brmbrmcar> I used my old .supertux2 files...
[2015/12/08 11:41:49] <maths22> leyyin: I don't actually care
[2015/12/08 11:42:00] <brmbrmcar> I can't do language packs.
[2015/12/08 11:42:02] <maths22> brmbrmcar seemed interested, so I figured I would check
[2015/12/08 11:42:10] <maths22> brmbrmcar: What error?
[2015/12/08 11:42:51] <brmbrmcar> schannel: failed to setup sequence direction
[2015/12/08 11:43:16] <brmbrmcar> Same for addons Check Online.
[2015/12/08 11:43:59] <maths22> brmbrmcar: That is a wine/curl error
[2015/12/08 11:44:18] <Karkus> maths22: Yay, now I can run SuperTux on Wine.
[2015/12/08 11:44:26] <maths22> It works with native windows schannel, so I won't worry about it too much for now
[2015/12/08 11:44:36] <maths22> Karkus: Apparently addons don't work (the curl downloading part)
[2015/12/08 11:44:43] <leyyin> Karkus, like trying to use a hammer to clean dishes ;)
[2015/12/08 11:44:47] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/08 11:45:15] <Karkus> maths22: I don't think wine is the most effective way to play supertux on Linux
[2015/12/08 11:45:19] <maths22> leyyin: Hopefully I'll get the open build service builds happy later
[2015/12/08 11:45:20] <brmbrmcar> leyyin: You don't get it, do you?

[2015/12/08 11:45:35] <Karkus> maths22: Shall I close the issue
[2015/12/08 11:45:39] <Karkus> ?
[2015/12/08 11:45:43] <leyyin> does the bot spam? because I ignored it :P

[2015/12/08 13:13:59] <Hume2> :D I'd advise it anyway.
[2015/12/08 13:14:09] <Tobbi> I don't know enough about SDL anyway.

[2015/12/08 13:31:22] <Karkus> Hume2: What _Programming_ languages do you know?
[2015/12/08 13:31:28] <brmbrmcar> I could try an convert a C file...
[2015/12/08 13:31:32] <brmbrmcar> Or C++
[2015/12/08 13:32:37] <Hume2> Convert C file?
[2015/12/08 13:33:14] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/08 13:33:17] <brmbrmcar> Which one?
[2015/12/08 13:34:45] <Hume2> What do you think by converting C file? Convert C to what?

[2015/12/08 13:35:50] <Hume2> What is that good for?
[2015/12/08 13:36:25] <brmbrmcar> I was asked to create it...
[2015/12/08 13:36:44] <brmbrmcar> But I need something to convert from until I can start being creative.
[2015/12/08 13:36:54] <Hume2> Don't you know that it was a trol?
[2015/12/08 13:37:15] <brmbrmcar> A trol?
[2015/12/08 13:37:48] <Hume2> Who has asked you to create it?
[2015/12/08 13:38:14] <brmbrmcar> It was discusserd that I would be asked while I was offline.
[2015/12/08 13:38:20] <brmbrmcar> So I asked them.

[2015/12/08 13:40:29] <brmbrmcar> That is what was discussed.

[2015/12/08 13:45:56] <brmbrmcar> Essentially a clone of C...
[2015/12/08 13:53:17] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: We were joking. Making OSs or Compilers is super difficult to do well, and takes many people and lots of time. I didn't think you'd take us seriously. You're welcome to have a go, of course, but it's really tough.
[2015/12/08 13:55:41] <brmbrmcar> Finally. The truth.
[2015/12/08 13:56:59] <brmbrmcar> You told me to make a language. I was planning to juast change the wording.
[2015/12/08 13:58:05] <Hume2> Almost everyone who knows what it is about can't take this seriously.
[2015/12/08 13:59:14] <brmbrmcar> I sort of knew it would make anything...

[2015/12/08 16:22:53] <Tobbi> Karkus: Good question. Maybe we should do it after new year's eve? I will have time then.
[2015/12/08 16:23:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, sometime early January?
[2015/12/08 16:23:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: sounds good.
[2015/12/08 16:24:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: One more thing: I defaulted to worldmap.strf for worldmaps. Think that's better than specifying the tileset...
[2015/12/08 16:24:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: Between you, me, maths22, Hume2 and mt, we can decide a date more precisely
[2015/12/08 16:24:20] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/12/08 16:24:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: We should possibly consider switching to PyQT5...
[2015/12/08 16:24:46] <Karkus> Tobbi: I know
[2015/12/08 16:25:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: I will make an issue. It's important to keep updated
[2015/12/08 16:25:10] <Tobbi> yup. I'll try to get to it.
[2015/12/08 16:25:16] <Tobbi> I'm installing it via macports...
[2015/12/08 16:25:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'm sure switching will be quite easy
[2015/12/08 16:25:24] <Tobbi> I hope so.
[2015/12/08 16:25:56] <Karkus> Look it up, there might be an automatic thing
[2015/12/08 16:27:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: I deliberately set it to ask with worldmaps due to world1 having its own worldmap tileset
[2015/12/08 16:28:03] <Tobbi> oh!
[2015/12/08 16:28:11] <Tobbi> I will check that.
[2015/12/08 16:28:12] <Karkus> Try opening it
[2015/12/08 16:28:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: And although you can change now with Edit > Change Tileset, you have to open the file again for the changes to have effect
[2015/12/08 16:28:58] <Tobbi> yeah, that's not good.
[2015/12/08 16:29:01] <Tobbi> I'll revert it then.
[2015/12/08 16:29:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: Or fix it :D
[2015/12/08 16:29:37] <Tobbi> Nah, too much hassle :D
[2015/12/08 16:29:40] <Tobbi> Unless...
[2015/12/08 16:30:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: The strf file is set in the worldmap.
[2015/12/08 16:30:26] <Karkus> Tobbi: How come there is no tileset mentioned in the worldmap .stwm file?
[2015/12/08 16:30:28] <Tobbi> So, we should fetch that.
[2015/12/08 16:30:30] <Karkus> Oh
[2015/12/08 16:30:31] <Tobbi> It is.

[2015/12/09 12:51:48] <brmbrmcar> That was what I was fixing in that pull request.
[2015/12/09 12:52:07] <Hume2> Karkus: Yes, I have tested it myself.

[2015/12/09 12:54:27] <Karkus> Hume2: I think he needs to rebase.
[2015/12/09 12:55:05] <Hume2> It is up-to-date.

[2015/12/09 12:57:25] <Hume2> Karkus: It's another branch.

[2015/12/09 12:59:22] <brmbrmcar> patch-2 is just so awesome.

[2015/12/09 13:11:17] <brmbrmcar> I cloned patch-2.
[2015/12/09 13:11:25] <Karkus> Why?
[2015/12/09 13:11:35] <brmbrmcar> I a very low on disk space.

[2015/12/09 13:13:16] <Karkus> How much disk space do you have?
[2015/12/09 13:13:20] <brmbrmcar> 400MB is too much generally...
[2015/12/09 13:13:34] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: You can remove it afterwards, right/
[2015/12/09 13:13:35] <Karkus> ?
[2015/12/09 13:13:54] <brmbrmcar> Fine. *sigh*
[2015/12/09 13:14:33] <Hume2> Only Tobbi has the right to say this here.
[2015/12/09 13:14:54] <Karkus> Hume2: Say what?
[2015/12/09 13:15:16] <Karkus> Also, Hume2, is this http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Scripting_reference up to date or not?
[2015/12/09 13:15:18] <Hume2> You know, the word begining on * and ending on *.
[2015/12/09 13:15:37] <Karkus> Hume2: Ah
[2015/12/09 13:15:45] <brmbrmcar> You do it.
[2015/12/09 13:16:00] <Hume2> It was my fault that I used this.
[2015/12/09 13:17:30] <Hume2> Karkus: I'm not sure. I can say that I added the add_bonus to SuperTux, because it was in the scripting refference but not in SuperTux.
[2015/12/09 13:18:45] <Karkus> Hume2: Is this where you learnt how to script?

[2015/12/09 13:19:56] <Hume2> Karkus: Yes.
[2015/12/09 13:20:12] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: use set_bonus instead.
[2015/12/09 13:20:14] <Karkus> Hume2: Okay. You can edit the wiki right?
[2015/12/09 13:20:39] <Hume2> Karkus: Not the locked pages.
[2015/12/09 13:20:53] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Is this the error you're getting when cherry picking/
[2015/12/09 13:20:54] <Karkus> ?
[2015/12/09 13:20:58] <Karkus> Hume2: okay
[2015/12/09 13:21:19] <maths22> Is there anyone here who would be able to grant me a wiki account?
[2015/12/09 13:21:21] <brmbrmcar> None works.
[2015/12/09 13:21:33] <brmbrmcar> @sKarkus:yes.
[2015/12/09 13:23:25] <Karkus> maths22: No, only Tobbi. He went on a quest set by Mathnerd, and achieved that status. He then made me an account.
[2015/12/09 13:23:40] <Karkus> maths22: You can make an account
[2015/12/09 13:23:45] <Karkus> I think...
[2015/12/09 13:24:15] <maths22> I can't :(
[2015/12/09 13:24:37] <Karkus> maths22: You'll have to wait for Tobbi then...
[2015/12/09 13:24:46] <maths22> Karkus: That's fine.  I'll ask him later
[2015/12/09 13:24:49] <brmbrmcar> I have only got a normal account.
[2015/12/09 13:25:01] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: How'd you get that?
[2015/12/09 13:25:09] <brmbrmcar> And also, what are you planning to change?
[2015/12/09 13:25:31] <brmbrmcar> Kakus: Right after all the crazy files I changed.
[2015/12/09 13:26:00] <maths22> brmbrmcar: For now, nothing particular
[2015/12/09 13:26:11] <maths22> I just feel like I should probably have access
[2015/12/09 13:26:24] <brmbrmcar> OK.

[2015/12/10 03:40:32] <Tobbi> I left my PC on.

[2015/12/10 08:54:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/12/10 08:55:53] <Tobbi> I'm gonna try flashing a Android M ROM now.
[2015/12/10 08:56:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: Elektrodenanschlusskabel
[2015/12/10 08:56:27] <head8debian> I need one. :D
[2015/12/10 08:56:31] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/12/10 08:57:11] <head8debian> Tobbi: It had german on the label, so i thought "oh, i will say it to Tobbi. :)
[2015/12/10 08:57:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: I keep getting these emails telling me i have to give people money...
[2015/12/10 08:57:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: You're Christian...
[2015/12/10 08:57:39] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/10 08:57:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: 8,500$ from one buisiness and 500$ from another...
[2015/12/10 08:57:49] <Tobbi> You have to give people money...
[2015/12/10 08:57:52] <Tobbi> and feel good about it.
[2015/12/10 08:57:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: So it must be spam.
[2015/12/10 08:58:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: They are trying to tell me that i bought that much from them. And never paid them.
[2015/12/10 08:58:23] <Tobbi> I see..
[2015/12/10 09:00:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: One does not simply walk into Elektrodenanschlusskabel.
[2015/12/10 09:00:11] <head8debian> Tobbi: Want me to send one to you? They all have these lovely javascript codes attached to them.
[2015/12/10 09:00:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: No thanks.
[2015/12/10 09:00:28] <head8debian> :D
[2015/12/10 09:00:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: OUCH! 1GB of updates today for arch.
[2015/12/10 09:00:51] <Tobbi> I'm trying to flash Android M...and it's gonna be difficult.
[2015/12/10 09:01:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Have fun. :D
[2015/12/10 09:01:16] <Tobbi> I most likely won't.
[2015/12/10 09:01:18] <head8debian> Tobbi: Why would it be dificult with a recovery?
[2015/12/10 09:01:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Because I need to transfer the file after clearing data/
[2015/12/10 09:01:41] <Tobbi> And I am kind of not sure how...I did it once...
[2015/12/10 09:01:46] <Tobbi> I can't remember.
[2015/12/10 09:01:49] <Tobbi> Probably try adb.
[2015/12/10 09:01:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: Arch had a C++ ABI change (whatever that means), so i figure thats why there is so much to download.
[2015/12/10 09:02:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: You need ABI...in order to get a good job here in Germany.
[2015/12/10 09:02:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Does your phone have a recovery enviroment?
[2015/12/10 09:02:31] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yes, and it's a tablet.
[2015/12/10 09:02:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: Then that shouldn't be too hard.
[2015/12/10 09:02:58] <Tobbi> I'll try...
[2015/12/10 09:02:59] <Tobbi> let's see..
[2015/12/10 09:03:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: Just dont delete your SD card.
[2015/12/10 09:03:06] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/12/10 09:03:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: I thought the data/ partition was the SD card?
[2015/12/10 09:03:17] <head8debian> Anyways, ive gotta go.

[2015/12/10 09:40:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: I managed to flash it...
[2015/12/10 09:40:03] <Tobbi> It's now booting.
[2015/12/10 09:40:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: But when i reformat mine the SD card is not touched.
[2015/12/10 09:40:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/12/10 09:40:14] <Tobbi> Takes quite a long time.
[2015/12/10 09:40:23] <Tobbi> But my tablet is around 5 years old.
[2015/12/10 09:40:33] <Tobbi> Galaxy Tab 10.1
[2015/12/10 09:42:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: My phone is almost 6 years old.
[2015/12/10 09:42:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: It will be slow on the first bootup.
[2015/12/10 09:42:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: Your phone runs android?
[2015/12/10 09:42:58] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes, i flashed Cynanogenmod on it.

[2015/12/10 11:54:01] <Tobbi> Hello Karkus.
[2015/12/10 11:54:10] <Karkus> Hey Tobbi
[2015/12/10 11:56:05] <brmbrmcar> 1600 20th December Tobbi's time?
[2015/12/10 11:56:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: You need to be more careful when merging brmbrmcar's pull requests
[2015/12/10 11:56:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: I assume I should.
[2015/12/10 11:56:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: For some reason I thought that level content is so easy to understand that not a lot can break there.
[2015/12/10 11:57:19] <brmbrmcar> Will the changes I made be applied to the right level?
[2015/12/10 11:57:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: And that's where you're wrong :D
[2015/12/10 11:57:44] <brmbrmcar> Or will I havwe to do that "risky" pull request?
[2015/12/10 11:57:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: I will refrain from merging any more of brmbrmcar's pull requests.
[2015/12/10 11:58:21] <Tobbi> Otherwise my sanity might get impaired.
[2015/12/10 11:58:33] <brmbrmcar> So I essentially cannot contribute.
[2015/12/10 11:58:56] @ leyyin joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/10 11:59:01] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: No, you can. Just be careful, and test it first.
[2015/12/10 11:59:20] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/10 11:59:34] <Karkus> And then once each person on the team has fully tested it, we might consider merging it
[2015/12/10 11:59:45] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/10 11:59:50] <brmbrmcar> I was going to, before Tobbi said he would refrain from merging.
[2015/12/10 11:59:54] <Tobbi> Karkus: But only after running it through travis and coverity...
[2015/12/10 11:59:59] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/10 12:00:10] <brmbrmcar> How many people are there on  the team?#
[2015/12/10 12:00:11] <Tobbi> It's for the project's safety.
[2015/12/10 12:00:16] <Tobbi> It's just me.
[2015/12/10 12:00:17] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/10 12:00:24] <Karkus> Hey!
[2015/12/10 12:00:31] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/10 12:00:36] <Tobbi> I am kidding, obviously.
[2015/12/10 12:00:52] <Karkus> Well, tbh my commits amount to 2 for the actual game...
[2015/12/10 12:01:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: But the editor is equally important.
[2015/12/10 12:01:05] <brmbrmcar> I have 3.
[2015/12/10 12:01:06] <Tobbi> Especially in 10 days...
[2015/12/10 12:01:34] <Karkus> The editor is especially important on 20th?
[2015/12/10 12:01:52] <Tobbi> Karkus: I meant: After the release.
[2015/12/10 12:02:00] <Tobbi> Sorry, I am occupied with some other stuff currently.
[2015/12/10 12:02:18] <brmbrmcar> Flexlay is tough to use.
[2015/12/10 12:02:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah, I know
[2015/12/10 12:02:25] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Why?
[2015/12/10 12:02:44] <brmbrmcar> You can't just click and run...
[2015/12/10 12:03:14] <brmbrmcar> And unless people find your method, they would probably be clueess.
[2015/12/10 12:03:25] <Tobbi> Wasn't click'n'run added recently?
[2015/12/10 12:03:37] <Karkus> click and run the editor
[2015/12/10 12:03:44] <Tobbi> Ah!
[2015/12/10 12:03:57] <brmbrmcar> Really?
[2015/12/10 12:04:02] <brmbrmcar> Awesome!!!
[2015/12/10 12:04:05] <Karkus> No.
[2015/12/10 12:04:14] <Karkus> That's OS specific
[2015/12/10 12:04:18] <brmbrmcar> But I still prefer the other editor.
[2015/12/10 12:04:25] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Why?
[2015/12/10 12:04:27] <Tobbi> Yeah, that's something we might need to work on
[2015/12/10 12:05:23] <brmbrmcar> Because it has a more easy-to-use style,more features  and far less actual bugs once you can get it to start.
[2015/12/10 12:05:39] <Tobbi> We intend to change that for flexlay as well.
[2015/12/10 12:06:04] <Tobbi> Luckily, grumbel doesn't actually develop flexlay anymore, so there're no actual upstream changes we need to merge.
[2015/12/10 12:06:49] <brmbrmcar> To make flexlay better, it should have all the new features recently implemented.
[2015/12/10 12:07:12] <Karkus> This is called development.
[2015/12/10 12:07:13] <brmbrmcar> And allowoptions for EVERY object for EVERY thing.
[2015/12/10 12:07:27] <Karkus> err, what?
[2015/12/10 12:08:07] <brmbrmcar> Like to allow those badguy bonus blocks
[2015/12/10 12:08:18] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I don't think you realize how difficult it is to develop an editor in python.
[2015/12/10 12:08:22] <Tobbi> You may as well help us develop.
[2015/12/10 12:08:27] <Karkus> Are they separate objects?
[2015/12/10 12:08:28] <brmbrmcar> It won' work at all on the old one.
[2015/12/10 12:08:37] <brmbrmcar> Python?
[2015/12/10 12:08:49] <brmbrmcar> If a program is hard to use, change it.
[2015/12/10 12:09:17] <brmbrmcar> That is why I think the old editor is  better, because the improvements were easier.
[2015/12/10 12:09:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: What's the problem with Python?
[2015/12/10 12:09:33] <Tobbi> Karkus: I meant in general.
[2015/12/10 12:09:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: I meant developing from scratch in general.
[2015/12/10 12:09:50] <Tobbi> Sorry, but I am currently overseeing something...
[2015/12/10 12:09:57] <Tobbi> So, my mind is occupied with something else.
[2015/12/10 12:10:00] <brmbrmcar> I'll take a look, but I will probabky not have a clue.
[2015/12/10 12:10:02] <leyyin> do you need a Python developer?
[2015/12/10 12:10:15] <Karkus> Developing from scratch is easier, (albeit more time consuming)
[2015/12/10 12:10:31] <Karkus> leyyin: Yeah. Seen one?
[2015/12/10 12:10:37] <Karkus> Pass me the net
[2015/12/10 12:10:49] <leyyin> https://www.freelancer.com/ indians are pretty cheap :D
[2015/12/10 12:11:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: We do not accept donations. Ask hiker to get off whatever he's on and pass us some of the donations he gets.
[2015/12/10 12:11:34] <leyyin> man, once on meth, always on meth
[2015/12/10 12:11:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: Also, no indians. They scare the shit out of me.
[2015/12/10 12:11:37] <Karkus> leyyin: I don't pay for them, I tie them to a chair and make them program till their fingers bleed.
[2015/12/10 12:11:50] <brmbrmcar> Which file does all the stuff like deadscripts and sprites?
[2015/12/10 12:12:23] <leyyin> this channel is so quiet, the bot is ignored :P
[2015/12/10 12:12:55] <Karkus> The bot hasn't said anything since I joined.
[2015/12/10 12:13:16] <leyyin> nice, I see you removed all the old crap https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay
[2015/12/10 12:14:03] <Tobbi> leyyin: It's all Karkus's work.
[2015/12/10 12:14:21] <leyyin> did you run pep8 on the project? :P
[2015/12/10 12:14:31] <Karkus> I have to say, it takes a lot of skill to remove so much code.
[2015/12/10 12:14:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, but you may do so...
[2015/12/10 12:14:39] <Tobbi> And give us the results.
[2015/12/10 12:14:47] <Karkus> leyyin: Probably 0
[2015/12/10 12:15:03] <leyyin> 0 warning from pep8? ;)
[2015/12/10 12:15:05] <leyyin> wanna bet?
[2015/12/10 12:15:07] <Tobbi> I know that grumbel didn't check not too long ago (1 year ago)
[2015/12/10 12:15:09] <Karkus> No
[2015/12/10 12:15:20] <Tobbi> And that's very recent in SuperTux terms.
[2015/12/10 12:15:40] <Karkus> 0/10 for pep8 quality
[2015/12/10 12:15:41] <leyyin> is there a future where this version of flexlay will me merged upstream?
[2015/12/10 12:15:48] <leyyin> *be
[2015/12/10 12:15:51] <Karkus> Ask grumbel
[2015/12/10 12:16:05] <Karkus> leyyin: Have you run it?
[2015/12/10 12:16:10] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, in the future, the editor won't be open source anymore... :P We'll sell it for 19,90 EUR.
[2015/12/10 12:16:12] <leyyin> because it is a forked project, contributions will not go to your daily graph
[2015/12/10 12:16:34] <leyyin> Karkus, no, why? :D
[2015/12/10 12:16:34] <brmbrmcar> Any answer to my question? I cannot contribute if I don't understand gthe file layout.
[2015/12/10 12:16:34] <Karkus> leyyin: Ah, who cares?
[2015/12/10 12:16:40] <leyyin> Karkus, me :P
[2015/12/10 12:16:46] <leyyin> github is good for your CV
[2015/12/10 12:16:56] <Karkus> leyyin: It is?
[2015/12/10 12:17:05] <leyyin> YES :)
[2015/12/10 12:17:07] <Karkus> I wouldn't say I'm proud of Flexlay
[2015/12/10 12:17:21] <leyyin> you should be proud of whatever you got
[2015/12/10 12:17:32] <Karkus> Every line I write spagettifies it further
[2015/12/10 12:17:34] <Tobbi> leyyin: I don't think Google found me through Github...It's not the email address I have there.
[2015/12/10 12:17:45] <Not-e81f> [02flexlay] 07leyyin forked the repository - 13http://git.io/vIwY1
[2015/12/10 12:17:49] <Tobbi> Oh no!
[2015/12/10 12:17:57] <leyyin> what?
[2015/12/10 12:18:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: You forked, that means you're gonna complain about code style etc.
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <leyyin> don't tell me the bot said I forked the project?
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <Tobbi> Yes, it did
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <leyyin> if I run pep8 fixer on it, it should be good
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <Tobbi> Alright, go ahead, and submit a pull request.
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <brmbrmcar> Right, will you guys implement allthat?
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <Tobbi> what is "allthat"?
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <brmbrmcar> You cannot ask me to contribut if you don't tell me a thing.
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <leyyin> .git directory is 38 MB :D
[2015/12/10 12:19:41] <leyyin> garbage
[2015/12/10 12:19:51] <brmbrmcar> Trash it.
[2015/12/10 12:19:54] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: It's not our fault if you're so annoying everyone has you on ignore.
[2015/12/10 12:19:55] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/10 12:20:05] <leyyin> who are you talking to?
[2015/12/10 12:20:08] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/10 12:20:29] <brmbrmcar> You didn;t answer my question.
[2015/12/10 12:20:53] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.
[2015/12/10 12:20:54] <brmbrmcar> Just tha I cannot unti I know what do do!
[2015/12/10 12:23:21] <leyyin> oh boy, pycharm is processing, this means it has a lot of files :D
[2015/12/10 12:23:31] <leyyin> only 124 files :D
[2015/12/10 12:25:04] <maths22> Tobbi: Could you create an account on the wiki for me?
[2015/12/10 12:25:13] <Tobbi> maths22: I believe so, one moment.
[2015/12/10 12:25:17] <maths22> Tobbi: Thanks!
[2015/12/10 12:27:14] <Karkus> leyyin: I didn't make this, it was grumbel.
[2015/12/10 12:27:27] <leyyin> yeah, no problems :P
[2015/12/10 12:27:41] <Karkus> So don't bully me
[2015/12/10 12:28:08] <Karkus> leyyin: Also, Pycharm is great
[2015/12/10 12:29:16] <Karkus> leyyin: How can I decrease the size of the .git folder?
[2015/12/10 12:29:25] <leyyin> you can't
[2015/12/10 12:29:30] <leyyin> want to modify history? ;)
[2015/12/10 12:30:05] <Tobbi> I'd rather not.
[2015/12/10 12:30:47] <maths22> Tobbi: You'd rather not what?
[2015/12/10 12:31:11] <Tobbi> maths22: modify history.
[2015/12/10 12:31:14] <Karkus> Can I remove WW2?
[2015/12/10 12:31:24] <leyyin> remove hitler
[2015/12/10 12:31:26] <leyyin> sure why not
[2015/12/10 12:32:08] <maths22> I would agree that it is generally inadvisible to modify history
[2015/12/10 12:32:21] <Tobbi> Check PM, maths22
[2015/12/10 12:32:26] <maths22> No one wants to experience the grandfather paradox first-hand
[2015/12/10 12:38:32] <brmbrmcar> The wiki Downloads should mention the nightly builds.
[2015/12/10 12:38:38] <Karkus> leyyin: Have you run pep8 on it?
[2015/12/10 12:38:43] <brmbrmcar> But I cannot access the page.
[2015/12/10 12:38:53] <Karkus> So should the website Downloads page
[2015/12/10 12:39:44] <brmbrmcar> Yeah, but in both cases mention that they mostly do not work.
[2015/12/10 12:39:45] <leyyin> a sec, busy with something else
[2015/12/10 12:39:56] <brmbrmcar> Without severe adjustment.
[2015/12/10 12:41:10] <maths22> These will be updated once I am satisfied with both the quality of the builds (which I think I am) and the download process/page (which I am not quite yet satisfied with)
[2015/12/10 12:42:03] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/10 12:42:05] <maths22> brmbrmcar: What do you mean about not working?
[2015/12/10 12:42:17] <brmbrmcar> The debs won't work at all.
[2015/12/10 12:42:37] <brmbrmcar> I tried it with a fresh Ubuntu install, nothing either.
[2015/12/10 12:42:42] <maths22> brmbrmcar: that's the OBS half that needs help

[2015/12/10 12:43:53] <brmbrmcar> What is OBS?
[2015/12/10 12:44:17] <maths22> Open Build Service: the system used to make the linux packages
[2015/12/10 12:44:23] <Karkus> I think Git is a great invention, but does anyone really need the whole history of an application?
[2015/12/10 12:45:18] <brmbrmcar> Ah, OK.
[2015/12/10 12:45:32] <maths22> Karkus: Probably not.  I personally liked the SVN model more, but it isn't perfect either
[2015/12/10 12:45:38] <brmbrmcar> I hate the way git ust overloads disk space.
[2015/12/10 12:46:01] <Karkus> How much disk space do you have, brmbrmcar?
[2015/12/10 12:46:45] <maths22> Interestingly, for 99% text-based repositories, a git clone may be about the same size as a full SVN checkout (i.e brlcad, which is currently on revision 66757)
[2015/12/10 12:47:03] <maths22> The full (compressed) history is actually about the same size as the SVN clean copy it creates
[2015/12/10 12:47:19] <Karkus> I don't understand SVN
[2015/12/10 12:47:28] <brmbrmcar> 3.5gb, try not to go below 2
[2015/12/10 12:47:37] <brmbrmcar> 9gb ssd.
[2015/12/10 12:47:48] <Karkus> What computer are you on?
[2015/12/10 12:47:53] <Karkus> A gameboy
[2015/12/10 12:47:54] <Karkus> ?
[2015/12/10 12:47:57] <maths22> Karkus: What about it don't you understand?
[2015/12/10 12:48:08] <brmbrmcar> Acer Chromebook 11
[2015/12/10 12:48:23] <Karkus> With 9Gb?
[2015/12/10 12:48:51] <Karkus> maths22: Well, which one is better in regards of size?
[2015/12/10 12:49:06] <brmbrmcar> They advertise 16, but even after complete developer reset only gets 9.
[2015/12/10 12:49:25] @ Hume2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/10 12:49:53] <Karkus> My Laptop has 1Tb
[2015/12/10 12:50:03] <brmbrmcar> 1tb is sill old.
[2015/12/10 12:50:21] <Karkus> Huh?
[2015/12/10 12:50:23] <maths22> Karkus: It depends.  For example, SVN would take up less space for SuperTux by a reasonable amount
[2015/12/10 12:50:37] <maths22> It would use about 166 + 166 MB for a full checkout
[2015/12/10 12:50:39] <brmbrmcar> 2tb is the new standard.
[2015/12/10 12:50:55] <maths22> (It stores a clean copy uncompressed along with the working copy)
[2015/12/10 12:51:00] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Yes, but all I'm saying is I'm not complaining
[2015/12/10 12:51:05] <maths22> Git is 484
[2015/12/10 12:51:15] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/10 12:51:20] <maths22> (Note that these numbers are based on some old revision, but it doesn't matter too much)
[2015/12/10 12:51:34] <jesusalva> 250 GB here. ;)
[2015/12/10 12:51:50] <maths22> The reason is that we have a good amount of binary files (in data) which compress poorly and where delta-style histories don't work
[2015/12/10 12:52:04] <Karkus> That's barely enough for windows jesusalva
[2015/12/10 12:52:09] <brmbrmcar> I have a terrible computer.
[2015/12/10 12:52:11] <jesusalva> I don't use windows.
[2015/12/10 12:52:16] <maths22> To some extent, this is probably why STK does a svn repo for data and a git repo for the code
[2015/12/10 12:52:25] <jesusalva> My Windows have bare minimum space.
[2015/12/10 12:52:27] <maths22> (Not that I recommend that approach, but it has its advantages)
[2015/12/10 12:52:39] <jesusalva> It also haves an android.
[2015/12/10 12:52:48] <jesusalva> Which I don't use, by the way.
[2015/12/10 12:53:20] <maths22> I should do the CPackSource stuff.  Soon...
[2015/12/10 12:53:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: Your commit with the tilesets doesn't write it to the file.
[2015/12/10 12:53:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know.
[2015/12/10 12:54:01] <Tobbi> But that has never worked.
[2015/12/10 12:54:21] <Karkus> No, we never had tilesets implemented.
[2015/12/10 12:54:35] <Karkus> properly
[2015/12/10 12:54:41] <Hume2> I'll just reconnect.
[2015/12/10 12:54:44] @ Quit: Hume2: Quit: Page closed
[2015/12/10 12:55:02] <jesusalva> ops, sorry, this netbook haves 320GB. My good notebook is the one of 250 GB. It's 40 GB to windows, 5GB for android, 5 GB for swap, and 100 GB for home and other 100 GB for root.
[2015/12/10 12:55:32] <jesusalva> Which sums up to 250 anyway. So I rounded /home and / space.
[2015/12/10 12:55:50] @ Hume2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/10 12:57:17] <brmbrmcar> Anyway, I have virtually no disk space. :D
[2015/12/10 12:58:41] <maths22> I realized that the biggest part of our downloads are actually the music files.
[2015/12/10 12:58:52] <maths22> Not that there is anything to do about that fact, but it is kind of interesting
[2015/12/10 12:58:56] <maths22> (Images come in 2nd)
[2015/12/10 12:59:28] <Hume2> There are many useless images.
[2015/12/10 12:59:58] <brmbrmcar> Like my sprites for *** *** ***s?
[2015/12/10 13:00:16] <brmbrmcar> I haven't implemented thedm, luckily.
[2015/12/10 13:00:30] <brmbrmcar> And they have no license.
[2015/12/10 13:00:45] <Hume2> No, I mean the phone.
[2015/12/10 13:00:47] <Tobbi> I have no idea what the hell you're talking about.
[2015/12/10 13:00:55] <Hume2> tele-phone

[2015/12/10 13:04:05] <maths22> The thing about the levels is that they compress very well
[2015/12/10 13:04:31] <maths22> Hume2: What was that supposed to be used for?
[2015/12/10 13:05:07] <Hume2> maths22: I think that this was supposed to be an info block, but it's now not used anywhere at all.
[2015/12/10 13:05:32] <brmbrmcar> I like it.
[2015/12/10 13:05:37] <Tobbi> A small image doesn't make a big difference.
[2015/12/10 13:05:47] <brmbrmcar> It could be an easter egg somewhere...
[2015/12/10 13:05:51] <Tobbi> Besides, I wasn't allowed to compress with imageoptim...
[2015/12/10 13:05:58] <Tobbi> otherwise, people will complain again.
[2015/12/10 13:06:16] <maths22> Tobbi: Can you share whatever script you used to do that?
[2015/12/10 13:06:17] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/10 13:06:17] <brmbrmcar> Think that is a good idea?
[2015/12/10 13:06:24] <Tobbi> maths22: It was a program...
[2015/12/10 13:06:25] <maths22> I'll make it part of the release (not debug) build process
[2015/12/10 13:06:27] <Tobbi> ImageOptim.
[2015/12/10 13:06:30] <maths22> :(
[2015/12/10 13:06:47] <Hume2> It's true that the majority of images are used somewhere.
[2015/12/10 13:06:47] <Tobbi> maths22: You might be able to compress with Zopfli...
[2015/12/10 13:06:54] <Tobbi> iirc, it's a google image compressor thing.
[2015/12/10 13:07:25] <Tobbi> maths22: https://github.com/google/zopfli
[2015/12/10 13:07:32] <maths22> All of the images we care about are PNGs, right?
[2015/12/10 13:07:46] <Tobbi> maths22: https://imageoptim.com/
[2015/12/10 13:07:54] <Tobbi> maths22: If I recall correctly, yes.
[2015/12/10 13:07:58] <maths22> :( some of the backgrounds are jpgs
[2015/12/10 13:08:06] <maths22> i.e. https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/images/background/cave2.jpg
[2015/12/10 13:08:34] <brmbrmcar> info_block has no sprite.
[2015/12/10 13:08:48] <brmbrmcar> Am I permitted to make one?
[2015/12/10 13:09:34] <Tobbi> info_block?
[2015/12/10 13:09:45] <maths22> There are 30 jpgs (including the credit images) and 1941 pngs.  I think I'll worry about the pngs
[2015/12/10 13:10:25] <brmbrmcar> You know, the phone!
[2015/12/10 13:10:46] <brmbrmcar> But it is cxalled info_block!
[2015/12/10 13:11:37] <brmbrmcar> I hate jpeg!
[2015/12/10 13:14:37] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Please, don't. I guess, we'll remove it one nice day.
[2015/12/10 13:14:55] <Tobbi> for god's sake, we're 10 days before a release
[2015/12/10 13:15:00] <Tobbi> Don't make drastic changes now.
[2015/12/10 13:15:35] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2015/12/10 13:15:50] <brmbrmcar> I guess you all hate my hats?
[2015/12/10 13:15:53] <Hume2> It's not used in any sprite, so it can't do any harm.
[2015/12/10 13:16:17] @ Quit: tuxdev_: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2015/12/10 13:16:29] <brmbrmcar> I wouldn't remove info_block, as it might upset someone who liked it. :D
[2015/12/10 13:16:47] <Hume2> Let's see...
[2015/12/10 13:17:39] <Hume2> It was before the year 2005.
[2015/12/10 13:18:13] <Hume2> It has been never used in any stable release.

[2015/12/10 13:19:13] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It's useless!
[2015/12/10 13:19:26] <brmbrmcar> For an info block!
[2015/12/10 13:19:40] <brmbrmcar> That is what it is designed for!
[2015/12/10 13:19:50] <brmbrmcar> I am making it useful!
[2015/12/10 13:20:15] <Hume2> So I need help, so I'll use the phone.
[2015/12/10 13:20:32] <Hume2> I don't know any number, so I just type something.
[2015/12/10 13:21:05] <Hume2> And I don't even need to speak and someone tells me a help without the need of knowing who I am.
[2015/12/10 13:21:47] <Hume2> And the random number even knows what to help me with.
[2015/12/10 13:22:32] <Hume2> Yes. And I can find a telephone in an icy wasteland, where's no electricity.
[2015/12/10 13:22:46] <Hume2> And what is more, it's working!
[2015/12/10 13:25:13] <Hume2> Isn't it a nice way of phoning? I bump into the telephone and it starts phoning!
[2015/12/10 13:26:59] <Karkus> Tobbi: What's the develop branch for?
[2015/12/10 13:27:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: I didn't create it.
[2015/12/10 13:27:27] <Tobbi> I believe it was grumbel.

[2015/12/10 13:39:09] <brmbrmcar> Sound effecyt?
[2015/12/10 13:39:40] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I found proof that you're not zero, by the way!
[2015/12/10 13:41:15] <brmbrmcar> I'm 1.
[2015/12/10 13:42:26] <brmbrmcar> I can tell you I am old enough for a GitHub account.
[2015/12/10 13:42:31] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You attend a high school.
[2015/12/10 13:42:36] <Tobbi> See.
[2015/12/10 13:42:50] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: one of your commits contain your high school e-mail address.
[2015/12/10 13:42:55] <Tobbi> Ergo...
[2015/12/10 13:43:11] <brmbrmcar> I wanna trash that.
[2015/12/10 13:43:20] <brmbrmcar> I disconnected it!
[2015/12/10 13:43:21] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You won't get a chance.
[2015/12/10 13:43:45] <Tobbi> You might have disconnected that e-mail, but you won't get a chance to trash it.
[2015/12/10 13:44:08] <brmbrmcar> I sould probably have faked it, as the school servers are easy to fake.
[2015/12/10 13:44:49] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: But still, I just wanted to tell you to stop this tomfoolery.
[2015/12/10 13:44:56] <Tobbi> It gets on our collective nerves.
[2015/12/10 13:48:49] <brmbrmcar> Should I dos the school servers?
[2015/12/10 13:53:13] <leyyin> Tobbi, so he is in highschool :D

[2015/12/10 13:53:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes, he is.
[2015/12/10 13:53:41] <Tobbi> I assumed as much already.
[2015/12/10 13:57:55] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/12/10 14:00:39] <Hume2> LOL, I thought that he's 11.
[2015/12/10 14:01:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Your surrounded by a bunch of high schoolers. :)
[2015/12/10 14:01:20] <brmbrmcar> OK now. Joke's over.
[2015/12/10 14:01:40] <Tobbi> I know.

[2015/12/10 14:11:39] <Tobbi> leyyin: ...
[2015/12/10 14:12:50] <leyyin> I apparently broke the editor, lemme fix the issue
[2015/12/10 14:14:15] <leyyin> ha, Christmas music :D
[2015/12/10 14:14:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: It's nice christmas music.
[2015/12/10 14:15:36] <brmbrmcar> What Vhristmas music?
[2015/12/10 14:15:37] <leyyin> I got sucked into the game :D
[2015/12/10 14:16:04] <brmbrmcar> At school they used an inappropriate song in an English lesson.
[2015/12/10 14:16:12] <brmbrmcar> Achristas son.
[2015/12/10 14:17:03] <leyyin> wait, supertux does not come with all the locales?
[2015/12/10 14:17:09] <leyyin> I have to download an addon?
[2015/12/10 14:17:28] <leyyin> this is new :D
[2015/12/10 14:17:33] <brmbrmcar> Ithink the language packs are for addons...
[2015/12/10 14:18:05] <leyyin> I am confused, there is in the language list, I did not install the language pack
[2015/12/10 14:18:10] <leyyin> so what is the diference?
[2015/12/10 14:18:57] <brmbrmcar> Er... I think language pac translates other stuff.
[2015/12/10 14:19:35] <Hume2> The christmas music is good except the tuc tuc thing.
[2015/12/10 14:21:31] <brmbrmcar> Tuc tuc?
[2015/12/10 14:21:44] <Hume2> I hate tuc tuc.
[2015/12/10 14:21:45] <maths22> leyyin: The .txt is need to make the windows builder happy.  We can get rid of the no-extension one
[2015/12/10 14:21:52] @ Quit: Tobbi: Ping timeout: 256 seconds
[2015/12/10 14:22:16] <maths22> Either WIX or NSIS (or maybe both) wanted the license file to have an extension, so I gave it one.
[2015/12/10 14:24:36] <jesusalva> ...As far as I know, COPYING file haves a MIME type of it's own.
[2015/12/10 14:24:52] <maths22> I have the feeling that, after this release, we need to make this language pack stuff clearer.
[2015/12/10 14:25:02] <maths22> Also, what does a language pack actually provide?
[2015/12/10 14:25:19] * jesusalva agrees 'cause he never heard about this language pack before.
[2015/12/10 14:25:23] <jesusalva> And I am a translator.
[2015/12/10 14:25:49] <maths22> jesusalva: I just looked at one of them-it appears to be translations for addons
[2015/12/10 14:26:23] <maths22> One of my projects for after this release is a better addon management backend-I think I will incorporate translations into that
[2015/12/10 14:26:35] <maths22> The translations should end up packaged with the addon, not separately
[2015/12/10 14:26:39] <jesusalva> I never saw, and this is first time I heard of. I only know that on Transifex I can translate the addons.
[2015/12/10 14:26:50] <jesusalva> maths22: I agree with that, though.
[2015/12/10 14:27:23] <jesusalva> No sense downloading the addon and translation separately. It seems like there is no translation after downloading the extra-level.
[2015/12/10 14:27:25] <maths22> Also, does anyone know why pressing alt in the menu acts like pressing enter?
[2015/12/10 14:28:14] <brmbrmcar> I want to know why both control and the action key work for making the earth Tux invincible...
[2015/12/10 14:29:35] <leyyin> wth, something is wrong with these imports O_O
[2015/12/10 14:30:20] <brmbrmcar> It doesn't any more.
[2015/12/10 14:35:32] <leyyin> ah, stupid python modules

[2015/12/10 16:25:22] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/12/10 16:25:46] <Tobbi> maths22: It is possible to package translations with add-ons. Problem is you need to update the add-on...
[2015/12/10 16:25:53] <Tobbi> when you only want to update translations.
[2015/12/10 16:26:18] <Tobbi> I agree we need to make that stuff clearer...
[2015/12/10 16:29:10] <maths22> Tobbi: This whole process will be improved with a better addon management system
[2015/12/10 16:29:24] <maths22> That is a nice post-4.0.0 project

[2015/12/10 16:30:00] <maths22> Tobbi: I'm not fully sure, but I'm going to think about what I envision later and then describe it.
[2015/12/10 16:30:04] <maths22> We will see...
[2015/12/10 16:31:26] <Tobbi> maths22: What I would like to have is periodic update checks and informing the user about add-on updates etc.

[2015/12/10 16:35:35] <Tobbi> Other things might be confusing.
[2015/12/10 16:35:42] <Tobbi> Do I have deja vu or did I write this before?

[2015/12/10 16:36:01] <brmbrmcar> You get black hats...
[2015/12/10 16:36:03] <Karkus> Confusing, no.
[2015/12/10 16:36:39] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/12/10 16:37:09] <brmbrmcar> And also, fire is primary, and people cannot complain about there not being christmas hats for the other pwerups.

[2015/12/10 16:38:41] <head8debian> I'd say stick with what we have.
[2015/12/10 16:39:03] <brmbrmcar> Other people liked them.
[2015/12/10 16:39:33] <brmbrmcar> It's just wierd not to change anything for the other flowers.
[2015/12/10 16:39:47] <Tobbi> It just doesn't match the christmas theme.
[2015/12/10 16:39:58] <Tobbi> But maybe I am the only one who thinks like that.
[2015/12/10 16:40:30] <head8debian> I personally think there is only 1 type of santa hat that seems to fit.
[2015/12/10 16:40:32] <brmbrmcar> Some people say "Santa used to be green".
[2015/12/10 16:40:42] <head8debian> Inverting the colors would be weird.
[2015/12/10 16:40:56] <head8debian> People would be like "Wha is that"?
[2015/12/10 16:41:09] <brmbrmcar> I sort of looks christmassy.
[2015/12/10 16:42:02] <brmbrmcar> I could change the hats to look better.

[2015/12/10 16:58:29] <maths22> To build these, GIT will not be required, and neither will the full history of the repository

[2015/12/10 17:46:37] <Tobbi> or rather auto-fixing stuff?
[2015/12/10 17:46:47] <leyyin> auto-fixing stuff according to a code style
[2015/12/10 17:47:06] <maths22> Also, if this source tarball builds, the build process is ready for release
[2015/12/10 17:47:07] <Tobbi> nice.

[2015/12/10 17:48:58] <Tobbi> maths22: OS X works fine. I just wonder why it "auto-detects" the OS language as English...
[2015/12/10 17:49:07] <Tobbi> Don't think it's a packaging fault, though.
[2015/12/10 17:49:15] <Tobbi> Actually...

[2015/12/10 17:56:46] <maths22> I don't know why they would work differently.  Without access to a mac where I can change the locale, I don't know that I have a good way to debug.

[2015/12/11 08:48:16] <jesusalva> head8debian, how much 'till release?
[2015/12/11 08:49:33] * jesusalva checks for the one with least strings untranslated.
[2015/12/11 08:49:59] <jesusalva> CTs or Michaels wins. Michael wasn't translated a single string yet, so I vote for CT in order to keep consistency.
[2015/12/11 08:50:30] <jesusalva> Odd.
[2015/12/11 08:51:15] <Tobbi> jesusalva: It was added fairly late.
[2015/12/11 08:51:23] <jesusalva> Tobbi: Is src/ctdabomb-worldmaps/levels/penny/10-lastnight.stl:3 level name properly formatted? "Last night for penny" -> "Last Night for Penny"
[2015/12/11 08:51:32] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2015/12/11 08:51:50] <Tobbi> jesusalva: i really don't know...
[2015/12/11 08:51:55] <Tobbi> It was CT who did that.
[2015/12/11 08:52:33] <jesusalva> Yes, but assuming that must levels have capitalization on first letter for each word, shouldn't there be a comment that the capitalization is intended?
[2015/12/11 08:53:08] <jesusalva> 70% of the levels on ST (or more) actually would say "Last Night for Penny" instead.
[2015/12/11 08:53:26] <Tobbi> jesusalva: We should add that to translator notices.
[2015/12/11 08:54:12] <jesusalva> So LOOOONG and Hard You Will Wish You Never Found It. --> Cool level name. ;)
[2015/12/11 08:55:11] <jesusalva> On other channel people were talking about open source economics. Almost gave me headache their price marking methods.
[2015/12/11 08:55:12] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/11 08:55:53] <jesusalva> ...Now, let's open Google Translator. Why would I try to remember what is "Moat" when Google Translator does it for me? ;)
[2015/12/11 09:02:13] <jesusalva> Funny language for "src/ctdabomb-worldmaps/levels/penny/extro.stl:3" name
[2015/12/11 09:05:08] <jesusalva> CT's levels fully translated, now I'll play something else before looking again at the untranslated resources.
[2015/12/11 09:20:59] <head8debian> jesusalva: 9 days?
[2015/12/11 09:21:17] <jesusalva> Did you already -figlet'ed it?
[2015/12/11 09:21:20] <jesusalva> :)
[2015/12/11 09:21:24] <head8debian> jesusalva: No. :)
[2015/12/11 09:21:28] <head8debian> jesusalva: You can though. :D
[2015/12/11 09:22:39] <jesusalva> -figlet 9 days!

[2015/12/11 10:39:50] <head8debian> leyyin: I still don't know what a commie is.

[2015/12/11 10:58:25] <leyyin> why not ;)
[2015/12/11 10:58:26] <brmbrmcar> I promised I'd stop.
[2015/12/11 11:00:20] <brmbrmcar> But in Europe, you can go around without fear of guns in the wrong hands! Amazing!
[2015/12/11 11:00:47] <head8debian> I have more fear of them being in the wrong hands over there.
[2015/12/11 11:00:59] <leyyin> 'them' ?
[2015/12/11 11:01:00] <brmbrmcar> Yes. Exactly.
[2015/12/11 11:01:19] <brmbrmcar> You are missing out in the lack of guns.
[2015/12/11 11:01:43] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Me and leyyin were just talkign about that...
[2015/12/11 11:01:58] <brmbrmcar> Really?
[2015/12/11 11:02:06] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: So, do you think that guns shoudl be banned completely, or let people have the freely?
[2015/12/11 11:02:08] <leyyin> who is 'them' ?
[2015/12/11 11:02:09] <brmbrmcar> I'll re-check the trees.
[2015/12/11 11:02:16] <brmbrmcar> I hate guns.
[2015/12/11 11:02:20] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: It was in #stk...
[2015/12/11 11:02:23] <brmbrmcar> They are useless.
[2015/12/11 11:02:39] <leyyin> head8debian, you know there is a middle ground, not black and white ;)
[2015/12/11 11:03:24] <head8debian> bbl.
[2015/12/11 11:05:13] <Tobbi> head8debian: I think we'd be annoyed if we met each other in person, but maybe if we accept donations...
[2015/12/11 11:05:59] <brmbrmcar> Why aren't there donations?
[2015/12/11 11:06:04] <brmbrmcar> Oh,yeah.
[2015/12/11 11:06:11] <head8debian> Tobbi: :-)
[2015/12/11 11:06:39] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: We have no one who want to accept the responsability to take care of it.

[2015/12/11 11:08:17] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: No one does.
[2015/12/11 11:08:26] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: We have no need for money either.
[2015/12/11 11:08:50] <head8debian> Unless we are going to hire a part time dev to replace Tobbi...
[2015/12/11 11:08:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/11 11:09:18] <head8debian> Tobbi: That was the exact response i was expecting. :D
[2015/12/11 11:09:27] <Tobbi> head8debian: No one can replace me.
[2015/12/11 11:09:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: I know you too well... :p
[2015/12/11 11:09:35] <Tobbi> You know that sign that is hanging above my bed.

[2015/12/11 11:09:43] <head8debian> Huh?
[2015/12/11 11:10:16] <brmbrmcar> How much do you pay?
[2015/12/11 11:10:25] <Tobbi> head8debian: "complains about me are most likely the sign that there's something wrong with the person having problems with me"
[2015/12/11 11:10:27] <brmbrmcar> I wanna 8 figure salary.
[2015/12/11 11:11:37] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: I want enough to pretty comfortably live off of, but i don't want to work my butt off in the proccess...
[2015/12/11 11:12:07] <brmbrmcar> Yeah.
[2015/12/11 11:12:35] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: When i raise a family i'd like to spend time with them, not be gone all the time.
[2015/12/11 11:12:37] <brmbrmcar> I want enough dosh for another computer.
[2015/12/11 11:12:43] <brmbrmcar> Yeah.

[2015/12/11 11:13:27] <brmbrmcar> Nah.
[2015/12/11 11:13:36] <brmbrmcar> This is fast enough.

[2015/12/11 11:14:12] <brmbrmcar> That's what I want, not what I've got.
[2015/12/11 11:14:31] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: It would be better than a chromebook.
[2015/12/11 11:14:58] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/12/11 11:14:58] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: 250gb HDD, 4gb ram, dual core 1.86ghz c2d.
[2015/12/11 11:15:27] <brmbrmcar> Mine has less ram but more proccessing.
[2015/12/11 11:15:44] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: What proccessor?
[2015/12/11 11:15:51] <brmbrmcar> And also, Chromebooks just turn out faster than devices of a similay spec.
[2015/12/11 11:16:00] <brmbrmcar> I have 2.4ghzintel.

[2015/12/11 12:27:45] <jesusalva> (or hadn't)
[2015/12/11 12:27:55] <jesusalva> I have no idea of what this exactly is about...
[2015/12/11 12:28:08] <brmbrmcar> Come on, broken microphone, perfectly good computer, 0.5 bitcoins.
[2015/12/11 12:28:33] <jesusalva> head8debian: In what else would you spend money, head8debian, which is not food or ways to do more money to buy more food?
[2015/12/11 12:29:02] <jesusalva> As bible says... "Why do [...] you spend your money on what is not bread [food]?"
[2015/12/11 12:29:20] <brmbrmcar> What about liquid?
[2015/12/11 12:29:41] <jesusalva> brmbrmcar: If the microphone is broken, then the good computer is not perfectly.
[2015/12/11 12:29:47] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2015/12/11 12:30:02] <brmbrmcar> So 0.49 bitoins?
[2015/12/11 12:30:47] * jesusalva needs to do physical exercises.
[2015/12/11 12:30:59] <jesusalva> But instead, he sits on computer and starts chatting on IRC.
[2015/12/11 12:31:07] <brmbrmcar> 4913 laps of the marathon!
[2015/12/11 12:31:50] <jesusalva> i=0 ; while i >= 4913: { lap() ; i+=1 };
[2015/12/11 12:32:17] <jesusalva> s/>=/<=
[2015/12/11 12:35:07] <brmbrmcar> Correct. I am glad you stuck an equals sign there!
[2015/12/11 12:35:21] <brmbrmcar> i = 4913 laps!!!
[2015/12/11 12:39:54] <jesusalva> so, if i=mc², then a body with mass $brmbrmcar controls time at light resulting in speed 2brmbrmcar, and if there are 2brmbrmcar the cntrols 2 time at 2lights resulting in speed 4brmbrmcar which provokes an ERR_Tobbi...
[2015/12/11 12:41:00] <jesusalva> Which invokes a SIGSEGV and the time crashes. Only the space is left, but with no time, there is no speed, with no speed, there is no brmbrmcar, and if no brmbrmcar, the timespace layer collapses and only Tobbi remains.
[2015/12/11 12:41:09] <jesusalva> See? Einsten's formula.
[2015/12/11 12:42:20] <brmbrmcar> Nice.

[2015/12/11 12:44:32] <brmbrmcar> For working out your exercise.
[2015/12/11 12:47:00] <brmbrmcar> Mass in kg*energy in Kcal daily/(4913/running speed in kmh)=time running needed to recover.
[2015/12/11 12:47:28] <brmbrmcar> It currently only works for running, but I imagine swimming would be similar.
[2015/12/11 12:48:53] <brmbrmcar> In a week.
[2015/12/11 12:49:52] <jesusalva> Hm. 40*2000/(4913/4) = 80000/1228.25 = 65.13 h * kg * kcal/km
[2015/12/11 12:50:11] <jesusalva> So I take 65.13 brmbrmcars to recover. Am I correct?
[2015/12/11 12:50:48] <jesusalva> Time mass and energy / space. Or Eisten's formula/space.
[2015/12/11 12:51:26] <jesusalva> ...Using previous formula, the final result is [brmbrmcar/Tobbi] ?
[2015/12/11 12:51:31] <brmbrmcar> Ooh.
[2015/12/11 12:51:36] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2015/12/11 12:51:44] <brmbrmcar> Traffic!!!
[2015/12/11 12:53:16] <brmbrmcar> What is your favourite excercise?
[2015/12/11 12:59:42] <jesusalva> ...Typing and thinking. I'm thinking. I was thinking. Still thinking. When thinking is stopped, the person has gone mad or dead.

[2015/12/11 13:06:23] <brmbrmcar> So multiply the rusult of my formula by 100.
[2015/12/11 13:10:28] <jesusalva> 65133.32 brmbrmcars.
[2015/12/11 13:10:29] <brmbrmcar> It may just be impossible to fit it in one week for you.
[2015/12/11 13:10:47] <brmbrmcar> Sochoose something better.

[2015/12/12 10:55:06] <LeFire> Hey guys, I was trying to get a levels checkpoints, but I'm having some difficulty understanding how the classes correlate
[2015/12/12 10:56:25] <Hume2> Checkpoints or spawnpoint?
[2015/12/12 10:56:51] <LeFire> That's the thing, I might be confusing it
[2015/12/12 10:57:06] <LeFire> Checkpoints though, I think
[2015/12/12 10:57:13] <Hume2> If you mean the bell, it's the reset point thing.
[2015/12/12 10:57:32] <LeFire> yeah, I was able to get the last reset point
[2015/12/12 10:57:39] <LeFire> I am trying to get the next one though
[2015/12/12 10:57:50] <Hume2> So put another one.
[2015/12/12 10:58:34] <Hume2> What's the problem?
[2015/12/12 10:58:53] <LeFire> I mean, I'm trying to get the next available one :b
[2015/12/12 10:59:28] <mt> https://ptpb.pw/Mc6U.png <-- the dead bouncing snowball, is that supposed to happen when it's hit by a fireball?
[2015/12/12 10:59:44] <brmbrmcar> Git the levelgoing.
[2015/12/12 11:00:19] <Hume2> mt: never tried that.

[2015/12/12 11:01:22] <brmbrmcar> What do ypu want me to actually test>
[2015/12/12 11:01:36] <Hume2> LeFire: How a checkpoint can't work?
[2015/12/12 11:02:09] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Just the level.
[2015/12/12 11:02:11] <LeFire> I want to get the coordinates of the next checkpoint I haven't reached
[2015/12/12 11:02:33] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/12 11:02:48] <Hume2> LeFire: So click on it and the coordinates should reveal.
[2015/12/12 11:02:49] <brmbrmcar> It's pretty good onfirst impressions...
[2015/12/12 11:03:33] <LeFire> Humer2: on code, not while playing :b
[2015/12/12 11:04:37] <Hume2> LeFire: On code it's super easy. You just find where the checkpoint has saved.
[2015/12/12 11:04:52] <Hume2> Don't be confused, it saves as "firefly".
[2015/12/12 11:05:39] <brmbrmcar> I don'tlike the way that badguys are in a jumping blindspot.
[2015/12/12 11:06:00] <LeFire> Oh, so it's the firefly x)
[2015/12/12 11:06:02] <LeFire> Thanks
[2015/12/12 11:07:20] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Unfortunatelly, we have no badguys those can move properly in such terrain.
[2015/12/12 11:07:58] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/12 11:08:35] <Hume2> There's an easter egg in this level. Can you find it?

[2015/12/12 16:57:24] <joserebelo> Hey all
[2015/12/12 16:57:29] <Not-e81f> [02supertux] 03Success. AppVeyor build succeeded - 13https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maths22/supertux-9ml4d/build/111
[2015/12/12 16:57:46] <joserebelo> The builds on travis are failing because of something on an openssl command
[2015/12/12 16:57:51] <joserebelo> any idea why ?
[2015/12/12 16:58:34] <pedromlcosta> Yeah, we made a pull request with a console script, but it failed.
[2015/12/12 17:02:25] <brmbrmcar> What script?
[2015/12/12 17:02:36] <pedromlcosta> A warp
[2015/12/12 17:02:52] <brmbrmcar> OK, I am confused.
[2015/12/12 17:03:02] <pedromlcosta> the script is called warp, moves Tux X and Y blocks away from where he is
[2015/12/12 17:03:14] <pedromlcosta> and can be called on the console using warp(x, y)
[2015/12/12 17:03:20] <brmbrmcar> functions(...) didn't work.
[2015/12/12 17:03:38] <joserebelo> i read your message, but Tobbi had merged it already
[2015/12/12 17:03:39] <brmbrmcar> How do you use warp(x,y)?
[2015/12/12 17:03:44] <joserebelo> it works here
[2015/12/12 17:03:44] <Tobbi> Hello.
[2015/12/12 17:03:49] <Tobbi> What have I done?
[2015/12/12 17:04:13] <joserebelo> nothing
[2015/12/12 17:04:36] <joserebelo> but the thing is, the travis builds are failing, it has nothing to do with the code changes
[2015/12/12 17:05:50] <brmbrmcar> I'll check out console.nut,
[2015/12/12 17:06:54] <brmbrmcar> So, it is nothing to do with the actual Consl.
[2015/12/12 17:07:06] <joserebelo> ?
[2015/12/12 17:08:13] <brmbrmcar> I mean,it is simpleadd to functions.
[2015/12/12 17:08:32] <pedromlcosta> yeah, we added a function there
[2015/12/12 17:08:35] <pedromlcosta> it works here
[2015/12/12 17:08:43] <brmbrmcar> So it is not affecting the actual Console scripting itself.
[2015/12/12 17:08:47] <pedromlcosta> No
[2015/12/12 17:09:05] <pedromlcosta> We just made the wrapper and added a function in functions.cpp
[2015/12/12 17:09:05] <brmbrmcar> I mean, it is a script, but nothing in the actual console changed.
[2015/12/12 17:09:10] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/12/12 17:09:19] <brmbrmcar> So Console is not involved.
[2015/12/12 17:10:13] <pedromlcosta> Yeah, it isnt. I just call the warp function there, as I would  any script :b
[2015/12/12 17:10:16] <brmbrmcar> I confused myself there...
[2015/12/12 17:10:46] <brmbrmcar> I doubt it'll be merged before 0.4.0.
[2015/12/12 17:11:37] <pedromlcosta> Np, we just needed that it passed and was accepted, for a college/university class we're doing :b
[2015/12/12 17:13:20] <brmbrmcar> I wish it was merged though.
[2015/12/12 17:13:46] <joserebelo> but the travis build didn't fail bcuz of us
[2015/12/12 17:14:05] <joserebelo> the problem isn't related to the code
[2015/12/12 17:15:05] <brmbrmcar> If I hadmy way it would be merged.

[2015/12/12 17:15:26] <brmbrmcar> It isn't harming anything else, right?
[2015/12/12 17:15:31] <joserebelo> but do you know why did it fail?
[2015/12/12 17:15:32] <joserebelo> the travis log says
[2015/12/12 17:15:34] <joserebelo> The command "openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_d8a9ffcc8634_key -iv $encrypted_d8a9ffcc8634_iv -in .travis/travis-upload.pem.enc -out .travis/travis-upload.pem -d" failed and exited with 1 during .
[2015/12/12 17:16:40] <brmbrmcar> I wouldn't have a clue.
[2015/12/12 17:16:44] <pedromlcosta> Our AppVeyor passed though
[2015/12/12 17:17:04] <brmbrmcar> I'm not the person toask.
[2015/12/12 17:18:14] <joserebelo> Tobby, do you have any clue on what is happening?

[2015/12/14 10:58:39] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Why would this cause issues?
[2015/12/14 10:59:54] * head8debian is tired...
[2015/12/14 11:00:10] * head8debian is sore...
[2015/12/14 11:01:25] <brmbrmcar> If new stuff was added, and the flowers are clearly handled very differently.
[2015/12/14 11:02:02] <brmbrmcar> I think it is a bug in the fireflowers itself, and patching up other areas could lead to hiding it.
[2015/12/14 11:02:22] <Tobbi> head8debian doesn't want to do this anymore.
[2015/12/14 11:02:39] <Tobbi> head8debian is fired.
[2015/12/14 11:02:50] <brmbrmcar> Poor head8debian!

[2015/12/14 11:05:23] <grumbel> Tobbi: All my stuff is for after the release, so you are good to go
[2015/12/14 11:05:33] <Tobbi> Great.
[2015/12/14 11:06:02] <Tobbi> grumbel: And bug-wise? Should be fine, right? I haven't noticed any blockers...
[2015/12/14 11:06:17] <grumbel> no idea, I haven't touched the game in ages
[2015/12/14 11:08:35] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2015/12/14 11:08:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did you notice any blockers while playing the game?
[2015/12/14 11:11:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: I havent. I havent played the game much lately either.
[2015/12/14 11:11:51] <Tobbi> head8debian: You should.
[2015/12/14 11:12:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: We have a release in 6 days.
[2015/12/14 11:12:20] <brmbrmcar> What do you mean by "blockers" anyway?
[2015/12/14 11:15:33] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Big very important bugs that *need* to be fixed.
[2015/12/14 11:15:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ive been outside all day.

[2015/12/14 12:29:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Id like to remember the name of the program a friend recomended to me that would allow you to make any application portable...
[2015/12/14 12:29:53] <head8debian> I cannot remember the name though...
[2015/12/14 12:29:59] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't know either.
[2015/12/14 12:33:17] <mt> Isn't there something like GNOME's "starters"
[2015/12/14 12:33:21] <mt> for Windows
[2015/12/14 12:33:32] <head8debian> mt: Huh>
[2015/12/14 12:33:33] <head8debian> ?
[2015/12/14 12:33:41] <Karkus> Hume2 & Tobbi: I think a portable version would be very useful. It's a pain having to install all the time.
[2015/12/14 12:34:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe what we need to do is ask portableapps.com to update theirs...
[2015/12/14 12:34:12] <brmbrmcar> Which is why I wanted a Linux tar.gz file.
[2015/12/14 12:34:19] <Hume2> SuperTux doesn't need any install on Windows anyway. You can just copy 'n' paste.
[2015/12/14 12:34:30] <mt> head8debian: files that look like an app/program but call another command (possibly with arguments) when you open them
[2015/12/14 12:34:32] <Karkus> Hume2: Huh?
[2015/12/14 12:34:51] <mt> because, I don't really like the idea of promoting any apps that could inject bullshit into SuperTux
[2015/12/14 12:34:56] <Hume2> Karkus: You just copy 'n' paste the compiled SuperTux.
[2015/12/14 12:35:18] <Tobbi> Hume2: That doesn't change the fact that it writes the config to %USERPROFILE%
[2015/12/14 12:35:18] <Karkus> You still have the datadir problem...
[2015/12/14 12:35:21] <Tobbi> which it shouldn't.
[2015/12/14 12:35:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: We can have an option for this.
[2015/12/14 12:35:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: we do.
[2015/12/14 12:35:54] <Tobbi> Karkus: But we need a wrapper that calls supertux with those arguments.
[2015/12/14 12:36:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: I know, but not from within supertux.

[2015/12/14 12:49:45] <Karkus> SuperTux's physics is wrong. Or at least, part of it is. If you jump on a moving platform you get left behind, and fall off the back.
[2015/12/14 12:56:22] <brmbrmcar> It doesn't show inertia.
[2015/12/14 12:57:22] <Karkus> It doesn't account for it, no/
[2015/12/14 12:58:33] <brmbrmcar> Bad.
[2015/12/14 12:58:45] <brmbrmcar> Butthe second you jump, hell!
[2015/12/14 12:59:09] <brmbrmcar> You'd have a bit of forward movement at keast.

[2015/12/14 14:03:08] <Karkus> We will make a huge list after a irc meeting and forum talks etc. then cut that down into a github wiki page to be turned into issues bit by bit.

[2015/12/15 10:43:08] <Tobbi> I just hope that people won't find it too difficult to install language packs.
[2015/12/15 10:43:18] <Tobbi> I *hope* that this won't be overlooked.
[2015/12/15 10:43:48] <Tobbi> People might assume that since the game is already translated, they don't need to install language packs.
[2015/12/15 10:44:09] <jesusalva> Exactly.
[2015/12/15 10:44:10] <maths22> Tobbi: We need to add clearer documentation that language packs are for translating addons
[2015/12/15 10:44:20] <maths22> I don't think that that is currently obvious
[2015/12/15 10:44:21] <Tobbi> maths22: Yeah, but where?
[2015/12/15 10:44:29] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Distros will compile supertux for their repos once 4.0 is released.
[2015/12/15 10:44:36] <maths22> Tobbi: I have no idea
[2015/12/15 10:44:41] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/12/15 10:44:45] <maths22> I was hoping someone else had a good idea
[2015/12/15 10:45:02] <Tobbi> maths22: I mean: We could package po files with each individual add-on.
[2015/12/15 10:45:05] <Tobbi> That woud work.
[2015/12/15 10:45:53] <Tobbi> I believe it's even supported by the game.
[2015/12/15 10:47:24] <brmbrmcar> Do you think there should be target times on more levels?
[2015/12/15 10:49:12] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Not for now. We can revisit the idea once the release is done.

[2015/12/15 11:06:35] <maths22_> Apparently the server issue is actually an ISP issue.

[2015/12/15 11:07:46] <leyyin> do they want independence?
[2015/12/15 11:07:57] <Tobbi> leyyin: They are independent. We deny their existence.

[2015/12/15 11:17:55] <maths22> Tobbi: ISP issues, such that the server had no internet connection
[2015/12/15 11:18:04] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2015/12/15 11:18:17] <Tobbi> You told me this, before, didn't you? :D I suck at remembering things.
[2015/12/15 11:18:36] <maths22> The person who runs the server told me he's planning to switch ISPs soon (These sorts of things have happened too often)
[2015/12/15 11:18:42] <maths22> Tobbi: and yes, I did already say this
[2015/12/15 11:18:55] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/12/15 11:55:42] <Tobbi> I never actually agreed to be the maintainer.
[2015/12/15 11:55:49] <alket> lets drop c++ and do it in godotengine xD

[2015/12/15 13:02:28] <brmbrmcar> What the hell is wrong with it?
[2015/12/15 13:02:35] <brmbrmcar> It has tonnes of features!
[2015/12/15 13:02:51] <brmbrmcar> Way,way better than pastebin.com!
[2015/12/15 13:05:24] <Karkus> The problem with your level is that it's not particularly fun. You've got lots of features, but it's just plain difficult
[2015/12/15 13:05:54] <brmbrmcar> I thought it was much easier than  a lot of levels in IncubaterIsland.
[2015/12/15 13:06:04] <brmbrmcar> But where could it be made esier?

[2015/12/15 15:44:15] <maths22> We wouldn't publish any offical releases until Sunday, but that way if any of the builds have issues or something else doesn't work, we have a chance to fix it
[2015/12/15 15:44:25] <Tobbi> maths22: You want to iron out issues after the code freeze? Won't people assume they have to build off the tagged SHA1?

[2015/12/15 15:45:30] <maths22> Tobbi: let me re-state that: code freeze, check builds, then tag and check those builds
[2015/12/15 15:45:43] <Tobbi> maths22: Okay, that sounds fine with me.
[2015/12/15 15:45:53] <Tobbi> Right. Builds...
[2015/12/15 15:45:54] <Tobbi> Not code :D
[2015/12/15 15:45:59] <maths22> The second set should only be issues in the build system, and won't require any new code

[2015/12/15 16:09:23] <Poino> will there be an editor for the next release (stable) of SuperTux?
[2015/12/15 16:09:41] <Tobbi> Poino: Editor is still in the making. Karkus and I are working on something based on Python.
[2015/12/15 16:09:50] <Tobbi> Poino: Unfortunately we couldn't make it for 0.4.0
[2015/12/15 16:10:04] <brmbrmcar> here will be an integrated one in  0.4.1 hopefully.
[2015/12/15 16:10:12] <Poino> :D
[2015/12/15 16:10:16] <Tobbi> Yes, with less features than the python one obviously.
[2015/12/15 16:10:21] <Poino> At least you're making it
[2015/12/15 16:10:28] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/12/15 16:10:33] <Tobbi> Poino: Ever used the old one?
[2015/12/15 16:10:43] <Poino> The one from milestone 1
[2015/12/15 16:10:45] <Poino> ¿?
[2015/12/15 16:10:52] <brmbrmcar> No, the mono one.
[2015/12/15 16:10:53] <Tobbi> Poino: There's a C# editor as well.
[2015/12/15 16:10:56] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/12/15 16:11:11] <brmbrmcar> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux-editor
[2015/12/15 16:11:29] <Poino> thx
[2015/12/15 16:11:38] <brmbrmcar> I prefer that one.
[2015/12/15 16:11:39] <Tobbi> Poino: It's quite tedious to setup...
[2015/12/15 16:11:52] <Poino> i realise
[2015/12/15 16:11:52] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Because the new one doesn't have all the features...
[2015/12/15 16:11:54] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/15 16:12:02] <Tobbi> (yet)
[2015/12/15 16:12:15] <brmbrmcar> PersonallyI wish it was still in development, but it was extremelybuggy on some systems.
[2015/12/15 16:12:30] <brmbrmcar> Soon Flexlay will bemuch better.
[2015/12/15 16:12:34] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: It needs mono + gtk\
[2015/12/15 16:12:36] <Tobbi> #
[2015/12/15 16:12:41] <Poino> And what will the new editor will have?
[2015/12/15 16:12:42] <Tobbi> plus some magic.
[2015/12/15 16:12:56] <Tobbi> Poino: at some point it will have all the features of the old one.
[2015/12/15 16:13:00] <Tobbi> Based on python and everything.
[2015/12/15 16:13:22] <Poino> Interesting
[2015/12/15 16:13:22] <brmbrmcar> There's a really good ppa for the C~ one.
[2015/12/15 16:13:30] <brmbrmcar> For Ubuntu.
[2015/12/15 16:13:36] <Tobbi> Poino: If you know Python, you can help ;)
[2015/12/15 16:13:45] <brmbrmcar> Which is how I got that editor.
[2015/12/15 16:13:48] <Poino> I know nothing at all :P

[2015/12/15 16:14:01] <Poino> e.e
[2015/12/15 16:14:24] <Tobbi> But when I say "I don't know anything about computers", people get mad at me.
[2015/12/15 16:14:37] <brmbrmcar> I don't know any Python.
[2015/12/15 16:14:44] <leyyin> You are like the John Snow of computers Tobbi
[2015/12/15 16:14:56] <brmbrmcar> I mean, I could learn it quickly, when seeing it.
[2015/12/15 16:15:14] <brmbrmcar> I dn't really know C either, but I can use it.
[2015/12/15 16:15:16] <Tobbi> leyyin: Do you have a ping on "I don't know anything about computers"?
