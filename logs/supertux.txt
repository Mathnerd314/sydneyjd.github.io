[2015/11/06 11:42:45] <brmbrmcar> There is no advanced HTML needed.
[2015/11/06 11:43:10] <head8debian> Karkus: its hacked together. i have crontab execute a cp command, then i have it execute a git commit and push command and i have a ssh key set up between github and my server.
[2015/11/06 11:43:23] <head8debian> Karkus: Currently it only gets dumped to 1 file.
[2015/11/06 11:43:32] <head8debian> And my website is thrown together...

[2015/11/06 11:44:55] <head8debian> I could do more...
[2015/11/06 11:46:05] <head8debian> There, now its 5 times a day... that should be better.
[2015/11/06 11:46:12] <head8debian> I really don't want to do more than that.

[2015/11/06 12:15:31] <maths22> I'm working on importing my logs from irssi, and then I will try to make a better front-end

[2015/11/06 12:16:23] <maths22> Karkus: not sure, but the really nice thing about it is that, once I finish making my script, it will be really easy to import logs from irrsi if the logserver goes down

[2015/11/06 17:02:05] <leyyin> btw, I used the travis file from supertux for the stk-editor ;)
[2015/11/06 17:02:12] <leyyin> without proper reference

[2015/11/06 17:05:30] <Karkus> Sorry
[2015/11/06 17:05:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's alright. I am not mean.
[2015/11/06 17:05:36] <Tobbi> I am evil.
[2015/11/06 17:06:00] <leyyin> Tobbi, if you are evil then I am Stalin
[2015/11/06 17:06:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: I think you should stick to torturing babies
[2015/11/06 17:06:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, yeah, we need to devise a new method...
[2015/11/06 17:06:26] <Karkus> Okay that has no context
[2015/11/06 17:06:28] <Tobbi> What about those wind turbines...

[2015/11/06 17:06:35] <Tobbi> We could couple them with cherry cake.

[2015/11/06 17:07:23] <Tobbi> leyyin: We never talked about literally torturing babies.
[2015/11/06 17:07:34] <leyyin> you live in Germany man
[2015/11/06 17:07:40] <Tobbi> And, for the most part, no one of us has ever tortured a baby.
[2015/11/06 17:07:49] <leyyin> they arrest you just for wearing an indian sign ;)
[2015/11/06 17:07:57] <red_bot> Tobbi: sure... your talking about putting 1 baby in 3 trach cans...
[2015/11/06 17:07:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: Speak for yourself :D
[2015/11/06 17:07:58] <Tobbi> leyyin: *cough*
[2015/11/06 17:08:06] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/11/06 17:08:14] <red_bot> Tobbi: According to my perfect logs...
[2015/11/06 17:08:24] <Tobbi> That's the exception. If you believe in Buddhism, it's not actually killing if the baby gets reborn.
[2015/11/06 17:08:38] <Karkus> There are advantages to not having logs too, I guess
[2015/11/06 17:08:42] <Tobbi> Wait, Buddhism, Hinduism, right?
[2015/11/06 17:08:53] <head8debian> Karkus: Haha, true.

[2015/11/06 17:26:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh c'mon...

[2015/11/06 17:33:12] <brmbrmcar> It is the United Kingdom!

[2015/11/06 17:35:08] <brmbrmcar> Why?
[2015/11/06 17:35:43] <Karkus> Why what?
[2015/11/06 17:36:07] <brmbrmcar> Do you not want NI or Wales?
[2015/11/06 17:36:43] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Where do you live?

[2015/11/06 17:37:21] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/06 17:37:26] <Karkus> and Wales, well idk I can't understand them

[2015/11/06 18:01:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: It was speculated a while ago that swimming could be implemented in supertux. Could that be a 0.5.0 thing or is it not possible due the amount of levels that rely on you being unable to swim?
[2015/11/06 18:01:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could certainly put it in the 0.5.0 release list.
[2015/11/06 18:01:39] <Tobbi> eeh, todo list.
[2015/11/06 18:01:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Which is where?
[2015/11/06 18:01:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: not yet created.
[2015/11/06 18:02:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: file a bug report.

[2015/11/06 18:02:15] <Karkus> okay
[2015/11/06 18:02:29] <Tobbi> We'd have to go through the list of levels to see which of these use water...

[2015/11/06 18:04:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe a lot of levels require you to be unable to swim... But maybe we could add a special bonus item.

[2015/11/06 18:13:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: that would be cool. :D What kind of item do you think should give tux the ability to swim?
[2015/11/06 18:13:52] <Tobbi> Because otherwise, we'd have to rework a lot of levels.
[2015/11/06 18:14:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: Flippers would be a kinda funny one
[2015/11/06 18:14:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Penguins are pretty epic at swimming anyway :P
[2015/11/06 18:14:34] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/11/06 18:15:13] <Tobbi> oh, wait. Water has never really been solid.
[2015/11/06 18:15:26] <Tobbi> So, we don't need a special item for tht
[2015/11/06 18:15:27] <Tobbi> that
[2015/11/06 18:15:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: How about this for music: https://soundcloud.com/karkus476/water-theme? Please be honest if it's bad. it's a proof of concept unfinished thing
[2015/11/06 18:16:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: we do, as many levels have water that, if you could swim in it, would make the level easy
[2015/11/06 18:16:29] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2015/11/06 18:16:33] <Tobbi> hah, confusion.
[2015/11/06 18:16:41] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, that theme plays when Tux swims?
[2015/11/06 18:16:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, in underwater levels
[2015/11/06 18:16:59] <Tobbi> Ah...
[2015/11/06 18:17:03] <Tobbi> Hmm, interesting.
[2015/11/06 18:17:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: In my opinion, it needs a more mysterious touch.
[2015/11/06 18:17:37] <Tobbi> Or?
[2015/11/06 18:17:39] <Tobbi> Let me check something.
[2015/11/06 18:17:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah, I see.
[2015/11/06 18:20:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Check what?

[2015/11/06 18:20:30] <Tobbi> Do you know Fish Fillets - Next Generation.
[2015/11/06 18:20:33] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/11/06 18:20:42] <Tobbi> The music doesn't fit well, either.
[2015/11/06 18:21:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't know it
[2015/11/06 18:21:27] <Tobbi> okay.
[2015/11/06 18:21:41] <Karkus> And which music doesn't fit well?
[2015/11/06 18:21:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: The one I linked to, above.
[2015/11/06 18:21:59] <Karkus> Oh, okay
[2015/11/06 18:22:18] <Tobbi> We need something funky, but something that is mysterious at the same time, and "underwater". :P
[2015/11/06 18:22:50] <Tobbi> On the other hand.
[2015/11/06 18:22:56] <Karkus> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xelag0YVrcs
[2015/11/06 18:22:59] <Tobbi> I just checked mario's underwater theme...
[2015/11/06 18:23:05] <Karkus> Ah
[2015/11/06 18:23:43] <Tobbi> Okay, so maybe I was too strict there :D
[2015/11/06 18:24:23] <Karkus> I get what you mean.
[2015/11/06 18:24:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could have music blocks... Things that play a certain note when you hit them :D
[2015/11/06 18:24:55] <Tobbi> And people could play around with that then :D
[2015/11/06 18:25:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: But we need a good editor :P
[2015/11/06 18:25:20] <Tobbi> *sigh* yeah, you're right :D
[2015/11/06 18:25:21] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/11/06 18:25:27] <Tobbi> That prerequisite...
[2015/11/06 18:25:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Add it to the list
[2015/11/06 18:25:42] <Tobbi> Not sure if I should or how much fun that would be :D
[2015/11/06 18:26:48] <Karkus> Tobbi: Once I've done this controls thing I'll see what I can do for the editor.
[2015/11/06 18:26:56] <Tobbi> Alright, thanks
[2015/11/06 18:26:57] <Tobbi> !
[2015/11/06 18:27:14] <Karkus> I wish Grumbel had just commented his code in the first place
[2015/11/06 18:27:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do many OS projects have documentation?
[2015/11/06 18:28:10] <Tobbi> Hmm, that's a thing I don't know. I don't normally follow that many open source projects.
[2015/11/06 18:28:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/06 18:28:26] <Karkus> I doubt it though
[2015/11/06 18:30:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: on the other hand, levels based on music will likely be hard for the hearing impaired.
[2015/11/06 18:30:26] <Tobbi> So maybe we shouldn't develop that idea further...
[2015/11/06 18:31:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: We should have a braile version of the wiki
[2015/11/06 18:31:32] <Karkus> jk :D
[2015/11/06 18:31:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: We could have subtitles
[2015/11/06 18:31:49] <Karkus> If you *really* want
[2015/11/06 18:32:04] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:32:08] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2015/11/06 18:32:23] <Tobbi> How would a music level actually look like anyway?
[2015/11/06 18:32:24] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:33:00] <Tobbi> But, yeah, braille...
[2015/11/06 18:33:01] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:33:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: But, yeah, braille, no :P
[2015/11/06 18:33:47] <datahead8888> A music based level would probably have differet notes or snippets of music play at different points that cue the player in to actions.  For visual look you could have staffs and/or notes.
[2015/11/06 18:34:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: What program did you use to compose the music?
[2015/11/06 18:34:13] <datahead8888> For the hearing impaired you would have to have text that allows them to get the hints without auditory cues.
[2015/11/06 18:34:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: Musescore
[2015/11/06 18:34:24] <Tobbi> Sounds interesting.
[2015/11/06 18:34:49] <datahead8888> Now, programming levels for the blind would be interesting.  You would need auditory cues that allow them to play in a "dark level" so as to speak
[2015/11/06 18:34:53] <Karkus> You can probably already script sounds in anyway
[2015/11/06 18:35:13] <Karkus> Echo location supertux, anyone?
[2015/11/06 18:35:21] <datahead8888> Oh, that's a good idea
[2015/11/06 18:35:32] <datahead8888> It would make an interesting challenge for people who see, too
[2015/11/06 18:35:47] <datahead8888> It would probably have to be a slow moving level
[2015/11/06 18:36:04] <datahead8888> You wouldn't want enemies that move fast and dive bomb the player in something like that :)
[2015/11/06 18:36:16] <Tobbi> Create issues, guys.
[2015/11/06 18:36:17] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:36:19] <Karkus> datahead8888: A pit would be hard enough
[2015/11/06 18:36:29] <Tobbi> Interesting thing for post 0.4.0
[2015/11/06 18:36:45] <Karkus> Everything is interesting when it's post 0.4.0 :D
[2015/11/06 18:36:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:37:19] <datahead8888> I've suggested some of this kind of stuff for Secret Chronicles before - it's all a matter of priorities
[2015/11/06 18:37:24] <datahead8888> But if you want, I could file some issues
[2015/11/06 18:38:27] <datahead8888> While you're at it, it's good to think about disability accessibility for the whole game
[2015/11/06 18:38:32] <datahead8888> What if you have a color blind player?
[2015/11/06 18:38:54] <datahead8888> Or have tones in other parts of the game
[2015/11/06 18:39:22] <Tobbi> But it's hard for colour blind people, anyway.
[2015/11/06 18:39:28] <Tobbi> Unless we filter everything in specific colours/
[2015/11/06 18:39:46] <datahead8888> Well, you'd probably focus on critical items they have to differentiate.
[2015/11/06 18:40:12] <datahead8888> It might be a bit challenging to do unless you can find a color blind volunteer to check out the game
[2015/11/06 18:42:45] <Karkus> datahead8debian: Colour blindness does not affect people that much
[2015/11/06 18:43:09] <Karkus> It's not like black and white, and supertux doesn't need colours to fucntion
[2015/11/06 18:44:00] <datahead8888> If you had text without good contrast it could become an issue
[2015/11/06 18:45:13] <Karkus> datahead8888: I guess. Maybe.
[2015/11/06 18:45:29] <datahead8888> It might not be an issue at all now, though

[2015/11/07 10:21:38] <leyyin> higher dpi
[2015/11/07 10:22:31] <Hume2> What do they expect? I don't want to see what's on my computer via a microscope.
[2015/11/07 10:22:45] <head8debian> What i have works fine.
[2015/11/07 10:22:48] <leyyin> you can see the diference man ;)
[2015/11/07 10:22:54] <leyyin> higher quality
[2015/11/07 10:22:58] <leyyin> more sharp
[2015/11/07 10:23:00] <head8debian> Yes i can, ive seen a 4k screen.
[2015/11/07 10:23:05] <leyyin> it's like looking out of a window
[2015/11/07 10:23:09] <head8debian> But my wallet cringes. :D
[2015/11/07 10:23:18] <head8debian> And i only get new when my old breaks.

[2015/11/07 10:24:11] <head8debian> Hey, im still using a 15in 1024x768px screen. :)
[2015/11/07 10:24:29] <leyyin> that is a weird resolution
[2015/11/07 10:24:36] <Hume2> I'm using 1536Ã768 screen.
[2015/11/07 10:24:48] <leyyin> are you sure it is not 1366? Hume2
[2015/11/07 10:25:03] <head8debian> My main screen is 1600x900.
[2015/11/07 10:25:22] <Hume2> leyyin: Yes, that's right.
[2015/11/07 10:25:28] <Hume2> leyyin: 1366
[2015/11/07 10:25:35] <Hume2> it is.
[2015/11/07 10:25:42] <head8debian> Only 11954 hours on it. :D
[2015/11/07 10:25:56] <leyyin> how can you tell? head8debian
[2015/11/07 10:26:14] <head8debian> My screen has a menu which tells me...

[2015/11/07 10:26:42] <leyyin> what?
[2015/11/07 10:26:50] <leyyin> what crappy tractors do you have?
[2015/11/07 10:26:57] <leyyin> I have seen tractors old as 40 years
[2015/11/07 10:26:59] <leyyin> still running
[2015/11/07 10:27:07] <head8debian> Only 40? :)
[2015/11/07 10:27:40] <head8debian> My grandpa has one from when he was 12 thats still running. :) And he is 80.
[2015/11/07 10:27:42] <leyyin> how can a tractor not run for 498 days?
[2015/11/07 10:28:08] <head8debian> Tractors don't go by the amount of miles on them, they go by hours on them.
[2015/11/07 10:28:27] <leyyin> what?
[2015/11/07 10:28:27] <head8debian> 6,000 hours on a Combine is alot.
[2015/11/07 10:28:41] <leyyin> how do they measure that?
[2015/11/07 10:29:02] <head8debian> We have a Skytrak with 12,000 hours and its its startign to show its age.
[2015/11/07 10:29:11] <head8debian> leyyin: Every tractor has a time meter...
[2015/11/07 10:29:19] <head8debian> Well, newer ones...
[2015/11/07 10:29:24] <leyyin> I do not think I saw that kind of thing here tbh
[2015/11/07 10:29:27] <head8debian> after 1980. ;)
[2015/11/07 10:30:02] <head8debian> We run relatively modern equipment because of reliabilty reasons and size.
[2015/11/07 10:30:21] <head8debian> Mdern as within the last 20 years.
[2015/11/07 10:30:46] <head8debian> You cannot cover hundreds of acres with a old "put put". :)
[2015/11/07 10:31:04] <head8debian> Wait, your not in the USA, so you wouldn't understand that reference...
[2015/11/07 10:31:16] <head8debian> leyyin: Whats the most popular tractor over ther?
[2015/11/07 10:31:20] <head8debian> there*
[2015/11/07 10:32:17] <mt> The average european is probably not interested in the popularity of tractors...

[2015/11/07 14:22:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: What kind of sponsor do you mean?
[2015/11/07 14:22:49] <Tobbi> Karkus, a VPS, probably? Something we can do automatic nightly builds on.
[2015/11/07 14:23:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: But someone has to pay for it.
[2015/11/07 14:23:25] <Tobbi> Karkus, Not if the company finds the cause worthwhile.
[2015/11/07 14:23:26] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/07 14:23:30] <Karkus> Unless you mean get an actual sponsor of supertux
[2015/11/07 14:23:39] <Tobbi> I mean: We're an open-source projects, we should be able to get someone to pay for the server.
[2015/11/07 14:23:40] <Tobbi> right?
[2015/11/07 14:24:49] <Tobbi> That's something we could need donations for.
[2015/11/07 14:25:19] <mt> With cross-compiling we could also try to get sponsors for this https://www.scaleway.com/pricing/ (don't forget VAT in EU)
[2015/11/07 14:26:58] <Tobbi> mt, Can you ask around?
[2015/11/07 14:27:12] <mt> Not sure who to ask, tbh
[2015/11/07 14:27:28] <Tobbi> mt, I mean: Ask around whether they'd let us set that up for free? We'd of course link back to them from supertux.github.io
[2015/11/07 14:27:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: You could use my server. :D
[2015/11/07 14:27:33] <Tobbi> Could give them some recognition.
[2015/11/07 14:27:38] <Tobbi> head8debian, For cross-compiling?
[2015/11/07 14:27:41] <Tobbi> head8debian, How good is it?
[2015/11/07 14:27:49] <head8debian> Well, not real good.
[2015/11/07 14:27:55] <head8debian> dual core 2.2ghz IIRC.
[2015/11/07 14:28:11] <Tobbi> head8debian, Problem is uploading stuff with your bandwidth.
[2015/11/07 14:28:15] <Tobbi> I believe.
[2015/11/07 14:28:16] <Tobbi> Right?
[2015/11/07 14:28:30] <mt> You'd not need cross-compilation on x86_64 machines, that server I linked to needs it because it's ARM
[2015/11/07 14:28:38] <head8debian> It would take a few mins.
[2015/11/07 14:29:03] <mt> Also, Online SAS is a rather big company, I'd expect more support from smaller hosting companies
[2015/11/07 14:29:09] <head8debian> But i don't care so much about upload speeds. Down is more annoying.

[2015/11/07 14:30:37] <head8debian> It does have 2gb ram.
[2015/11/07 14:30:47] <mt> Because that server's cheaper; you can cross-compile
[2015/11/07 14:31:28] <head8debian> Im not sure if it has ECC ram or non ECC ram.
[2015/11/07 14:31:28] <mt> You know that cross-compiling is for compiling code on an architecture different from the target architecture.
[2015/11/07 14:31:38] <head8debian> Yes i do...
[2015/11/07 14:32:08] <head8debian> But why do we need to cross compile?
[2015/11/07 14:32:20] <Tobbi> So that people from other OSes can get nightly builds as well?
[2015/11/07 14:32:26] <Tobbi> *using other OSes
[2015/11/07 14:32:38] <head8debian> Well, i could see 32 bit and 64 bit, but say x64-86 to ARM?
[2015/11/07 14:32:49] <mt> Nah, because if we'd build natively for ARM no-one could run the builds
[2015/11/07 14:33:22] <mt> If we cross-compile on ARM for x86_64 and i686, then you could run the binaries on "normal" computers
[2015/11/07 14:33:27] <head8debian> I could handle a couple uploads, but not more than 500mb a night.
[2015/11/07 14:34:11] <mt> Also, head8debian, why do you care about ECC? Even most x86_64 basic-level dedicated servers don't have ECC RAM.
[2015/11/07 14:34:31] <Tobbi> head8debian, The binaries shouldn't exceed 500 MB
[2015/11/07 14:34:37] <Tobbi> Maybe 250 in total or something.
[2015/11/07 14:34:39] <head8debian> Because, i could upgrade the ram if its non ECC. ;)
[2015/11/07 14:34:52] <head8debian> I haven't done any looking into the ram it has atm...
[2015/11/07 14:35:07] <head8debian> I got a mobo-cpu-ram combo and just instaleld it and started using it.
[2015/11/07 14:35:18] <mt> That server I linked to is using an ARM SoC, you can't replace RAM on SoCs.
[2015/11/07 14:35:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: But do we really *need* nightly builds?
[2015/11/07 14:35:32] <head8debian> mt: I do know what a SOC is. :)
[2015/11/07 14:35:45] <Tobbi> head8debian, No, we don't. But weekly builds could be neat.
[2015/11/07 14:36:03] <mt> head8debian: Yet you can't send them your RAM to add it.
[2015/11/07 14:36:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: But what if our development goes dead after M2 is released? :)
[2015/11/07 14:36:24] <head8debian> mt: True...
[2015/11/07 14:36:32] <head8debian> But 2gb ram can do quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:36:38] <head8debian> Not alot, but quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:36:57] <mt> As I said, I can build packaged x86_64 Arch Linux binaries manually once every week.
[2015/11/07 14:36:59] <Tobbi> head8debian, It certainly will.
[2015/11/07 14:37:21] <Tobbi> mt, Can't you cross-compile?
[2015/11/07 14:37:37] <head8debian> mt: I can to. :)
[2015/11/07 14:37:41] <mt> Cross-compile for what
[2015/11/07 14:37:47] <head8debian> mt: Arch packages are easy.
[2015/11/07 14:37:51] <Tobbi> mt, Cross-compile for win32 at least?
[2015/11/07 14:38:08] <Tobbi> Mac might be a problem.
[2015/11/07 14:38:09] <mt> Do we even support building using MinGW?
[2015/11/07 14:38:17] <head8debian> mt: I flagged the Supertux AUR package out of date, but haven't heard back. I even linked them to a updated version of it.
[2015/11/07 14:38:18] <Tobbi> afaik, we do.
[2015/11/07 14:38:55] <head8debian> Well, i would have more ram free if red_bot wasn't taking 250mb. o_O
[2015/11/07 14:38:58] <Tobbi> http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Building_on_Windows says we do with MSYS and MinGW
[2015/11/07 14:39:01] * head8debian stares at red_bot...
[2015/11/07 14:39:11] <Tobbi> red_bot stares back and wonders...
[2015/11/07 14:39:16] <Tobbi> Okay, guys, see you later.
[2015/11/07 14:39:21] <Tobbi> or rather in a minute.

[2015/11/07 14:39:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: The only thing with building is that my CPU fan is noisy. :D
[2015/11/07 14:40:22] <mt> I know that, I have so many computers I could use as homeservers, but they're too noisy

[2015/11/07 14:41:51] <Tobbi_> This project's activity has gone up quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:42:43] <head8debian> mt: my server is the last computer i use currently thats noisy, thankfully. ;)
[2015/11/07 14:43:08] <mt> but: more activity -> more bugs -> more activity -> even more bugs -> /* repeat */ :(
[2015/11/07 14:43:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, i do have another computer that we could use for this... but i don't want to. Then my room would be super really noisy. :p
[2015/11/07 14:43:40] <head8debian> mt: True... but you cannot just live with bugs.
[2015/11/07 14:43:46] <Karkus> mt: But more people to fix bugs

[2015/11/07 14:44:21] <head8debian> Its a loop...
[2015/11/07 14:44:24] <Tobbi> but also resulting in the project being sustainable.
[2015/11/07 14:44:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: How've you got two unaffiliated quotes
[2015/11/07 14:44:26] <mt> and to introduce as well
[2015/11/07 14:44:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: Uh?
[2015/11/07 14:44:46] <Karkus> Tobbi: Tobbi_ is unaffiliated
[2015/11/07 14:44:52] <Karkus> OOps
[2015/11/07 14:44:53] <Tobbi> mt: Doesn't every big open source project have that problem?
[2015/11/07 14:44:54] <Karkus> cloaks
[2015/11/07 14:44:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: yup.
[2015/11/07 14:45:01] <Karkus> not quotes
[2015/11/07 14:45:03] <mt> Karkus: if you're talking about cloaks, they will always be set when you identify
[2015/11/07 14:45:10] <mt> regardless of the nicknames
[2015/11/07 14:45:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: I have no clue how i'd set up my server to build packages like that though... the upload wouldn't be so hard. My server runs debian btw.
[2015/11/07 14:45:38] <Karkus> mt: But you need to get a cloak for each one, and an account for each one
[2015/11/07 14:45:42] <mt> Tobbi: I guess not just every big open source project, every bigger software project
[2015/11/07 14:45:51] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/11/07 14:45:52] <head8debian> Karkus: No, you group the nicks to your account.
[2015/11/07 14:45:57] <mt> Karkus: nope, you can sign in to the same account multiple times
[2015/11/07 14:46:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: Cronjob?
[2015/11/07 14:46:06] <mt> You don't even need to group nicks
[2015/11/07 14:46:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: Of course cronjob, but like to make a .deb file. ive heard they are a PITB.
[2015/11/07 14:46:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: You mean PITA? Yummy.

[2015/11/07 14:47:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: What OSes would i have to build for?
[2015/11/07 14:47:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Linux and maybe Windows. I believe, OS X is too hard to do.
[2015/11/07 14:47:53] <Karkus> head8debian: Solaris only
[2015/11/07 14:47:58] <Karkus> :D
[2015/11/07 14:48:01] <Tobbi> Solaris? urgh
[2015/11/07 14:48:10] <Karkus> I'm just kidding
[2015/11/07 14:48:19] <head8debian> mt: *should* a debian .deb work with ubuntu if its made properly?
[2015/11/07 14:48:23] <head8debian> Karkus: o_O
[2015/11/07 14:48:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: You'd have to transpile supertux into Java and create one JAR
[2015/11/07 14:48:33] <head8debian> I hate java...
[2015/11/07 14:48:37] <Karkus> head8debian: They do
[2015/11/07 14:48:42] <Tobbi> Java hates you as well.
[2015/11/07 14:48:50] <mt> Solaris, killall python :D
[2015/11/07 14:48:56] <head8debian> I use it as little as possible...
[2015/11/07 14:49:10] <Karkus> I used to like the language Java
[2015/11/07 14:49:22] <Karkus> But it's incredibly frustrating
[2015/11/07 14:49:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: careful...my bachelor thesis program is written in Java.
[2015/11/07 14:49:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: How in the world do you make a windows executable? o_O
[2015/11/07 14:49:45] <Karkus> Correction - I love Java it's the best
[2015/11/07 14:49:49] <mt> head8debian: it might work, but even a proper deb package might not work as ubuntu is not binary compatible to debian
[2015/11/07 14:50:02] <head8debian> I don't even know how to compile 32 bit on 64 bit...
[2015/11/07 14:50:05] <Karkus> head8debian: It's a mystery to everyone
[2015/11/07 14:50:13] <head8debian> lol. :-)
[2015/11/07 14:50:49] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:50:54] <mt> same applies to debian releases, e.g. squeeze, wheezy, jessie and sid, as they use different library versions, which will just break (and yes, I'm adding squeeze to the list because it's still supported)
[2015/11/07 14:51:19] <head8debian> mt: Dont forget stretch... ;)
[2015/11/07 14:51:33] <mt> I don't like testing
[2015/11/07 14:51:50] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/07 14:51:51] <leyyin> Tobbi, I write my bachelor thesis in ocaml ;)

[2015/11/07 14:52:29] <leyyin> secret :P
[2015/11/07 14:52:42] @ Quit: darkbasic: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2015/11/07 14:52:52] <leyyin> conversion from some diagrams to a session logic format, so that it easy to generate code
[2015/11/07 14:53:06] <mt> head8debian: Because it doesn't really get security updates - (old(old))stable gets fast security updates as patches; sid/unstable gets fast security updates from the latest release but testing will have to wait for the package to be in sid for some time and therefore won't get fast security updates
[2015/11/07 14:53:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: Sounds complicated.
[2015/11/07 14:53:27] <leyyin> sounds ;)
[2015/11/07 14:53:34] <Tobbi> hmm okay...
[2015/11/07 14:53:40] <leyyin> everything is simple once you know it :D
[2015/11/07 14:53:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: Believe me, writing a rudimentary transpiler was easy... :P
[2015/11/07 14:54:09] <leyyin> :D
[2015/11/07 14:54:10] <Tobbi> Still, it was torn apart by one of the profs.
[2015/11/07 14:54:11] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:54:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do you get to choose your language?
[2015/11/07 14:54:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: My prof wanted me to use...uh...yacc for that...
[2015/11/07 14:55:00] <leyyin> haha, yacc
[2015/11/07 14:55:02] <Tobbi> Karkus: But he told me something about "Compiler compiler" and I was freaked out.
[2015/11/07 14:55:09] <leyyin> or lex :P
[2015/11/07 14:55:17] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I was like: No way on earth am I gonna use a compiler compiler. I'm gonna write my own thing.
[2015/11/07 14:55:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: O_o
[2015/11/07 14:55:31] <Tobbi> It would've been easier using yacc, I believe.
[2015/11/07 14:55:46] <Tobbi> But, who cares :D
[2015/11/07 14:56:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: What did you use in the end though?
[2015/11/07 14:56:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: I wrote a transpiler in Java.
[2015/11/07 14:56:32] <Karkus> Oh, yeah
[2015/11/07 14:56:34] <Tobbi> That uses a stack and a map.

[2015/11/07 14:56:58] <leyyin> you should have used that ^
[2015/11/07 14:57:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: Uses too much memory.
[2015/11/07 14:57:11] <Tobbi> Also, it's too hairy.
[2015/11/07 14:57:12] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:57:17] <leyyin> I have my last homework for my compilers course to use lex or yacc
[2015/11/07 14:57:22] <Tobbi> I am not a yacc-ophile.

[2015/11/07 14:57:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 15:00:21] <mt> why don't you use bison if you don't like yacc?

[2015/11/07 19:14:05] <Karkus> Who is darkbasic and why do they always quit and join?
[2015/11/07 19:22:34] <head8debian> Karkus: Ask him...
[2015/11/07 19:22:36] <head8debian> ;)
[2015/11/07 19:23:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: one of them quits, the other joins, it's so easy.
[2015/11/07 19:23:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: But why
[2015/11/07 19:23:51] <Karkus> hehe
[2015/11/07 19:24:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: You know those moments when you don't know whether you want to enter a room or leave it and are stuck in the doorframe? This is no different.
[2015/11/07 19:25:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: Silently jumping back and forth through the doorframe...
[2015/11/07 19:25:40] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/11/07 19:26:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's the problem on the big channels like #freenode, so many join/part messages you have no option but to silence them

[2015/11/07 22:15:49] <datahead8888> Tobbi, did you want tickets for the music level or dark level with sound cues ideas?
[2015/11/07 22:16:08] <Tobbi> datahead8888: Yes, please. Whether we implement those is a different thing.
[2015/11/07 22:16:14] <Tobbi> Currently, I am busy with college..
[2015/11/07 22:16:16] <Tobbi> And it's 4am
[2015/11/07 22:16:43] <datahead8888> Okay, I thought you had suggested tickets earlier
[2015/11/07 22:17:10] <datahead8888> I just know that these may stay open for a while, and you guys usually seem to try to get tickets closed quickly, though maybe âI overperceived that
[2015/11/07 22:18:20] <Tobbi> No, it's exactly what we try to do.
[2015/11/07 22:18:32] <head8debian> Hey Tobbi.

[2015/11/08 12:18:51] <mt> please noo
[2015/11/08 12:19:07] <mt> try to make vector images
[2015/11/08 12:19:47] <mt> OS X, for example, uses 1024x1024 for HiDPI when 512x512 would be used
[2015/11/08 12:20:04] <brmbrmcar> But vector is bad...
[2015/11/08 12:20:57] <mt> Why is vector bad?
[2015/11/08 12:21:49] <brmbrmcar> Because it will only really be good within a certain size range.
[2015/11/08 12:21:52] <mt> It's smaller and can be scaled up without limit
[2015/11/08 12:22:05] <head8debian> mt: I do love vectors, but i would need to redo tux from scratch, which i wasnt planning on doing. the bitmap trace tool is still not very good.
[2015/11/08 12:22:25] <head8debian> Cannot .png do something similar?
[2015/11/08 12:22:37] <brmbrmcar> It is useful in enlarging, but should be modified heavily.
[2015/11/08 12:23:07] <mt> brmbrmcar: that's because vector graphics show exactly what you told them. If you don't include details it may look ugly when big.
[2015/11/08 12:23:40] <brmbrmcar> I k-now.
[2015/11/08 12:24:02] <brmbrmcar> I think we should just use the on in the repository.
[2015/11/08 12:24:14] <brmbrmcar> It's way better than any others.

[2015/11/08 12:28:30] <mt> head8debian: you can also try writing the svg in a text editor

[2015/11/08 13:42:42] <brmbrmcar> Use that.
[2015/11/08 13:42:50] <brmbrmcar> Trial it now.
[2015/11/08 13:43:04] <brmbrmcar> I can test it after.
[2015/11/08 14:13:27] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ping!!!!! PING@!
[2015/11/08 14:13:32] <Tobbi> calm down.
[2015/11/08 14:13:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: what?
[2015/11/08 14:13:55] <head8debian> PedroCosta: Feel free to ask Tobbi What you need answers to. :)
[2015/11/08 14:14:05] <brmbrmcar> CTCP PING reply from Tobbi: 0.531 seconds
[2015/11/08 14:14:12] <Tobbi> Stop it.
[2015/11/08 14:14:33] <brmbrmcar> Only did it once!
[2015/11/08 14:15:37] <PedroCosta> Will do!
[2015/11/08 14:15:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: He is talking to me in PM...
[2015/11/08 14:16:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: And he is going to try to talk to you now...

[2015/11/08 14:18:35] <PedroCosta> Trying to do a SuperTux deployment diagram, and wanted to know the kind of connection the PC establishes to get those. And what it connects to (is it a webserver) ?
[2015/11/08 14:18:42] <PedroCosta> the addons and maps
[2015/11/08 14:18:56] <Tobbi> PedroCosta: It's a github repository that gets queried.

[2015/11/09 11:51:22] <Karkus> I managed (by accident) to get a profile with a map messed up like this. But your commit doesn't fix it, it just stops it from occurring
[2015/11/09 11:51:26] <Karkus> Which is better

[2015/11/09 11:53:00] <Tobbi> Yes, but maybe someone else will tell us when it reoccurs.
[2015/11/09 11:53:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: Precisely
[2015/11/09 11:53:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, testing all paths leading to the current position might be the correct way, though that would be much more difficult.

[2015/11/09 12:03:22] <mt> I already described that in the issues tho
[2015/11/09 12:04:11] <mt> That library-version issue is also what can happen when you upgrade systems partially

[2015/11/09 12:15:49] <Tobbi> good
[2015/11/09 12:16:16] <mt> What you described would be possible, but it's not really ok to install the library in a path where the user doesn't want it installed, without confirmation

[2015/11/09 12:18:52] <mt> what can be done to fix the version-related issue is versioning the library in the filename
[2015/11/09 12:18:55] <mt> like:
[2015/11/09 12:18:58] <mt> lrwxrwxrwx 1    24 Nov  2 23:28 /usr/lib/libavformat.so -> libavformat.so.56.40.101*
[2015/11/09 12:18:59] <Karkus> mt: But isn't there a better place that is more universal among the linux distros
[2015/11/09 12:19:00] <mt> lrwxrwxrwx 1    24 Nov  2 23:28 /usr/lib/libavformat.so.56 -> libavformat.so.56.40.101*

[2015/11/09 12:19:47] <mt> the right place would be /lib, but if the user says "install to prefix /a/b/c" then we shouldn't install something somewhere else

[2015/11/09 12:27:24] <Karkus> I'm thinking SuperTree
[2015/11/09 12:27:27] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/09 12:27:58] <Tobbi> SuperVelociraptor.

[2015/11/09 12:28:11] <Tobbi> Or something.

[2015/11/09 12:30:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: The changes I'm making in https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/184 are quickly becoming quite incompatible with the previous version. It's backwards compatible, but not foreward compatible
[2015/11/09 12:30:27] <Karkus> by which I mean it could screw people's configs

[2015/11/09 12:30:39] <Karkus> If they try to use an older version
[2015/11/09 12:30:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: You could always copy the file over if it exists in the old location?
[2015/11/09 12:30:51] <Tobbi> Or rather move it, don't kno.

[2015/11/09 12:31:20] <Tobbi> Okay, good!
[2015/11/09 12:31:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: but if someone decides they prefer 0.3.6 and go back, they'll lose their settings.
[2015/11/09 12:32:12] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2015/11/09 12:32:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, copying is not the same as moving, right?
[2015/11/09 12:32:34] <Tobbi> So, if you keep the old file...?
[2015/11/09 12:33:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Good idea. I'll use a 'profile' file to store the current profile.
[2015/11/09 12:33:45] <Tobbi> :-) alright
[2015/11/09 12:33:57] <Karkus> Then old 'config' can stick around
[2015/11/09 12:34:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: We just need to make sure that people don't mistakenly try to alter their old config.
[2015/11/09 12:36:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'll get it to add a comment warning that this is a 0.3.6 config file and is ignored by 0.4.0
[2015/11/09 12:36:37] <Tobbi> Sure! That sounds good. Hopefully it's not too complicated.

[2015/11/09 14:02:06] <Tobbi_> though I should probably add it.
[2015/11/09 14:02:08] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I didn't want to ping you :)

[2015/11/09 14:05:14] <Tobbi_> Karkus, It's alright... :P
[2015/11/09 14:05:27] <Tobbi_> Karkus, You know, sometimes I overload people with work, for the sake of doing it.
[2015/11/09 14:05:29] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Oh, haha
[2015/11/09 14:05:35] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I don't mind
[2015/11/09 14:05:51] <Tobbi_> Karkus, I do. Because I am rather worried about people getting overworked.
[2015/11/09 14:06:04] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I'm not overworked
[2015/11/09 14:06:17] <Karkus> We have a deadline, and it needs meeting
[2015/11/09 14:06:22] <Tobbi_> Karkus, I know, but it can get that way too fast when you're getting overinvolved. :-)
[2015/11/09 14:06:34] <Tobbi_> I know that from my Mozilla contributor days.
[2015/11/09 14:06:43] <Karkus> I can add it to my new todo list http://swapoff.org/devtodo.html
[2015/11/09 14:06:46] <Tobbi_> But it's good that you'll take a break when you feel like it ;)

[2015/11/10 12:18:37] <Hume2> Hello, head8debian!
[2015/11/10 12:19:07] <Hume2> Someone should exterminate Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 12:19:48] <head8debian> Hume2: Nah, just windows.
[2015/11/10 12:20:08] <head8debian> Microsoft hasdone some cool things.
[2015/11/10 12:21:09] <Hume2> Just wait 70 years until the copyright laws will run out.
[2015/11/10 12:21:48] <Hume2> I read what Windows 10 everything does. I just feel a big rage.
[2015/11/10 12:21:48] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:21:53] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/10 12:22:03] <head8debian> Karkus: o_O
[2015/11/10 12:22:18] <Karkus> head8debian: What?
[2015/11/10 12:22:42] @ Quit: alket: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2015/11/10 12:23:00] <Hume2> When Windows10 spies all the computers, it should work vice-versa too.
[2015/11/10 12:23:34] <Karkus> head8debian:idk how we do the windows builds.
[2015/11/10 12:24:51] <head8debian> Karkus: Good question.
[2015/11/10 12:24:53] <head8debian> Hume2: :D
[2015/11/10 12:25:03] <Hume2> Karkus: Please don't. Windows is a spyware.
[2015/11/10 12:25:28] <head8debian> Windows is a pile of crud, but people use it, so we have to also.
[2015/11/10 12:25:41] <Hume2> No, we don't have to.
[2015/11/10 12:26:10] <Hume2> Yes, people are monkeys, even I am a monkey. Monkeys must do the same as the others.
[2015/11/10 12:26:40] <head8debian> We can support it, but it doesn't mean we have to use it ourselves. :)
[2015/11/10 12:27:00] <Hume2> Yes.
[2015/11/10 12:27:19] <Hume2> It needs to hack the camera to send some random faces.
[2015/11/10 12:27:29] <head8debian> I do use it, and what little i don't like...
[2015/11/10 12:27:34] <Hume2> Don't you know how to make a random face generator?
[2015/11/10 12:27:55] <head8debian> Ehm, no?
[2015/11/10 12:28:26] <Hume2> I think, messing up Microsoft's server with junk data could work.
[2015/11/10 12:28:34] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/10 12:28:57] <head8debian> How are you going to mess up their servers when they use linux? :p
[2015/11/10 12:29:07] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 12:29:36] <Hume2> Well, let's start milions virtual machines with windows 10.
[2015/11/10 12:29:54] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 264 seconds
[2015/11/10 12:30:04] <Hume2> Well, that's not a good idea.
[2015/11/10 12:30:14] <head8debian> It would take more like billions...
[2015/11/10 12:31:01] <Hume2> Do you think that they have any backups of that spy-data?
[2015/11/10 12:32:35] <Hume2> I read that a new type of viruses have been invited. They install your OS as a virtual machine, so you can't get that they are even on your computer. Any way.
[2015/11/10 12:34:37] <Hume2> They could then send fake data to the camera and keyboard.
[2015/11/10 12:35:31] <Hume2> ...but no idea how to make those viruses...
[2015/11/10 12:36:38] <brmbrmcar> Awesome hacks!
[2015/11/10 12:40:05] <brmbrmcar> On a Microsoft e-mail account, I think that you can change your name to a script, possibly accessing more scripts that could destroy the servers.
[2015/11/10 12:40:54] <Hume2> I guess that special characters are blocked, so that wouldn't work. However, it could be good if that worked.
[2015/11/10 12:43:17] <brmbrmcar> It allows all xharacters.
[2015/11/10 12:45:58] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I think that it just displays those characters, but they are saved another way.
[2015/11/10 12:47:10] <Hume2> Anyway, it would have to run that script somehow. And I don't think that their software is equiped to run the scripts from usernames.
[2015/11/10 12:48:31] @ bb010g joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:48:59] <head8debian> Just drop a bomb on one of their server rooms...
[2015/11/10 12:49:45] <Hume2> That works too, but it's quite too simple.
[2015/11/10 12:51:11] <Hume2> Anyway, when it sends the users' photos, it can measure the dimensions of their skull.
[2015/11/10 12:51:40] <brmbrmcar> I know it works to run scripts to make you an admin.
[2015/11/10 12:51:55] <Hume2> So they know, what race you are and where you live. Doesn't it resemble you anything?
[2015/11/10 12:52:39] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes, but some kind of boss must make you an admin. And there are tons of passwords.
[2015/11/10 12:53:48] <brmbrmcar> I mean, the develpors surely use some sort of GUI.
[2015/11/10 12:54:28] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:54:41] <Hume2> Yes, that's it. You'd have to force a developer to make you an admin.
[2015/11/10 12:55:02] <brmbrmcar> I'll try and find a video of the hack.
[2015/11/10 12:56:32] <brmbrmcar> I cannot find it. Probably taken down.
[2015/11/10 13:00:00] <Hume2> Do you think that they could misuse the data to make a genocide?
[2015/11/10 13:01:03] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/10 13:01:09] <brmbrmcar> But they wouldn't.
[2015/11/10 13:01:48] <Hume2> Could we be sure?
[2015/11/10 13:03:45] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/10 13:03:59] <brmbrmcar> We need to destroy Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 13:04:11] <brmbrmcar> Before they destroy one of us.
[2015/11/10 13:04:39] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2015/11/10 13:05:08] <Hume2> It needs something easy and effective.
[2015/11/10 13:08:24] @ Wuzzy joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 13:09:06] <Hume2> What about funny wideos with anti-Windows theme? Can it ever become popular?
[2015/11/10 13:12:12] <Hume2> What about a new SuperTux sign with crossed Windows logo?
[2015/11/10 13:12:34] <brmbrmcar> Supertux logo!
[2015/11/10 13:12:47] <brmbrmcar> No Apple builds either.
[2015/11/10 13:13:01] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: We need Tobbi though
[2015/11/10 13:14:50] <Hume2> I like those anti-Windowsish memes, they are so funny!
[2015/11/10 13:15:49] <Hume2> Automatic updates on Windows 8: Changing shape, don't turn off the computer.
[2015/11/10 13:16:17] <Hume2> Widows 8 causes the global warming.
[2015/11/10 13:16:38] <brmbrmcar> It certainally contributes to it.
[2015/11/10 13:17:54] <Hume2> Windows 8 needs a bazilion of ventilators to don't melt.
[2015/11/10 13:18:49] <brmbrmcar> Windows 8 overheats computers.
[2015/11/10 13:18:52] <Hume2> One pin of procesor has melted down. If not, correct it.
[2015/11/10 13:19:36] <Hume2> Your RAM is not supprted. Try DDR6 or newer.
[2015/11/10 13:24:10] <brmbrmcar> Please make this freezer colder.
[2015/11/10 13:25:44] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:28:30] <brmbrmcar> My laptop is fanless and has never overheated.
[2015/11/10 13:28:53] <brmbrmcar> Windows computers overheat in Antarctica.
[2015/11/10 13:28:58] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:29:31] <Hume2> Is it allowed to stick anti-Windowsish memes on the streats?
[2015/11/10 13:30:49] <brmbrmcar> Maybe.

[2015/11/10 13:31:55] <Hume2> It can't be a comparing ad, so there can't be any advertisement to any other system.
[2015/11/10 13:32:58] <brmbrmcar> How about advertise Windows, but make it bad?
[2015/11/10 13:33:42] <Hume2> Yes, like an ad, that will freak out more likely.
[2015/11/10 13:34:01] <brmbrmcar> Like Windows 10. Want to be hacked?
[2015/11/10 13:34:11] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:34:50] <Hume2> Or something that will not metion that it's about Windows, but still freaking out of it.
[2015/11/10 13:35:13] <Hume2> For example, there will be "Blindous 10" instead of "Windows 10".
[2015/11/10 13:35:32] <brmbrmcar> HP Stream. The 200 euro brick.
[2015/11/10 13:35:42] <Hume2> What's that?
[2015/11/10 13:36:25] <brmbrmcar> It is a cheap Chromebook competitor that runs Windows.

[2015/11/10 14:10:40] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Do you know personally anyone who tells that Windows 10 is good?
[2015/11/10 14:11:44] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Only kids like Windows 10.
[2015/11/10 14:11:55] <brmbrmcar> And Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 14:12:21] <Hume2> Just find someone who will stick those things across the streats.
[2015/11/10 14:13:04] <brmbrmcar> Easy.
[2015/11/10 14:13:28] <Hume2> Narre could do that :D
[2015/11/10 14:13:55] <Hume2> Don't ever tell him that I mentioned him, he doesn't like it.
[2015/11/10 14:14:17] <Hume2> Sometimes at night...
[2015/11/10 14:14:32] <Hume2> And watch out the hidden cameras.
[2015/11/10 14:16:37] <brmbrmcar> If he did it carefully, he could probably do it in a blindspot.
[2015/11/10 14:17:20] <Hume2> If I was sure that noone could see me, I'd do it.
[2015/11/10 14:19:26] <Hume2> I could stick some to the bus stops those are already sticked by many stuff.
[2015/11/10 14:20:05] <brmbrmcar> I was thinking of bus stops.
[2015/11/10 14:21:53] <Hume2> Do you think that it could have any effect?
[2015/11/10 14:22:02] <brmbrmcar> Possibly.
[2015/11/10 14:22:11] <Hume2> Same for me.
[2015/11/10 14:22:59] <brmbrmcar> Maybe if it was very high quality, people wouldn't take it as much of a joke.
[2015/11/10 14:23:19] <brmbrmcar> And at the bottom write on legal stuff.
[2015/11/10 14:24:26] <Hume2> Yes. I think that there should be also someting that is called "Blindous 10". I could be really whatever, even an application that throws an error and closes.
[2015/11/10 14:24:46] <Hume2> And it must be for free.
[2015/11/10 14:25:18] <brmbrmcar> Open source.
[2015/11/10 14:25:35] <Hume2> Why not?
[2015/11/10 14:26:52] <brmbrmcar> Indeed.
[2015/11/10 14:28:57] <Hume2> Well, is there something that it could contain in addition?
[2015/11/10 14:30:54] <Hume2> I think that the people should notice it, so I wouldn't add much detail.
[2015/11/10 14:32:26] <Hume2> Is there a possibility that it would be in TV?
[2015/11/10 14:32:41] <brmbrmcar> How much does it cost?
[2015/11/10 14:34:09] <Hume2> Well, it costs one piece of paper and some glue. Not much.

[2015/11/11 11:42:30] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: So why the level andrews_island_level6.stl has a castle background?
[2015/11/11 11:42:40] <brmbrmcar> Will fix.
[2015/11/11 11:42:57] <brmbrmcar> I also noticed a couple of things I forgot.
[2015/11/11 11:43:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: ;( My neighbor down the road has 10mb/s internet. And im stuck on 3 with a unreliable ISP. :( :p
[2015/11/11 11:43:01] <maths22> Also, I have discovered my RPM build does nto work
[2015/11/11 11:43:08] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:43:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Ask them to upgrade you.
[2015/11/11 11:43:25] <maths22> Tobbi: what version of OSX are you on?
[2015/11/11 11:43:47] <Tobbi> maths22: 10.11.1
[2015/11/11 11:44:13] <maths22> OK.  That actually may be why it doesn't work
[2015/11/11 11:44:27] <maths22> I'll see if I can test/debug on a machine with El Capitan
[2015/11/11 11:45:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, they wouldn't because the person with the tower chose their most expensive plan. :D
[2015/11/11 11:45:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh? :D
[2015/11/11 11:45:44] <Tobbi> I see.
[2015/11/11 11:45:56] <head8debian> $120/month...
[2015/11/11 11:46:49] <head8debian> I have better upload speeds then them yet though. :D
[2015/11/11 11:47:37] <maths22> Tobbi: What kind of error do you get?
[2015/11/11 11:49:02] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: the level 5 was unlaunchable, so I corrected it.
[2015/11/11 11:49:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: And i suposably have a bandwidth cap which ive never seen implemented when ive gone 5 times over it...
[2015/11/11 11:49:20] <Tobbi> maths22: you can't open the application because it may be damaged or incomplete
[2015/11/11 11:49:28] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:49:40] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You can edit the infoblock's message by editor. It's called "edit script", but it's the message in fact.
[2015/11/11 11:49:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: roughtly 100gb. :p
[2015/11/11 11:49:53] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:50:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't have a bandwidth cap, fortunately.
[2015/11/11 11:50:06] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: I k-now.
[2015/11/11 11:50:08] <head8debian> :)
[2015/11/11 11:50:16] <maths22> Tobbi: see http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/58086
[2015/11/11 11:50:19] <brmbrmcar> How do you change the font though?
[2015/11/11 11:50:33] <maths22> Do you have that set to Anywhere, or something else?
[2015/11/11 11:50:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: Your a city slicker... i live in the middle of knowwhere, 10 miles from decent internet. Ok, more like 3. :p
[2015/11/11 11:50:42] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You put the formating char to the begining.
[2015/11/11 11:50:52] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: # stands for normal text.
[2015/11/11 11:50:58] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/11 11:51:07] <brmbrmcar> Didn't know that.
[2015/11/11 11:51:15] * head8debian should just start running fiber from house to house out here... then set up a cache server...
[2015/11/11 11:51:20] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: - stands for big text, space is small text and tab is blue text.
[2015/11/11 11:51:51] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: ! stands for image and any other char is black text.
[2015/11/11 11:53:22] <Tobbi> maths22: Hmm, supertux opens just fine when I double-click on the contained executable.
[2015/11/11 11:53:37] <maths22> That is what I expected
[2015/11/11 11:53:48] <maths22> It is a silly OS X security issue type of thing
[2015/11/11 11:53:57] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: For the level 5, it's nice. Just take a look at note 5 or 4. You can just add some poles so the wood won't levitate.
[2015/11/11 11:54:08] <Tobbi> maths22: No, the issue is still there, even if I disable that thingy from above.
[2015/11/11 11:54:22] <maths22> Tobbi: I figured
[2015/11/11 11:55:18] <maths22> I'll try to fix that this afternoon
[2015/11/11 11:56:00] <maths22> I also need to change linux so it includes the libraries in the package
[2015/11/11 11:56:39] <Tobbi> maths22: So, do you know what's wrong then?
[2015/11/11 11:57:20] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: level6, We have a cave background, even a cave music, so you can use it.
[2015/11/11 11:57:32] <maths22> Not sure, but since it is not an El Capitan specifc issue, I should be able to debug it
[2015/11/11 11:57:56] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/11 11:59:04] <maths22> Can you try editing the Info.plist so that CFBundleExecutable is SuperTux and not supertux2?
[2015/11/11 12:00:00] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: For level6, take a look at notes 4, 5, 6, 14 and 31.
[2015/11/11 12:00:43] <Tobbi> maths22: 11.11.15 17:58:06,159 lsd[367]: LaunchServices: Could not store lsd-identifiers file at /private/var/db/lsd/com.apple.lsdschemes.plist
[2015/11/11 12:00:48] <Tobbi> That's what I get.
[2015/11/11 12:00:53] <Tobbi> Not sure if it helps you in any way.
[2015/11/11 12:02:33] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: OK.
[2015/11/11 12:03:29] <maths22> Tobbi: thanks.  I'll take a look later on my school's machines
[2015/11/11 12:03:34] <Tobbi> Sure.

[2015/11/11 12:28:39] <maths22> Ideally, more of our version numbers would be in the same place (so we don't have to go tracking each of them down to update the version)

[2015/11/11 12:45:43] <Tobbi> Apparently I didn't exceed the character count.
[2015/11/11 12:45:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: what_
[2015/11/11 12:45:46] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/11/11 12:46:31] <head8debian> Im tryign to set up squid with 2 ethernet cards and nano... :p
[2015/11/11 12:46:33] <mt> no https (or at least hashes) for the nightly builds?
[2015/11/11 12:46:56] <Tobbi> ask maths22
[2015/11/11 12:47:18] <mt> next week you'll have no execuse for not supporting TLS (https://letsencrypt.org/) :P
[2015/11/11 12:47:55] <Tobbi> great!
[2015/11/11 12:51:35] <brmbrmcar> maths22: How do I install the linux tar.gz file?
[2015/11/11 12:53:50] <Tobbi> maths22, head8debian, Karkus, mt: What do you guys think? http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=6630
[2015/11/11 12:55:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: Great!
[2015/11/11 12:55:59] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 12:56:04] <Tobbi> So there's that.
[2015/11/11 12:56:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: The only thing on that list which has remained unaffected by this project is my cat
[2015/11/11 12:56:50] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 12:58:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: If I had a cat, I believe, I'd try Schroedinger's experiment with it.
[2015/11/11 12:58:47] <Tobbi> So, it's good that I don't have one.
[2015/11/11 12:58:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah
[2015/11/11 12:59:13] <Karkus> Probably
[2015/11/11 12:59:48] <Karkus> Not a very interesting experiment really though is it Tobbi?
[2015/11/11 13:00:09] <Karkus> Outcomes 1) Cat ded 2) Cat live
[2015/11/11 13:00:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: Not as interesting as the Babies-in-the-dishwasher experiment. Exactly!
[2015/11/11 13:00:42] <Tobbi> While the babies-in-the-dishwasher experiment has a multitude of different outcomes, fractures, amount of blood etc.
[2015/11/11 13:01:03] <Karkus> And all of them are super exciting!
[2015/11/11 13:01:26] <Tobbi> For sure!
[2015/11/11 13:01:37] <brmbrmcar> Poor babies.
[2015/11/11 13:03:34] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: No, wrong. Poor dishwasher, rather.
[2015/11/11 13:03:36] <Karkus> Well, older rich people don't submit themse as willing volunteers
[2015/11/11 13:03:43] <Karkus> themselves*
[2015/11/11 13:06:29] <brmbrmcar> How about my method of harming babies?
[2015/11/11 13:06:36] <brmbrmcar> No restraint.
[2015/11/11 13:06:39] <brmbrmcar> Crash!
[2015/11/11 13:08:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: You, know what's best about nightly builds?
[2015/11/11 13:09:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: what?

[2015/11/11 13:09:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: good? I think that's a bad thing :D
[2015/11/11 13:09:44] <Tobbi> Meaning more bugs for all of us.
[2015/11/11 13:09:50] <Tobbi> But wait, we had that topic, already.
[2015/11/11 13:10:16] <brmbrmcar> Bugs are good.

[2015/11/11 13:15:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Shall I close it?
[2015/11/11 13:15:17] <mt> maths22: please - try to link the linux binaries statically, else it will break on distros that don't use the same library versions as the build system's distro
[2015/11/11 13:15:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: You could. I wonder how often maths22 is willing to build these, but, yeah, go ahead.
[2015/11/11 13:16:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: Manually built?
[2015/11/11 13:16:10] <mt> maths22: like "games/supertux2: error while loading shared libraries: libGLEW.so.1.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory", I'm already using glew-1.13.0
[2015/11/11 13:16:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, I mean "trigger a build", afaik he still has to do it.
[2015/11/11 13:16:41] <brmbrmcar> ./supertux2: error while loading shared libraries: libtinygettext.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[2015/11/11 13:17:00] <mt> brmbrmcar: yeah that's because it's not statically linked
[2015/11/11 13:17:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, it can't be considered a nightly release then...
[2015/11/11 13:17:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: hmm, right....but maybe he is willing to build them every day.
[2015/11/11 13:17:35] <mt> Karkus: well, you can write a cronjob triggering it every night
[2015/11/11 13:17:55] <Tobbi> I could've labeled them developer releases, but that would be confusing.
[2015/11/11 13:18:00] <brmbrmcar> mt:So what do I have to do?
[2015/11/11 13:18:25] <mt> brmbrmcar: wait until the builds are statically linked
[2015/11/11 13:18:54] <brmbrmcar> What can I do in the meantime? Do i have to build tinygettext?
[2015/11/11 13:19:02] <Karkus> mt: But does he want to? (or rather will he?)
[2015/11/11 13:19:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah, not that
[2015/11/11 13:19:50] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Why do you depend on developer releases. You know how to build supertux, don't you?
[2015/11/11 13:20:20] <brmbrmcar> Not really.
[2015/11/11 13:20:37] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You never built supertux yourself?
[2015/11/11 13:20:39] <brmbrmcar> I don't know how to build sdl 2.03.
[2015/11/11 13:20:48] <brmbrmcar> I used the ppa.
[2015/11/11 13:20:48] <Tobbi> Do you need to build it?
[2015/11/11 13:20:54] <Tobbi> So, where's the problem?
[2015/11/11 13:20:55] <brmbrmcar> On Ubuntu.
[2015/11/11 13:21:07] <brmbrmcar> All sorts of bugs.
[2015/11/11 13:21:20] <brmbrmcar> And this was on my previous Ubuntu install.
[2015/11/11 13:21:22] <mt> Building on Ubuntu works just fine
[2015/11/11 13:21:35] <mt> Travis builds are running on ubuntu
[2015/11/11 13:21:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe we should assemble a WIP release notes document.
[2015/11/11 13:21:53] <Tobbi> And make it organization-visible only for now.
[2015/11/11 13:22:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: On Google docs for example?
[2015/11/11 13:22:21] <Karkus> Or what and how?
[2015/11/11 13:22:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: I wonder if Github allows you to do secret wiki pages?
[2015/11/11 13:22:28] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/11 13:22:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Secret gist?
[2015/11/11 13:22:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: I like this idea very much.
[2015/11/11 13:22:54] <Tobbi> That might work!
[2015/11/11 13:23:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: It doesn't have to be secret...
[2015/11/11 13:23:24] <Tobbi> Sure, I just don't want people to assume this is an actual release right now.
[2015/11/11 13:23:30] <Tobbi> So, yeah, indeed, there's nothing secret about it.
[2015/11/11 13:24:22] <brmbrmcar> So I can't see it!
[2015/11/11 13:25:06] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What?
[2015/11/11 13:25:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Are you drafting the gist or shall I?
[2015/11/11 13:25:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: How do I create a gist as SuperTux?
[2015/11/11 13:25:32] <Tobbi> Ah, one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:25:34] <brmbrmcar> I won't be able to see it!
[2015/11/11 13:25:44] <brmbrmcar> It is a secret.
[2015/11/11 13:25:58] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: We'll see.
[2015/11/11 13:26:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: Having a secret gist would be a little complex
[2015/11/11 13:26:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, anyone with the url could see it
[2015/11/11 13:26:38] <Karkus> but the URL wouldn't have to be publiv
[2015/11/11 13:26:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: There doesn't seem to be any way to create a gist as an organization.
[2015/11/11 13:27:13] <Tobbi> https://gist.github.com/tobbi/c9fd5380aed73ce4bb82
[2015/11/11 13:27:18] <Tobbi> Wonder if you can access it and edit it.
[2015/11/11 13:28:22] <brmbrmcar> I can see it.
[2015/11/11 13:28:28] <Tobbi> Yes, but editing...
[2015/11/11 13:28:41] <Tobbi> actually, one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:28:46] <mt> I wonder if forking as organization would work
[2015/11/11 13:28:49] <brmbrmcar> Not editing.
[2015/11/11 13:28:58] <Karkus> Nope.
[2015/11/11 13:30:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: Damn.
[2015/11/11 13:30:31] <Tobbi> one moment, I'll find a way...
[2015/11/11 13:30:32] <brmbrmcar> I forked it.
[2015/11/11 13:30:33] <Tobbi> an etherpad, or something.
[2015/11/11 13:30:39] <brmbrmcar> And could edit.
[2015/11/11 13:30:48] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Won't help.
[2015/11/11 13:31:21] <brmbrmcar> I k-now.

[2015/11/11 13:33:41] <leyyin> Tobbi, your document is getting vandalized
[2015/11/11 13:33:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: By you?
[2015/11/11 13:34:03] <leyyin> I only added "Woohooo"
[2015/11/11 13:34:07] <Tobbi> gargh
[2015/11/11 13:34:11] <Tobbi> Let's try the wiki.
[2015/11/11 13:34:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: I added git shortlog v0.3.5..HEAD
[2015/11/11 13:34:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: I just wondered if it worked
[2015/11/11 13:34:35] <Tobbi> Aka, all commits since v0.3.5a
[2015/11/11 13:34:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, all the git commits
[2015/11/11 13:34:41] <Tobbi> oh!
[2015/11/11 13:34:41] <Karkus> Okay
[2015/11/11 13:34:43] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:34:47] <Tobbi> Wrong version.
[2015/11/11 13:35:04] <mt> can '^Merge pull request #.*' be excluded
[2015/11/11 13:35:20] <brmbrmcar> I think so.
[2015/11/11 13:35:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: You can stop it getting vandalised by just anyone can you not?
[2015/11/11 13:35:30] <Tobbi> I could
[2015/11/11 13:35:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe we should use the wiki, though.
[2015/11/11 13:35:40] <Tobbi> Now that I think about it.
[2015/11/11 13:35:47] <Karkus> I typed the newlines. But they're gone now
[2015/11/11 13:35:51] <Tobbi> Anyone here who does not have a wiki account?
[2015/11/11 13:36:03] <Karkus> Err... Me I think.
[2015/11/11 13:36:06] <Karkus> Let me check
[2015/11/11 13:36:27] <brmbrmcar> Done.
[2015/11/11 13:36:38] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: done what?
[2015/11/11 13:37:59] <brmbrmcar> Removed merge pull requests.

[2015/11/11 13:46:44] <mt> ok
[2015/11/11 13:47:23] <maths22> Also, once it is integrated into the offical repos, it should be triggered by a push
[2015/11/11 13:47:46] <Tobbi> maths22: How often will you trigger builds?
[2015/11/11 13:48:40] <maths22> Tobbi: once everything is working, there will be a set of pull requests (to tinygettext, squirrel, and supertux)
[2015/11/11 13:48:47] <maths22> After that, it will run on every commit
[2015/11/11 13:49:05] <maths22> it uses travis to handle the OS X and Linux builds
[2015/11/11 13:49:10] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 13:49:16] <maths22> AppVeyor is used to handle Windows
[2015/11/11 13:49:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: Mediawiki is great! It doesn't allow me to change a password for a user without access to a database.
[2015/11/11 13:49:42] <Tobbi> It only allows me to send a password reset email :D
[2015/11/11 13:50:10] <maths22> Also, I think I may change the upload name to include the commit hash (and only keep tags and the 10 most recent or something like that)
[2015/11/11 13:50:18] <maths22> I also need to fix the OSX icon
[2015/11/11 13:51:23] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: What's wrong with that?

[2015/11/11 13:52:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: PM
[2015/11/11 13:55:31] <leyyin> maths22, any documentation on how you did the builds on travis? :D
[2015/11/11 13:57:40] <Tobbi> Oh! AppVeyor is free for opensource apps...
[2015/11/11 13:57:41] <Tobbi> Great!
[2015/11/11 13:58:43] <brmbrmcar> Free!
[2015/11/11 13:59:03] <head8debian> Yay! Polipo! :p
[2015/11/11 13:59:26] <brmbrmcar> Celebrate!
[2015/11/11 13:59:32] <brmbrmcar> :)
[2015/11/11 13:59:47] <Tobbi> We could actually assemble a list of people who contributed and update the credits.
[2015/11/11 14:00:03] <Tobbi> If the number of contributions is > n where n is a positive integeer.
[2015/11/11 14:00:06] <Tobbi> *integer
[2015/11/11 14:00:22] <leyyin> 2^128
[2015/11/11 14:00:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Contributions is a fairly arbitrary unit, isn't it?
[2015/11/11 14:01:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yeah, indeed.
[2015/11/11 14:01:12] <maths22> leyyin: No documentation yet.  I can write some up once I have cleaned up my .travis.yml to be less ugly
[2015/11/11 14:01:56] <brmbrmcar> brmbrmcar Absolutely Nothing
[2015/11/11 14:02:07] <leyyin> ah, I found it, thanks maths22
[2015/11/11 14:03:39] <maths22> I also need to re-enable debug builds, etc, but only make these binaries for the release one
[2015/11/11 14:04:12] <maths22> Also, I think my branch only works in LLVM, so I need to fix that
[2015/11/11 14:04:24] <Tobbi> Hah! The overall number of my commits to SuperTux is 444
[2015/11/11 14:04:41] <leyyin> nice, I did not know about the apt addon in travis, TIL
[2015/11/11 14:04:58] <maths22> leyyin: it is relatively new
[2015/11/11 14:05:02] <Karkus> Mine should soon rise to 9
[2015/11/11 14:05:33] <maths22> also, SDL2 is only in the offical repos on 14.04, so I have it build on 14.04 so we don't need to build it ourselves
[2015/11/11 14:06:05] <Karkus> maths22 is it building automatically each day?
[2015/11/11 14:06:08] <Tobbi> maths22: Wait, travis allows you to build on 14.04 now?
[2015/11/11 14:06:27] <maths22> see https://github.com/maths22/supertux/blob/master/.travis.yml
[2015/11/11 14:06:32] <maths22> Karkus: not yet
[2015/11/11 14:06:51] <Tobbi> That is great!
[2015/11/11 14:06:57] <maths22> Once I have everything working and polished up, I will submit a pull request to the official repository, and this will hopefully get integrated in
[2015/11/11 14:07:01] <Tobbi> Sure, thanks!
[2015/11/11 14:07:15] <maths22> Karkus: then it will run with every push
[2015/11/11 14:07:17] <Tobbi> maths22: Does that add-on do deps caching? I assume no?
[2015/11/11 14:07:38] <maths22> Tobbi: no, but it runs pretty fast
[2015/11/11 14:07:42] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 14:07:53] <maths22> Builds (with packaging and uploads) take ~7 minutes
[2015/11/11 14:08:05] <Karkus> maths22: Every push!?
[2015/11/11 14:08:08] <maths22> https://travis-ci.org/maths22/supertux
[2015/11/11 14:08:13] <maths22> Karkus: yep!
[2015/11/11 14:08:22] <maths22> It just adds a step to the end of travis
[2015/11/11 14:08:53] <leyyin> and now you can do mac build too, hmm
[2015/11/11 14:08:56] <leyyin> windows too? :D
[2015/11/11 14:09:11] <maths22> leyyin: windows through AppVeyor
[2015/11/11 14:09:12] <Tobbi> Who cares about Windows? :P
[2015/11/11 14:09:32] <maths22> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maths22/supertux
[2015/11/11 14:09:33] <brmbrmcar> I don't.
[2015/11/11 14:09:39] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I was being ironic.
[2015/11/11 14:09:40] <brmbrmcar> Who cares about OSX?
[2015/11/11 14:09:46] <brmbrmcar> You.
[2015/11/11 14:09:51] <maths22> Tobbi: people who use Windows
[2015/11/11 14:09:55] <maths22> brmbrmcar: people who use OSX
[2015/11/11 14:09:56] <maths22> :)
[2015/11/11 14:10:00] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/11 14:10:11] <brmbrmcar> I use Linux
[2015/11/11 14:10:18] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I figured
[2015/11/11 14:10:48] <brmbrmcar> There is no good alternative apart from browser operating systems.
[2015/11/11 14:10:53] <Karkus> Who cares about Linux
[2015/11/11 14:10:57] <Karkus> :P
[2015/11/11 14:11:01] <Karkus> jk
[2015/11/11 14:11:28] <maths22> I also created a new dependency zip that includes the newest boot and VC14 boost libraries
[2015/11/11 14:11:39] <leyyin> maths22, so this is the only file you need for appveyor https://github.com/maths22/supertux/blob/master/appveyor.yml ?
[2015/11/11 14:11:52] <maths22> leyyin: yes
[2015/11/11 14:12:27] <maths22> It is nice and clean
[2015/11/11 14:12:31] <Tobbi> maths22: Could you package our final release as well? Or rather build a release build when we want to release?
[2015/11/11 14:12:54] <maths22> Tobbi: I will have it keep tagged builds (and not clean them up)
[2015/11/11 14:13:01] <maths22> It will also name tagged builds differently
[2015/11/11 14:13:03] <Tobbi> Great!
[2015/11/11 14:13:15] <maths22> (How that will work, I'm not yet sure, but I'll figure it out)
[2015/11/11 14:13:30] * leyyin takes notes for STK
[2015/11/11 14:13:33] <maths22> Tobbi: it also only packages the release one
[2015/11/11 14:13:58] <maths22> Also, can we assemble a list of everywhere we use the version number (or development state, like the main logo)
[2015/11/11 14:14:23] <Tobbi> yeah, we should do that.
[2015/11/11 14:15:54] <Tobbi> By the way, guys: http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Changelog_0.4.0_%28WIP%29
[2015/11/11 14:16:21] <Tobbi> Karkus, mt, head8debian, maths22, brmbrmcar ^^ if you want to contribute
[2015/11/11 14:17:00] <Tobbi> We would need to pick the most important changes and create releases notes from them.
[2015/11/11 14:17:16] <maths22> Do we know of anywhere besides CMakeLists.txt and data/images/objects/logo/logo.sprite
[2015/11/11 14:17:17] <Tobbi> I suggest we keep out the xmas stuff though, in order to keep them a surprise.
[2015/11/11 14:17:46] <Tobbi> CMakeLists.txt
[2015/11/11 14:17:53] <Tobbi> it uses patch levels etc.
[2015/11/11 14:17:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: So this isn't the actual file, just a draft of things which have been added?
[2015/11/11 14:18:05] <Karkus> To be developed into that.
[2015/11/11 14:18:11] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, exactly.
[2015/11/11 14:18:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: However, I intend to just move the file once it's ready and supertux is about to be released.
[2015/11/11 14:20:09] <maths22> Tobbi: for releases, we can actually use http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/
[2015/11/11 14:20:24] <maths22> Tobbi: they will then go straight into github
[2015/11/11 14:20:38] <maths22> I will mess with that feature later
[2015/11/11 14:21:20] <Tobbi> maths22: How would those be triggered? We just add tags?
[2015/11/11 14:21:46] <maths22> I believe so
[2015/11/11 14:22:04] <maths22> I'll investigate tonight
[2015/11/11 14:22:12] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/11 14:23:08] <leyyin> maths22, only the new containers are 14.04? not the old infrastructure
[2015/11/11 14:27:30] <leyyin> actually we can do windows cross compiling on linux, who needs windows anyways :P
[2015/11/11 14:27:41] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/11 14:27:47] <Tobbi> leyyin: well, I use it regularly...
[2015/11/11 14:29:18] <maths22> leyyin: i actually was going to cross-comple, but then I discovered appveyor
[2015/11/11 14:29:51] <leyyin> one problem I think it is, how you can upload the bundles securely to your file server
[2015/11/11 14:30:04] <leyyin> so that no one can hijack the upload, and upload something malicious
[2015/11/11 14:30:37] <maths22> the key will be changed and moved on an encrypted envvar

[2015/11/11 14:32:45] <maths22> it also doesnt populate them for pull requests, so a nalicious pull request cant hurt

[2015/11/11 14:56:18] <brmbrmcar> OK then.
[2015/11/11 14:59:15] <maths22> Tobbi: I also should add source tarballs (at least for tags)
[2015/11/11 14:59:24] <Tobbi> sounds good!
[2015/11/11 14:59:40] <maths22> Actually, github does that for us
[2015/11/11 14:59:42] <maths22> never mind that
[2015/11/11 15:02:33] <Tobbi> hmm.
[2015/11/11 15:05:03] <brmbrmcar> I looked through all the projects,
[2015/11/11 15:05:20] <brmbrmcar> How long has it been up for?

[2015/11/11 15:06:00] <maths22> s/notification/notifier/
[2015/11/11 15:06:00] <red_bot> maths22 meant: "Tobbi: is the notifier not in the github repo settings?"
[2015/11/11 15:06:23] <Tobbi> maths22: No, it's a webhook (called Notifico)
[2015/11/11 15:06:56] <maths22> OK.  I know GitHub has a decent one built in
[2015/11/11 15:07:06] <maths22> You could probably kill Notifico and enable it if you wanted to
[2015/11/11 15:07:17] <Tobbi> Yeah, or create my own Notifico account.

[2015/11/11 15:47:49] <brmbrmcar> Support what?
[2015/11/11 15:48:07] <brmbrmcar> Oh XP.
[2015/11/11 15:48:26] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/11 15:48:28] <brmbrmcar> Why?
[2015/11/11 15:48:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes.
[2015/11/11 15:48:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: And they have not made any moves to stop supporting it.
[2015/11/11 15:48:54] <Tobbi> Which is good. At least they did something right
[2015/11/11 15:50:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: :p
[2015/11/11 15:50:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: No one should be supporting xp...

[2015/11/11 15:50:25] <brmbrmcar> Do thay support Windows 1.0?
[2015/11/11 15:50:33] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: haha, no.
[2015/11/11 15:51:00] <head8debian> XP is just so crusty...
[2015/11/11 15:51:08] <brmbrmcar> Do they support Chrome OS?
[2015/11/11 15:51:16] <head8debian> I think debian Jessie is old. :p
[2015/11/11 15:51:27] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: I don't know. I doubt it.
[2015/11/11 15:52:03] <brmbrmcar> Soon all Android apps will work, so that means Firefox. :D
[2015/11/11 15:52:58] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Or chrome will merge with android. :)

[2015/11/11 17:03:02] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/11 17:05:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: Can we have multiplayer (on a single keyboard) as part of supertux 3?
[2015/11/11 17:05:38] <Tobbi> Sounds good. File an issue.
[2015/11/11 17:05:43] <Tobbi> We'd also need sprites...
[2015/11/11 17:05:51] <Tobbi> I mean: We need a different player sprite.
[2015/11/11 17:05:55] <Tobbi> and animations and everything.
[2015/11/11 17:05:56] <Karkus> ik
[2015/11/11 17:06:11] <Karkus> But I guess for now we could recolor tux in gimp
[2015/11/11 17:06:19] <Karkus> takes a couple seconds
[2015/11/11 17:06:50] <Tobbi> Possibly, sure.
[2015/11/11 17:07:04] <Tobbi> but since this is for SuperTux 3 anyway...
[2015/11/11 17:07:14] <Tobbi> Karkus: It'd mean split screen, right?
[2015/11/11 17:07:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: TBC
[2015/11/11 17:07:26] <Karkus> To Be Considered
[2015/11/11 17:07:31] <Karkus> In this sense
[2015/11/11 17:07:33] <Tobbi> sounds fun.
[2015/11/11 17:07:34] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 17:08:06] <Karkus> In the Mario games (I know I talk about these a lot) it's not split screen.
[2015/11/11 17:08:25] <Tobbi> I finally (!!) managed to update the add-on index.
[2015/11/11 17:08:27] <Karkus> Split screen would be infinity times harder to implement
[2015/11/11 17:08:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Index?
[2015/11/11 17:08:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: But if one player is faster than the other?
[2015/11/11 17:08:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: I added head8debian's worldmap changes for rubberduck
[2015/11/11 17:09:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: Then the slower gets crushed on the screen
[2015/11/11 17:09:12] <Tobbi> uhm...okay?
[2015/11/11 17:09:13] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 17:09:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Great! Can you now close the issue?
[2015/11/11 17:09:18] <Tobbi> Oh, of course.
[2015/11/11 17:09:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Have you really never played those games
[2015/11/11 17:09:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: To be honest, no! :D
[2015/11/11 17:09:40] <Karkus> New Super Mario Wii etc.

[2015/11/11 17:10:45] <Karkus> Tobbi: We could actually have many players if we used the game controllers
[2015/11/11 17:10:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: Do you own a game controller? :D
[2015/11/11 17:11:04] <Tobbi> Because I don't and thus can't test support for that.
[2015/11/11 17:11:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: I... don't know...
[2015/11/11 17:11:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: What *is* a game controller which is compatible?
[2015/11/11 17:11:38] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/11 17:12:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's an SDL thing isn't it?
[2015/11/11 17:12:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: indeed.
[2015/11/11 17:13:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have also been thinking about a website where people can submit their add-ons. We review them and we can auto-push them to the game.
[2015/11/11 17:13:53] <Tobbi> That would be fun.
[2015/11/11 17:13:56] <Tobbi> No more editing nfo files.

[2015/11/11 17:14:05] <Karkus> https://youtu.be/pipMu0HXiU0?t=50s
[2015/11/11 17:14:09] <Karkus> That one maybe
[2015/11/11 17:15:37] <Tobbi> Interesting.
[2015/11/11 17:15:44] <Tobbi> So, maybe not that hard to implement.
[2015/11/11 17:19:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: Playing with other people over the internet could be fun :D
[2015/11/11 17:19:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: It would, yes
[2015/11/11 17:20:34] <Karkus> I think we could have a huge leader board with top levels created by people all over the place
[2015/11/11 17:20:50] <Karkus> And then you can play them. Multiplayer, too
[2015/11/11 17:21:03] <Karkus> Compete for time or secrets etc.
[2015/11/11 17:21:04] <Tobbi> That would be great.
[2015/11/11 17:21:08] <Tobbi> But also alot of work.
[2015/11/11 17:21:14] <Tobbi> But maybe we'll get people to contribute after 0.4.0
[2015/11/11 17:21:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: No kidding
[2015/11/11 17:21:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: But that's a good thing for a roadmap.
[2015/11/11 17:22:40] <Karkus> Well, top priority after 0.4.0, for me at least, is flexlay. The problem is I think the code is too annoying. I'm not saying I could do better, but I think I could.
[2015/11/11 17:23:15] <Karkus> It's all a bit disorganised

[2015/11/11 17:33:44] <Tobbi> Some of the German translations are so...bad...
[2015/11/11 17:34:07] <Tobbi> "Take your pick" -> <translates as if someone would take an actual "pick">
[2015/11/11 17:34:15] <Tobbi> You know...ice pick for example.
[2015/11/11 17:36:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: tooth pick

[2015/11/12 10:22:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: We had a power outage all morning...
[2015/11/12 10:22:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: Including yourself?
[2015/11/12 10:23:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes?
[2015/11/12 10:24:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: No electric = cannot milk cows...
[2015/11/12 10:24:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: I know, cows don't work... Cows are a direct result of electricity...
[2015/11/12 10:24:51] <Tobbi> Actually, first the electricity, then the cow.
[2015/11/12 10:24:59] <Tobbi> Perfect symbioses.
[2015/11/12 10:25:03] <Tobbi> *symbiosis

[2015/11/12 10:25:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: We could milk them by hand, but its hard to do 100 cows by hand. :)
[2015/11/12 10:25:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: Have you ever sold forged harddisks and cholesterol?
[2015/11/12 10:25:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, no?
[2015/11/12 10:26:05] <Tobbi> alright.
[2015/11/12 10:26:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: And we have roughly 100,000 turkeys being fed around us also, which cannot be fed without electricity.
[2015/11/12 10:26:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: ever tried?
[2015/11/12 10:26:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: I notice that when you put a turkey in a hot stove (= electricity) it tasts better afterwards.
[2015/11/12 10:27:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: I'd rather cook it over a gas stove. :D
[2015/11/12 10:27:17] <head8debian> Much more eficient.
[2015/11/12 10:27:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Gas hasn't been invented yet around here.
[2015/11/12 10:28:18] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/12 10:29:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, basically, whenever we want to cook something, we have people who rotate sticks in order for hay to catch fire.
[2015/11/12 10:29:29] <Tobbi> or something.
[2015/11/12 10:29:41] <Tobbi> Because, we don't know how to deal with electricity.
[2015/11/12 10:29:46] <Tobbi> Sometimes it's there, sometimes it isn't.
[2015/11/12 10:29:55] <Tobbi> Sometimes it's too strong, sometimes it's too low.
[2015/11/12 10:30:10] <Tobbi> Sometimes it's an amoeba.
[2015/11/12 10:31:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm.
[2015/11/12 10:31:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: Us americans find it quite reliable. :D
[2015/11/12 10:32:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: says the one with a power outage.
[2015/11/12 10:32:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its back on now...
[2015/11/12 10:32:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: So twice a year it goes out for a couple hours.
[2015/11/12 10:33:12] <head8debian> It seems to be just with our electricity line.
[2015/11/12 10:33:25] <head8debian> the neighbors never lose electricity.
[2015/11/12 10:33:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Have you ever tried to stack cows on top of each other? In theory that should give you more energy, since there's more potential energy.

[2015/11/12 10:41:11] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 10:48:34] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/12 11:00:47] <mt> Tobbi: it was me who set up notifico, but when there's no option in the "Webhooks & services" section I can't change anything (w/o modifying notifico and then running it on my own server)
[2015/11/12 11:01:03] <mt> I can disable it, but...
[2015/11/12 11:01:18] <Tobbi> mt: hmm...okay, so there's really nothing we can do, for now...
[2015/11/12 11:01:45] <Tobbi> We could ask github to give us fine-grained control.
[2015/11/12 11:01:50] <Tobbi> but that's asking too much, I assume.
[2015/11/12 11:02:19] <mt> Yeah
[2015/11/12 11:03:00] <mt> what wouldn't be asking too much of github would be include all label changes in, say the last minute, in one event
[2015/11/12 11:03:15] <mt> but that would - in the end - also require updating notifico's code

[2015/11/12 11:42:35] <head8debian> Its expensive...
[2015/11/12 11:42:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: Wow, you're growing up to be an ordinary person.
[2015/11/12 11:42:37] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/12 11:43:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, whats that mean?
[2015/11/12 11:43:13] <Tobbi> head8debian: What it means.
[2015/11/12 11:43:17] <brmbrmcar> I hate paying for music.
[2015/11/12 11:44:01] <head8debian> I figured i'd better support support the bands i listen to. Keeps them in buisiness. :)
[2015/11/12 11:45:27] <brmbrmcar> I never buy music.
[2015/11/12 11:45:47] <brmbrmcar> Why would I :P
[2015/11/12 11:46:56] <mt> In Germany, torrenting music is like paying 500 â¬ for a CD
[2015/11/12 11:47:11] <head8debian> mt: Why?
[2015/11/12 11:47:14] <mt> heck, even more
[2015/11/12 11:47:19] <head8debian> Bandwidth that expensive? :p
[2015/11/12 11:47:33] <head8debian> I don't torrent it. Or use any odd websites...
[2015/11/12 11:47:38] <mt> because you'll get an Abmahnung (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abmahnung)
[2015/11/12 11:48:07] <head8debian> Ouch.
[2015/11/12 11:48:16] <brmbrmcar> If I want music, I download a high quality version from Youtube.
[2015/11/12 11:48:26] <brmbrmcar> Completely illegal, but who cares.
[2015/11/12 11:48:37] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Same here... ;)

[2015/11/12 11:48:55] <mt> Sadly, high quality music from youtube or even bought from itunes/google play/amazon isn't really high quality
[2015/11/12 11:48:55] <head8debian> Our church half hinges on youtube...
[2015/11/12 11:49:12] <head8debian> mt: I know what you mean.

[2015/11/12 11:49:44] <head8debian> percent of the profit*
[2015/11/12 11:49:52] <mt> dunno
[2015/11/12 11:49:56] <leyyin> I buy music from my local dealer :D
[2015/11/12 11:49:57] <leyyin> it's free
[2015/11/12 11:50:15] <head8debian> I usually listen to the radio...
[2015/11/12 11:50:24] <leyyin> head8debian, you drive a lot?
[2015/11/12 11:50:25] <brmbrmcar> But these days, quality of CDs is actually getting worse, as most people write to MP3 when making it.
[2015/11/12 11:51:03] <mt> I still know of studios using magnet tape for recording and mastering
[2015/11/12 11:51:09] <head8debian> leyyin: A decent amount. Not much though.
[2015/11/12 11:51:31] <leyyin> radio listening is only when driving :P
[2015/11/12 11:51:41] <head8debian> mt: Alof of studios i know keep it digital as much as possible.
[2015/11/12 11:51:57] <head8debian> Record high quality as digital.
[2015/11/12 11:52:00] <leyyin> if it's lossless, then it's fine
[2015/11/12 11:52:51] <head8debian> As long as it doesn't sound awfull im fine with it. :p
[2015/11/12 11:53:09] <brmbrmcar> Why do people listen to the radio when driving?
[2015/11/12 11:53:29] <brmbrmcar> I listen to all the bumps and creaks!
[2015/11/12 11:53:34] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/11/12 11:53:56] <brmbrmcar> Way better. :D

[2015/11/12 12:02:37] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Vehicle? Or motor?
[2015/11/12 12:02:44] <brmbrmcar> Vehichle.
[2015/11/12 12:02:44] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: A V10.
[2015/11/12 12:02:51] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Ford Excursion.
[2015/11/12 12:03:05] <brmbrmcar> How old?
[2015/11/12 12:03:12] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: 13 years.
[2015/11/12 12:03:17] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: quack it. :p
[2015/11/12 12:03:59] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: The other vehicle is a 2001 Dodge Ram. 24 valve. 6 cylinder Diesel.
[2015/11/12 12:04:21] <head8debian> Actually, its an 8 cylinder.
[2015/11/12 12:04:25] <head8debian> Cummins. :D
[2015/11/12 12:04:59] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/12 12:05:02] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: quack it = look it up on duckduckgo...
[2015/11/12 12:05:08] <brmbrmcar> Both bad for cras tests.
[2015/11/12 12:05:22] <brmbrmcar> That's what I wanted to know.
[2015/11/12 12:05:22] <head8debian> nope, its a 6 valve.
[2015/11/12 12:05:28] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: FOr what?
[2015/11/12 12:05:36] <brmbrmcar> Crashing.
[2015/11/12 12:05:39] <brmbrmcar> Safety.
[2015/11/12 12:05:50] <head8debian> We don't have emissions test and other junk up here... thankfully.
[2015/11/12 12:06:10] <brmbrmcar> Where are you?
[2015/11/12 12:06:13] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Uhm, these vehicles are much safer in a crash than any car.
[2015/11/12 12:06:22] <head8debian> Northern USA?
[2015/11/12 12:06:36] <brmbrmcar> Not into something like a tree.
[2015/11/12 12:06:56] <mt> sadly you don't have emissions tests
[2015/11/12 12:07:01] <brmbrmcar> And also Safe small is better than Dangerous big.
[2015/11/12 12:07:40] <head8debian> brmbrmcar:I dissagree. Do you want to meet a semi with a car or with a truck? Do you want to meet a truck with a car or another truck?
[2015/11/12 12:07:52] <head8debian> Without all the emissions crud Diesels could get 20mpg.
[2015/11/12 12:08:02] <head8debian> Currently they get about 11mpg.
[2015/11/12 12:08:04] <head8debian> mt: o_O
[2015/11/12 12:08:08] <brmbrmcar> Watch the
[2015/11/12 12:08:54] <head8debian> mt: If you show me some sort of emissions stuff that actually works on a diesel engine, then maybei  will change my mind.
[2015/11/12 12:09:01] <head8debian> I understand the CAT converter on a car.

[2015/11/12 12:10:12] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: And up here where we get so much snow you don't want to have a car. You will get stuck before you can blink on half these roads.
[2015/11/12 12:10:51] <head8debian> Also, explain to my why its considered better for the enviroment to have the engine burn twice as much fuel for the same result vs half the fuel for the same result.
[2015/11/12 12:11:40] <brmbrmcar> Anything can go through snow if you are brave.
[2015/11/12 12:12:01] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: LOL. ;)

[2015/11/12 12:14:23] <head8debian> I hate all the electronics in these new cars. Sure they are great while they work, but they are so expensive when they break.
[2015/11/12 12:15:09] <head8debian> Every farmer and person ive talked to that know how this stuff actually works have nothing good to say about it.
[2015/11/12 12:15:18] <head8debian> And neither do i...
[2015/11/12 12:15:45] <brmbrmcar> I want one with an electromagnet to repel other vehichles when they are too close.

[2015/11/12 12:17:04] <brmbrmcar> Easy.
[2015/11/12 12:17:16] <brmbrmcar> More tourque.
[2015/11/12 12:17:30] <head8debian> Which is why you have a truck. :)
[2015/11/12 12:18:36] <brmbrmcar> Trucks never have as much torque as sport vehichles.

[2015/11/12 12:25:45] <brmbrmcar> Are they pets?
[2015/11/12 12:25:56] <head8debian> Tobbi should buy a goat to trim his lawn and eat his trash...
[2015/11/12 12:26:04] <head8debian> They like old fruit better though.

[2015/11/12 12:31:33] <brmbrmcar> Do the goats have restraints?
[2015/11/12 12:31:49] <head8debian> Wheat has never been genetically modified. :D
[2015/11/12 12:32:04] <head8debian> Im no GMO nut. We do what we have to to feed everyone.
[2015/11/12 12:32:12] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Pastures? Yes.
[2015/11/12 12:32:21] <brmbrmcar> Not that.
[2015/11/12 12:32:41] <brmbrmcar> Like safety belts for the back of the truck.
[2015/11/12 12:33:06] <brmbrmcar> THe big one.
[2015/11/12 12:33:45] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Uhm, we don't move them unless we need to. When they need to be moved they get a trailer that is open inside and they lay down while we are moving.
[2015/11/12 12:34:03] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/12 12:34:47] <head8debian> Animals have very quiet and comfortable and lazy lives. :)
[2015/11/12 12:34:57] <Tobbi> Depends on the animal.
[2015/11/12 12:35:02] <head8debian> True.
[2015/11/12 12:35:07] <head8debian> Most domestic ones do.
[2015/11/12 12:35:14] <head8debian> Dairy animals mostly..
[2015/11/12 12:35:31] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do you know Kobe beef? Best beef there is.
[2015/11/12 12:35:38] <head8debian> Eat, sleep, poop, get milked, thats their life. :D

[2015/11/12 12:38:17] <brmbrmcar> I hate meat.
[2015/11/12 12:38:20] <Tobbi> about that subject.
[2015/11/12 12:38:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes, america fast paced...sadly.
[2015/11/12 12:38:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: What a coincidence. :p
[2015/11/12 12:38:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why coincidence?
[2015/11/12 12:39:04] <head8debian> You know nothing, yet he knows everything, yet you can call it by a name. ;)
[2015/11/12 12:39:09] <head8debian> nm...
[2015/11/12 12:39:27] <head8debian> Our family is much slower paced IMHO.
[2015/11/12 12:39:52] <brmbrmcar> Accelerator! Accelerator!
[2015/11/12 12:39:58] <head8debian> Its nice. :)
[2015/11/12 12:40:31] @ Quit: xet7: Quit: Leaving
[2015/11/12 12:42:23] <brmbrmcar> What is?
[2015/11/12 12:46:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzCf2RJHNSw
[2015/11/12 12:48:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: Is your police really that...strict?
[2015/11/12 12:52:21] <brmbrmcar> POLICE!!!
[2015/11/12 12:54:23] <brmbrmcar> Oh my god.
[2015/11/12 12:54:29] <brmbrmcar> That is bad.
[2015/11/12 12:55:27] @ alket joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/12 12:57:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, what did the motercyclist do in the last part?
[2015/11/12 12:58:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: I really don't know.
[2015/11/12 12:58:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Usually its about like the first half, maybe slightly more strict. We don't allow drag racing, and it is dangerous, especially on our roads.
[2015/11/12 12:58:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, I have to admit that I think it might be an unfair comparison.
[2015/11/12 12:58:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: He had to have done something pretty bad to have been treated like that.
[2015/11/12 12:58:46] <Tobbi> Probablz.
[2015/11/12 12:58:51] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2015/11/12 12:59:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, I got stopped by the police once. For going too fast. I was in quite a hurry...
[2015/11/12 12:59:21] <head8debian> Yes. We have accedentally once also.
[2015/11/12 12:59:26] <head8debian> And a couple flat tires.
[2015/11/12 12:59:48] <Tobbi> I needed to get dressed properly...and we had a choral concert... So, of course I was going 60 in a 30 speed limit zone.
[2015/11/12 12:59:50] <head8debian> Police are not mean over here, but im sure they can seem ruder than they are.
[2015/11/12 13:00:00] <head8debian> Yeah... ouch.
[2015/11/12 13:00:09] <Tobbi> So, I explained to the officer that I was in quite a hurry, and fortunately he didn't give me a ticket.
[2015/11/12 13:00:25] <head8debian> Ok, thats a easy let off. We get a warning. ;)
[2015/11/12 13:00:31] <head8debian> Then a ticket.
[2015/11/12 13:00:40] <brmbrmcar> I am scared of the US!
[2015/11/12 13:00:50] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Me too! :D
[2015/11/12 13:00:51] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/12 13:01:27] <brmbrmcar> All the death penalties!
[2015/11/12 13:01:34] <head8debian> But our police are not bad. If everyone else is going 75 and your going 77 you wont get pulled over...
[2015/11/12 13:01:37] <Tobbi> Oh, yeah, that...
[2015/11/12 13:01:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: In kph, please.
[2015/11/12 13:01:48] <brmbrmcar> I am glad I don't live there.
[2015/11/12 13:01:55] <brmbrmcar> No offence.
[2015/11/12 13:02:11] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Oh brother. There have not been many death offences in the US. Too few IMHO.
[2015/11/12 13:02:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm...
[2015/11/12 13:02:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't know KMph...
[2015/11/12 13:02:30] <Tobbi> okay...
[2015/11/12 13:02:51] <brmbrmcar> I do.
[2015/11/12 13:03:04] <head8debian> We feed some of these criminals their whole life through our taxes and they sit in jail and watch TV all day...
[2015/11/12 13:03:13] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/11/12 13:03:13] <brmbrmcar> 123 km/h
[2015/11/12 13:03:15] <Tobbi> "One of the shortest words in the German dictionary is RindfleischetikettierungsÃ¼berwachungsaufgabenÃ¼bertragungsgesetz, for example, which loosely means âNoâ."
[2015/11/12 13:03:18] <head8debian> Our jails are quite crowded atm.
[2015/11/12 13:03:29] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, are you for or against the death penalty?
[2015/11/12 13:03:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: Can you explain it better to me?
[2015/11/12 13:04:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: Explain what?
[2015/11/12 13:04:17] <head8debian> The death penalty. ;)
[2015/11/12 13:04:26] <head8debian> I don't hear much about it.
[2015/11/12 13:04:33] <head8debian> nm.
[2015/11/12 13:05:02] <head8debian> This is getting awkward...
[2015/11/12 13:05:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: Uhm, you're the one living in the US?
[2015/11/12 13:05:18] * head8debian also wonders why he has headphones on and is not listening to anything.
[2015/11/12 13:05:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do they have the death penalty in Michigan?
[2015/11/12 13:06:02] <leyyin> also Europe is the main cause a lot of states are abolishing the death penalty
[2015/11/12 13:06:19] <leyyin> because only Europe produces the drugs and we refuse to sell them anymore
[2015/11/12 13:06:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im not sure if death is the correct way to go, but i don't like it that we have so many people sitting in jail.
[2015/11/12 13:06:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: IIRC we don't.
[2015/11/12 13:06:29] <Tobbi> leyyin: Which is good!
[2015/11/12 13:06:33] <leyyin> Tobbi, agree
[2015/11/12 13:06:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: however, Texas apparently still gets their drugs from somewhere else...
[2015/11/12 13:06:55] <leyyin> Tobbi, ilegally
[2015/11/12 13:07:01] <Tobbi> Probably, yeah.
[2015/11/12 13:07:10] <leyyin> only Europe sells those drugs legally
[2015/11/12 13:07:14] <leyyin> "sold" :D
[2015/11/12 13:07:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: I believe Hospira even stopped producing Pentobarbital...
[2015/11/12 13:07:19] <head8debian> Of course illegally! They will get them weather you allow it or not. Its human nature.
[2015/11/12 13:07:24] <Tobbi> Or what it's called.
[2015/11/12 13:07:36] <head8debian> Sadly...
[2015/11/12 13:07:47] <leyyin> also, texas ;)
[2015/11/12 13:07:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's a government ffs. They have to abide by the law...
[2015/11/12 13:07:49] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/12 13:07:52] <leyyin> the hill billy country
[2015/11/12 13:07:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: I wouldn't want to live there.
[2015/11/12 13:08:23] <leyyin> me neither, you should avoid southern states in murica anyway
[2015/11/12 13:08:36] <leyyin> Florida especially :D
[2015/11/12 13:08:39] <Tobbi> leyyin: Still, I regularly search the news about death penalty. Morbid curiosity...
[2015/11/12 13:08:40] <head8debian> The Bible also says "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth", so i have always belived that that mean 'a life for a life'. But i do belive self defence is one exception.
[2015/11/12 13:08:59] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh, c'mon, please. That principle is what Texas goes by...
[2015/11/12 13:09:00] <leyyin> head8debian, are you jew?
[2015/11/12 13:09:13] <leyyin> only jews apply that law
[2015/11/12 13:09:16] <leyyin> christians do not
[2015/11/12 13:09:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: Society evolves.
[2015/11/12 13:09:21] <head8debian> They are trying to allow marajuanna(or how ever its written) up here.
[2015/11/12 13:09:25] <leyyin> because Jesus told us to love
[2015/11/12 13:09:34] <Tobbi> Marihuana...
[2015/11/12 13:09:43] <head8debian> leyyin: *real* christians do, "christians" don't.
[2015/11/12 13:09:49] <leyyin> "An Eye for an Eye Will Make the Whole World Blind"
[2015/11/12 13:09:55] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/12 13:10:19] <Tobbi> We're at that topic again (religion)
[2015/11/12 13:10:28] <leyyin> Tobbi, yes, you heathen ;)
[2015/11/12 13:10:34] <head8debian> I don't know why anyone considers themselves a Christian when they don't even trust the Bible.
[2015/11/12 13:10:40] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/12 13:10:46] <leyyin> head8debian, are you mad that Starbucks changed their cup?
[2015/11/12 13:10:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: I am not a heathen. I am baptized and confirmed.
[2015/11/12 13:11:17] <head8debian> leyyin: They did? I dont keep track of stuff like that.
[2015/11/12 13:11:24] <leyyin> Tobbi, obvious trying to get under your skin joke, captain obvious ;)
[2015/11/12 13:11:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Catholic? Baby baptised?

[2015/11/12 13:11:46] <head8debian> NO YOUTUBE VIDEOS!
[2015/11/12 13:11:47] <Tobbi> Who cares about religion anyway.
[2015/11/12 13:11:52] <leyyin> head8debian, why not?
[2015/11/12 13:12:06] <leyyin> I worked at youtube for 3 months ;)
[2015/11/12 13:12:17] @ head8debian left channel #supertux ("ttyl...")
[2015/11/12 13:12:29] <leyyin> he left because of me
[2015/11/12 13:12:31] <Tobbi> what?
[2015/11/12 13:12:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: I thought it was because of me.
[2015/11/12 13:12:36] <leyyin> ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED
[2015/11/12 13:12:46] <leyyin> Tobbi, do you want to fight over it?
[2015/11/12 13:12:50] * leyyin punches Tobbi 
[2015/11/12 13:12:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, got better stuff to do.
[2015/11/12 13:13:03] <Tobbi> I don't need violence to fight you, leyyin.
[2015/11/12 13:13:16] <Tobbi> Violence is bad anyway.
[2015/11/12 13:13:17] <Tobbi> I got my chainsaw always with me.
[2015/11/12 13:13:25] * leyyin runs
[2015/11/12 13:13:27] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:14:10] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, the problem with religion is that it's supposed to be a moral guidance, somewhat, but it often claims to be so much more.
[2015/11/12 13:14:28] <red_bot> /me chases tobbi with his chainsaw...
[2015/11/12 13:14:30] <Tobbi> And people who are really religious don't get that it's all open to interpretation and can be seen more or less strict.
[2015/11/12 13:14:35] <Tobbi> red_bot: Stop!
[2015/11/12 13:14:55] <red_bot> Tobbi: What? :p
[2015/11/12 13:15:16] <Tobbi> red_bot: If you want to be like brm brm car and pretend to ragequit only to read the logs...

[2015/11/12 13:17:21] <head8debian> I wanted to. :D
[2015/11/12 13:17:33] <leyyin> and why no youtube videos?

[2015/11/12 13:21:05] <head8debian> And take it as a compliment...

[2015/11/12 13:37:00] <brmbrmcar> Which is why diarrhoea has to be spelt diarrhea.
[2015/11/12 13:37:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do you like English?
[2015/11/12 13:37:18] <brmbrmcar> Which I hate.
[2015/11/12 13:37:30] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have grown to like it. It's really elegant.
[2015/11/12 13:37:35] <Tobbi> In a way.
[2015/11/12 13:37:37] <Karkus> Elegant?
[2015/11/12 13:37:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: The language flow is different...
[2015/11/12 13:37:51] <Karkus> It breaks all the rules all the time!?
[2015/11/12 13:38:00] <Tobbi> Karkus: But it sounds so...flowy...
[2015/11/12 13:38:01] <Karkus> German follows rules
[2015/11/12 13:38:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: In Britain everyone thinks german people sound angry
[2015/11/12 13:38:41] <brmbrmcar> I hate when they teach spelling rules for English that aren't ever right.
[2015/11/12 13:38:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: We don't only sound angry, we are angry. When we're not angry, we're not in any way conscious.
[2015/11/12 13:39:00] <brmbrmcar> I don't think German people sound amgry.
[2015/11/12 13:39:08] <Karkus> "'I' before 'E' except after 'C'"
[2015/11/12 13:39:10] <brmbrmcar> s/amgry/angry/
[2015/11/12 13:39:10] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "I don't think German people sound angry."
[2015/11/12 13:39:34] <brmbrmcar> I before E except after blank is better.
[2015/11/12 13:39:51] * head8debian rolls his eyes...

[2015/11/12 13:40:54] <brmbrmcar> Schoolis horrible.IRC school is not.
[2015/11/12 13:42:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: "I before E except after C? Is that an official rule? What about "riechen" then?
[2015/11/12 13:42:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's an english rule
[2015/11/12 13:42:25] <Tobbi> ah!
[2015/11/12 13:42:25] <Karkus> Reich?
[2015/11/12 13:42:35] <Tobbi> No, not rich.... riechen = to smell.
[2015/11/12 13:42:39] <head8debian> Yes, its a actual english rule. Helps with writing.
[2015/11/12 13:42:51] <Karkus> Weight? Height?

[2015/11/12 13:43:22] <Karkus> Food Poisoning = Lebensmittelvergiftung
[2015/11/12 13:43:25] <head8debian> How can you remember how to spell that?
[2015/11/12 13:43:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: Very good!
[2015/11/12 13:43:33] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:43:39] <Karkus> Transport links = Vehrkersverbindungen
[2015/11/12 13:43:45] <Karkus> If I spelled that right?
[2015/11/12 13:43:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: the "h" is at the wrong place.
[2015/11/12 13:43:53] <Karkus> Verkehr?
[2015/11/12 13:43:57] <Tobbi> Yes!
[2015/11/12 13:44:16] <Karkus> I haven't used either of those, ever
[2015/11/12 13:44:27] <Karkus> Hmmm, 'use'
[2015/11/12 13:44:29] <Tobbi> What a shame.
[2015/11/12 13:44:31] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:44:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I play Scrabble with my English lecturer at college every 2 weeks.
[2015/11/12 13:44:51] <brmbrmcar> brmbrmauto
[2015/11/12 13:44:52] <Tobbi> It's nice.
[2015/11/12 13:44:59] <Karkus> head8debian: If you can say it, you can spell it.
[2015/11/12 13:45:00] <head8debian> o-O
[2015/11/12 13:45:17] <head8debian> I haven no clue where to even begin pronouncing it.
[2015/11/12 13:45:36] <Karkus> Fer ker sfer bind ung en?
[2015/11/12 13:45:39] <brmbrmcar> Fer ker
[2015/11/12 13:45:43] <head8debian> I have enough issues pronouncing that oddball car dealer down the road's name.
[2015/11/12 13:45:48] <brmbrmcar> Karkus!

[2015/11/12 13:47:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: Wait, I showed you this before, right?
[2015/11/12 13:48:00] <head8debian> Karkus: Not sean it? ;p
[2015/11/12 13:48:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yepp
[2015/11/12 13:48:18] <head8debian> I still don't understand why sean is pronounced Shawn.
[2015/11/12 13:48:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, now something you might not have seen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaJtjJNrWf0

[2015/11/12 13:48:54] <head8debian> Karkus: How is that pronounced?
[2015/11/12 13:49:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: And it wasn't me who showed you that, right?
[2015/11/12 13:49:03] <Karkus> Sheh vawn
[2015/11/12 13:49:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Not this time, no

[2015/11/12 13:50:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't mind. Once I was told a story by a friend about something they did with their friend. Who happened to be me. -.-
[2015/11/12 13:50:09] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:51:11] <maths22> I'm working now on setting up OpenBuildService for the linux builds

[2015/11/12 13:53:04] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/12 13:53:48] <brmbrmcar> English is hard!
[2015/11/12 13:54:44] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So it's not your native language?
[2015/11/12 13:56:24] <brmbrmcar> It is.
[2015/11/12 13:57:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is Backpfeifengesicht a word?

[2015/11/12 13:58:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: You should rather not use it.
[2015/11/12 13:58:34] <Karkus> subtle is another stupid English spelling
[2015/11/12 13:58:35] <brmbrmcar> Longest word.

[2015/11/12 13:59:11] <brmbrmcar> But I would if talking about it.
[2015/11/12 13:59:37] <brmbrmcar> I know nothing about Titin.
[2015/11/12 14:00:06] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: its a protein, thats all i know.
[2015/11/12 14:00:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: What are the German views on the Second World War? Is it rude to talk about or make fun of it?
[2015/11/12 14:00:46] <Karkus> Specifically Germany
[2015/11/12 14:00:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's a really good question...I believe it's kind of a taboo subject here, still...
[2015/11/12 14:01:19] <Tobbi> We don't make fun of it.
[2015/11/12 14:01:34] <head8debian> We don't either.
[2015/11/12 14:01:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't mean in a disrespectful way.
[2015/11/12 14:01:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: Problem is: Because of the refugee crisis, the right-wing parties get more attration.
[2015/11/12 14:01:38] <head8debian> I don't think.
[2015/11/12 14:01:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's perfectly alright.
[2015/11/12 14:02:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, what about this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDeG4S-mJts

[2015/11/12 14:02:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, you got me. I find that funny.
[2015/11/12 14:02:21] <brmbrmcar> Only because of a few idiots who started a war.
[2015/11/12 14:02:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Hitler parodies are something different.
[2015/11/12 14:02:44] <Karkus> Tobbi: You've seen it already then? :P
[2015/11/12 14:02:52] <Tobbi> Karkus:  yeah ! :D

[2015/11/12 14:13:23] <Karkus> It's super easy to learn, takes a couple months to become fluent in it. (I've heard)
[2015/11/12 14:13:32] <Karkus> Very similar to Latin

[2015/11/12 14:16:21] <Karkus> leyyin: I guess that not many people are hipsters then.

[2015/11/12 14:17:49] <Tobbi> leyyin: Nerds learn Klingon.
[2015/11/12 14:18:38] <brmbrmcar> brmbrmcar language is like Linux. You get distrobutions of all major languages.
[2015/11/12 14:20:42] <brmbrmcar> Who wants to learn?

[2015/11/12 17:25:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not really...
[2015/11/12 17:25:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: But it's a religious song?
[2015/11/12 17:25:40] <Tobbi> or not?
[2015/11/12 17:26:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's one of the few songs I really like.
[2015/11/12 17:27:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not really my style... but part of our christmas playlist this year. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeaHAQklVVc&list=PLzGCPH8UWJzInF-XeNlDUZGvFjr0SWobt&index=3
[2015/11/12 17:27:32] <head8debian> I don't agree with all the lyrics in all of those songs, but meh. :p

[2015/11/12 19:01:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about you take over... :P Make language add-ons work after I tried unsuccessfully.
[2015/11/12 19:03:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did we actually ever decide on a proper release date?
[2015/11/12 19:09:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im thinking the day before christmas...
[2015/11/12 19:09:15] <head8debian> If thats possible.
[2015/11/12 19:09:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: But then people won't have that much time to see the new x-mas stuff.
[2015/11/12 19:09:31] <Tobbi> Actually, let me have a look.
[2015/11/12 19:10:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: True...
[2015/11/12 19:10:49] <head8debian> Tobbi: How about the 20th?
[2015/11/12 19:10:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: That could work.
[2015/11/12 19:11:00] <Tobbi> But, let's see...
[2015/11/12 19:11:37] <head8debian> Im afk. :)
[2015/11/12 19:12:21] <Tobbi> head8debian: SuperTux 0.3.1 was released on the 20th.
[2015/11/12 19:12:25] <Tobbi> So, maybe we should do that.
[2015/11/12 19:13:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Does this computer even look worth $45? http://www.asus.com/Notebooks/Eee_PC_1001PX_Seashell/
[2015/11/12 19:13:30] <head8debian> Used. 2gb ram.
[2015/11/12 19:14:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: I have no idea.
[2015/11/12 19:15:25] <head8debian> Hmm... A local school is gettign rid of a bunch of them.
[2015/11/12 19:29:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: But Windows 10 is such a hog that i don't think they would fare well on them.
[2015/11/12 19:29:39] <Tobbi> heh
[2015/11/12 19:30:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Google chrome is a hog as of recently also...
[2015/11/12 19:31:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: I see.
[2015/11/12 19:33:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: You haven't noticed? :)
[2015/11/12 19:33:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't use google chrome as much.
[2015/11/12 19:34:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot open more than 10 tabs now in chrome without filling up my ram and causing swap to kick in.
[2015/11/12 19:36:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Am i boring you?
[2015/11/12 19:36:17] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do you want me to be honest?
[2015/11/12 19:38:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes!
[2015/11/12 19:38:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Actually, as much as you write, you could become a wikipedia editor.
[2015/11/12 19:39:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: I've considered it. :-) If i got paid i might consider it.
[2015/11/12 19:39:33] <head8debian> further*
[2015/11/12 19:39:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why would you want to get paid?
[2015/11/12 19:40:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Wikipedia is a voluntary site. No one earns anything.
[2015/11/12 19:40:07] <Tobbi> Except Jimmy Wales.
[2015/11/12 19:40:10] <head8debian> I know. :-) It was a joke.
[2015/11/12 19:40:33] <head8debian> But for as much as we both type we could have huge websites with tons of info...
[2015/11/12 19:40:43] <head8debian> And this is the best ive gotten... :p

[2015/11/12 19:46:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't think i will buy any of those computers...
[2015/11/12 19:46:27] <head8debian> I honestly don't feel right trying to resell anything with less than 4gb of ram.
[2015/11/12 19:46:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Good thinking. I would suggest a Rechenschiebevorrichtung.
[2015/11/12 19:47:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Huh?
[2015/11/12 19:47:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: calculation shifting appliance.
[2015/11/12 19:47:34] <head8debian> _O

[2015/11/12 19:48:58] <Tobbi> Stop that.
[2015/11/12 19:49:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: LOL. Sorry. :-) Or is he becoming like me? :)
[2015/11/12 19:49:50] <Tobbi> head8debian: Or you two are the same person?

[2015/11/12 19:51:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Definately not.
[2015/11/12 19:51:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: good.
[2015/11/12 19:51:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: I should work on our wiki...
[2015/11/12 19:52:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, you should work on language add-on support.
[2015/11/12 19:52:19] <Tobbi> For some reason it won't work properly unless you restart...
[2015/11/12 19:52:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot code. We have been over this.
[2015/11/12 19:52:29] <head8debian> Uhm, at least it work?
[2015/11/12 19:52:31] <head8debian> works*
[2015/11/12 19:52:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yeah, it works...
[2015/11/12 19:52:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: You should really learn how to code.
[2015/11/12 19:54:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: I will learn a little when my Arduino gets here.
[2015/11/12 19:54:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, at least that's Python. Is it on its way?
[2015/11/12 19:54:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot even motivate myself to learn to program, how can i motivate myself to learn to code?
[2015/11/12 19:54:24] <Tobbi> Wait, is it python?
[2015/11/12 19:54:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Aren't those two things the same thing?
[2015/11/12 19:54:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: No. Its a hack up of C and C++
[2015/11/12 19:54:43] <Tobbi> Even better!
[2015/11/12 19:54:46] <head8debian> program a website**
[2015/11/12 19:55:02] <head8debian> Except my arduino was supposed to be here last week...
[2015/11/12 19:55:08] <head8debian> And still hasn't appeared.
[2015/11/12 19:55:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do you hate giving presentations as much as I do?
[2015/11/12 19:55:33] <head8debian> When i give one i will let you know. :-)
[2015/11/12 19:55:54] <Tobbi> heh...
[2015/11/12 19:56:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im getting more comfortable with speaking in front of people...
[2015/11/12 19:56:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: Well, actually it was worse when I was younger.
[2015/11/12 19:56:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: I speek in front of kids at church all the time, so how much harder can can grown ups be? :D
[2015/11/12 19:57:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: Kids are easier to integrate into a dishwasher than grownups. So there's that.
[2015/11/12 19:57:43] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/12 19:58:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: Have you ever tried to integrate kids into a dishwasher?
[2015/11/12 20:00:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: No.
[2015/11/12 20:00:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: Do you have some Cat5 that i can have?
[2015/11/12 20:00:43] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, I wouldn't be able to care about a cat.
[2015/11/12 20:00:44] <head8debian> I need a short piece.

[2015/11/13 06:42:50] <Tobbi> maths22, Also, the windows builds are missing SSLEAY32.dll and LIBEAY32.dll

[2015/11/13 08:39:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: Your IRC client did some smamming yesterday...
[2015/11/13 08:39:39] <head8debian> spamming*
[2015/11/13 08:39:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Really?
[2015/11/13 08:39:46] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/13 08:39:55] <leyyin> Tobbi, you should kick yourself
[2015/11/13 08:40:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't see it in the logs...
[2015/11/13 08:40:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: You left here thankfully.
[2015/11/13 08:40:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: try the #stk logs.
[2015/11/13 08:40:32] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/13 08:41:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: It was even more excessive in #secretchronicles... so i put a temporary ban on you in there.
[2015/11/13 08:41:07] <head8debian> Must have had internet issues.
[2015/11/13 08:41:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yeah, I should probably use a bouncer...
[2015/11/13 08:41:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: Why?
[2015/11/13 08:42:24] <Tobbi> I thought I had shutdown my computer.
[2015/11/13 08:42:47] <Tobbi> Well..
[2015/11/13 08:47:27] <Tobbi> head8debian: SuperTux 0.3.5a is now in homebrew-games
[2015/11/13 08:48:18] <leyyin> who uses mac anyways :P
[2015/11/13 08:48:34] <Tobbi> leyyin: Who uses Chromebooks, anyways? :P
[2015/11/13 08:48:42] <leyyin> not me ;)
[2015/11/13 08:48:57] <leyyin> I did not use one for almost 2 months
[2015/11/13 08:48:57] <Tobbi> leyyin: Maybe if I knew anything about computers, I would probably buy a different one.
[2015/11/13 08:53:57] <Tobbi> Okay, that is getting old, I have to admit.
[2015/11/13 08:55:09] * head8debian nods...
[2015/11/13 08:55:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: You don't need to buy a diferent one, you need to install Arch on your current one. :D
[2015/11/13 08:55:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: I'd rather not.
[2015/11/13 08:57:52] <leyyin> head8debian, everyone knows that arch is for peasants and gentoo is for gods ;)
[2015/11/13 08:58:42] <head8debian> Ok, debian? :D
[2015/11/13 08:58:53] <leyyin> debian is for plebs :P
[2015/11/13 08:59:04] <head8debian> Tobbi + ubuntu. Fits perfect. :p
[2015/11/13 08:59:11] <Tobbi> I tried ubuntu.
[2015/11/13 08:59:18] <head8debian> leyyin + gentoo, fits perfect.
[2015/11/13 08:59:18] <Tobbi> Didn't like it.
[2015/11/13 08:59:30] <head8debian> head8debian + gentoo. Pushing it too far.
[2015/11/13 08:59:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't blame you.
[2015/11/13 09:00:11] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its a broken OS IMHO.
[2015/11/13 09:09:32] <leyyin> os means bone in Romanian :P
[2015/11/13 09:09:41] <leyyin> get another os Tobbi
[2015/11/13 09:09:43] <leyyin> good boy
[2015/11/13 09:09:53] <Tobbi> leyyin: os is bone in Latin as well.
[2015/11/13 09:10:05] <leyyin> well yeah, we are latin people ;)

[2015/11/13 09:10:34] <leyyin> and fino-ugric people to the west :P
[2015/11/13 09:10:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: I don't know anything about languags :D
[2015/11/13 09:11:04] <Tobbi> *languages
[2015/11/13 09:11:17] <Tobbi> haha.
[2015/11/13 09:11:18] <Tobbi> Sorry.
[2015/11/13 09:11:54] <leyyin> well at least you know your language group, right?
[2015/11/13 09:12:41] <Tobbi> leyyin: Germanic? :P

[2015/11/13 09:14:35] <Tobbi> Despite me not knowing anything.
[2015/11/13 09:14:39] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/13 09:14:42] <Tobbi> maths22: Thanks.
[2015/11/13 09:14:47] <maths22> Also, I haven't yet integrated your recent changes into my branch, hence the wrong version number
[2015/11/13 09:15:02] <maths22> (It hasn't been rebuilt recently)
[2015/11/13 09:15:11] <Tobbi> Right!
[2015/11/13 09:15:14] <Tobbi> No problem.
[2015/11/13 09:15:46] <Tobbi> leyyin: I got a task for you: Find out why language packs only work properly after a restart...
[2015/11/13 09:16:02] <Tobbi> for SuperTux that is.
[2015/11/13 09:16:39] <leyyin> busy for STK :P
[2015/11/13 09:16:44] <leyyin> hiker is gonna kill me
[2015/11/13 09:16:56] <leyyin> Tobbi, what is your threat?
[2015/11/13 09:17:13] <Tobbi> leyyin: I can kill you as well? As you know, I got a chainsaw.
[2015/11/13 09:17:20] <Tobbi> Actually, make that two.
[2015/11/13 09:17:24] <leyyin> hiker has connections ;)
[2015/11/13 09:18:00] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/11/13 09:35:43] <maths22> By the way, what Linux distros should we be building for?
[2015/11/13 09:35:50] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/13 09:39:45] <Tobbi> hmm. let me check.
[2015/11/13 09:43:21] <head8debian> Uhm, every OS we can? :D
[2015/11/13 09:43:35] <head8debian> distro*
[2015/11/13 09:44:40] <maths22> Setting up each one takes a non-zero amount of effort
[2015/11/13 09:45:18] <maths22> Therefore, I want to figure out which ones we want so I can focus that effort on the more important distros/versions first
[2015/11/13 09:46:31] <head8debian> maths22: Good idea.
[2015/11/13 09:49:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: What do you think?
[2015/11/13 09:49:47] <Tobbi> think?
[2015/11/13 09:49:52] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/11/13 09:50:09] <Tobbi> I mean: Target most popular distros and be good with it.
[2015/11/13 09:50:45] <maths22> You can see which ones are currently working here: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:maths22:SuperTux/supertux2
[2015/11/13 09:54:33] <Tobbi> maths22: So, target those that work. The other ones, well, if you can, compile the missing deps yourself on those distros and use that.

[2015/11/13 10:49:17] <head8debian> And dirty results, if you know what i mean.

[2015/11/13 10:58:04] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: I don't think my goats have wifi way over there, or can type so well.
[2015/11/13 10:59:56] <brmbrmcar> They use superfast Goat internet.
[2015/11/13 11:00:03] <brmbrmcar> Faster than 5g.
[2015/11/13 11:00:24] <brmbrmcar> And can type at over 400 WPM.
[2015/11/13 11:00:41] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/13 11:02:29] <mt> maths22: well I'd suggest to get the build working on opensuse 13.2 and ubuntu 15.10 (what's the problem with the latter - libsdl2-*dev exists in the official package archives for wily and even xenial)
[2015/11/13 11:03:10] <mt> possibly also centos 7, but I'm not sure anybody's using that on a desktop system
[2015/11/13 11:03:16] <brmbrmcar> Goat internet costs 9999000$ a month.
[2015/11/13 11:05:08] <head8debian> Nobody i know is using centOS as a desktop OS.
[2015/11/13 11:05:20] <mt> if you need an Arch Linux PKGBUILD I can provide you one
[2015/11/13 11:05:25] <brmbrmcar> What is centOS?
[2015/11/13 11:05:32] <head8debian> maths22: Not opensuse 43 or whatever the latest release is?
[2015/11/13 11:05:37] <head8debian> mt: ^^
[2015/11/13 11:05:51] <head8debian> I can also provide one.
[2015/11/13 11:07:04] <mt> brmbrmcar: it's CentOS and it's a binary-compatible rebuild of the RedHat Enterprise Linux sources without proprietary RedHat logos etc.
[2015/11/13 11:08:52] <mt> head8debian: openSUSE Tumbleweed is the latest release for the build service, I'm unsure what this OS 42/43/whatever is supposed to be

[2015/11/13 11:56:07] <mt> Also, I'd sugggest you to use such a dynamic versioning using git commit number since first commit and git commit hash for the other packages
[2015/11/13 11:56:25] <mt> Since OBS provides a usable repository for package manager
[2015/11/13 11:56:27] <mt> s
[2015/11/13 11:57:34] <maths22> mt: I will fix the version numbers
[2015/11/13 11:57:42] <maths22> They will end up like git describe ones
[2015/11/13 11:57:57] <maths22> (latest tag + hash)
[2015/11/13 12:00:24] <mt> Yeah but be careful with the PKGBUILD because that won't really work (0.4.0.ae4ab9b will be considered a lower version than 0.4.0.bb0e3e1 in pacman)
[2015/11/13 12:00:50] <mt> I don't know how other systems will handle that
[2015/11/13 12:01:38] <maths22> this is why it is actually latest tag + num commits + hash
[2015/11/13 12:01:55] <maths22> i.e 1.0.4-14-g2414721
[2015/11/13 12:02:00] <mt> why do you write tag + hash then
[2015/11/13 12:02:11] <maths22> Because I wasn't thinking
[2015/11/13 12:02:47] <mt> and if you're already saying 1.0.4-14-g24...: pacman doesn't allow dashes in pkgver
[2015/11/13 12:04:31] <brmbrmcar> Nome of the buil;ds work for me.

[2015/11/13 12:11:54] <mt> Tobbi: is that even allowed under GPL/CC-BY-SA? Aren't you only allowed to charge the cost of distribution (which I'd say for savannah is none)?

[2015/11/13 12:12:25] <Tobbi> That's a good question. I thought it was...

[2015/11/13 12:12:37] <Tobbi> SA...share alike.
[2015/11/13 12:12:50] <Tobbi> Question is GPL
[2015/11/13 12:13:03] <Tobbi> I don't know.
[2015/11/13 12:13:45] <mt> well as seen in the picture it uses our images
[2015/11/13 12:14:21] <mt> so, ask a lawyer and then submit a DMCA takedown notice?

[2015/11/13 12:16:38] <head8debian> sue, sue!
[2015/11/13 12:16:39] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/13 12:16:42] <maths22> Since these are art assets, and not code, the application of the GPL to them is less than obvious
[2015/11/13 12:16:48] <maths22> Thus, a good question for a lawyer

[2015/11/13 12:18:10] <Tobbi> mt: The image are share-alike. So if he shares only those (allows them to be downloaded)...
[2015/11/13 12:18:32] <Tobbi> right?
[2015/11/13 12:18:50] <Tobbi> I don't really want to pay for a lawyer :D not for this project.
[2015/11/13 12:19:15] <mt> I think EFF or some other open source organization provides lawyers for projects
[2015/11/13 12:19:26] <maths22> Due to the fact that images are not code, not linked in code, etc, sharing the assets probably is enough for him
[2015/11/13 12:20:49] <Tobbi> I hope he attributes us...
[2015/11/13 12:20:53] <Tobbi> He has to...
[2015/11/13 12:21:43] <mt> "Although ReTux re-uses the art assets of SuperTux, no code from SuperTux is used in ReTux."
[2015/11/13 12:22:04] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/13 12:22:21] <Tobbi> Okay, I rather meant in-game as well.
[2015/11/13 12:22:42] <maths22> I believe it owuld simply need to be in the game distribution
[2015/11/13 12:22:58] <maths22> That is, in some LICENCE/LEGAL/CREDITS file distributed with the game
[2015/11/13 12:23:12] <Tobbi> Unfortunately we cannot check.
[2015/11/13 12:23:23] <Tobbi> Since there are no binary distributions available,
[2015/11/13 12:24:20] <maths22> If there is no binary distribution, then it is hard to violate the terms associated with a binary distrubtion
[2015/11/13 12:24:23] <Tobbi> Are any of the items under a CC-NC license?
[2015/11/13 12:25:06] <maths22> (That is, he can't be doing something wrong with a thing that he is has not created/shared)
[2015/11/13 12:25:43] <maths22> everything appears to be GPL or CC-BY-SA
[2015/11/13 12:26:06] <mt> Well, the art *has* to be attributed in any case, be it in the code or in a binary distribution
[2015/11/13 12:26:24] <mt> even if it'd just be CC-BY

[2015/11/13 12:37:43] <Tobbi> Does this guy indulge in getting on other people's nerves?

[2015/11/13 12:41:22] <Tobbi> Not sure.
[2015/11/13 12:42:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: I can give you a bouncer if you would really like.
[2015/11/13 12:42:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: I'd rather go for a proper one...
[2015/11/13 12:42:29] <Tobbi> Or I host it on my raspberry pi.
[2015/11/13 12:42:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/13 12:42:44] <head8debian> It is propper.
[2015/11/13 12:43:34] <Karkus> Regarding that freegamedev post, what if he's using the code from supertux too?
[2015/11/13 12:43:40] <Karkus> How could we ever know?
[2015/11/13 12:43:55] <Tobbi> We can't.
[2015/11/13 12:44:23] <Tobbi> That's actually a problem.
[2015/11/13 12:44:38] <Karkus> With the GPL in general
[2015/11/13 12:44:50] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/13 12:44:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: http://retux.nongnu.org/index.html this uses SuperTux images
[2015/11/13 12:44:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: I wonder if brmbrmcar is spying on us through the logs... they will refresh in 3 mins...

[2015/11/13 12:45:01] <Karkus> Speak of the devil
[2015/11/13 12:45:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: He PMed me and asked me why I kicked him.
[2015/11/13 12:45:07] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/13 12:45:13] <Tobbi> He told me his message wasn't coming through.
[2015/11/13 12:45:29] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Don't Ping people repeadedly.
[2015/11/13 12:45:30] <Tobbi> Not sure if his client was acting up or whether he was just getting on our nerves.
[2015/11/13 12:45:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: I think latter... my client never acts up...
[2015/11/13 12:45:50] <Tobbi> I still assume it's the latter but we can never know.
[2015/11/13 12:45:52] <Tobbi> hah
[2015/11/13 12:46:02] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: If there appears to be a problem, try reconnecting rather than resending the message
[2015/11/13 12:46:06] <head8debian> Ive never have had one act up either.
[2015/11/13 12:46:17] <brmbrmcar> I didn't know I sent it.
[2015/11/13 12:46:32] <brmbrmcar> After a while I just restarted.
[2015/11/13 12:46:35] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: mt told you to stop, what else could he have been referring to?
[2015/11/13 12:46:45] <brmbrmcar> I didn't see it.
[2015/11/13 12:46:53] <Karkus> head8debian: My experience with bad internet tells me that sometimes I send a message and see it in the client but it hasn't sent.
[2015/11/13 12:47:00] <Karkus> This could be the other way rounf
[2015/11/13 12:47:24] <maths22> I'm guessing the client stopped showing new messages
[2015/11/13 12:47:34] <maths22> Including those he sent
[2015/11/13 12:47:37] <Karkus> maths22: I'm guessing that too
[2015/11/13 12:48:00] <head8debian> Karkus: irssi tells me if its having trouble connecting to the server.
[2015/11/13 12:48:17] <Karkus> head8debian: After how long?
[2015/11/13 12:48:40] <Karkus> Hexchat takes a while to notice
[2015/11/13 12:49:15] <head8debian> Karkus: Usually a few seconds. Then it tells you when the last time it was able to contact the server.
[2015/11/13 12:49:24] <maths22> It sounds like a bug, not a network error
[2015/11/13 12:49:34] <brmbrmcar> The [#supertux] disappeared.
[2015/11/13 12:49:41] <Karkus> It doesn't matter what caused it.
[2015/11/13 12:49:44] <maths22> Given that he had to restart to fix it
[2015/11/13 12:49:54] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: What IRC client do you use now?
[2015/11/13 12:50:37] <brmbrmcar> irssi
[2015/11/13 12:51:19] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/13 12:51:41] <Karkus> HexChat is better :P
[2015/11/13 12:51:56] <head8debian> Karkus: :-)
[2015/11/13 12:52:03] <head8debian> User glitch... :p
[2015/11/13 12:52:17] <Karkus> head8debian: ?
[2015/11/13 12:52:42] <maths22> Irssi is certainly better-you can leave it running on a server 24/7
[2015/11/13 12:53:02] <maths22> I can't do that with hexchat
[2015/11/13 12:53:08] <Karkus> maths22: Why would you?
[2015/11/13 12:53:11] <Karkus> It's a gui
[2015/11/13 12:53:11] <brmbrmcar> And anyway, when I say the word "test", surely you must mean something has happened?
[2015/11/13 12:53:36] <maths22> I wouldn't
[2015/11/13 12:53:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: Not sure if you can help it, but: Would you know/be able to find out how to make tinygettext effectively re-read the dictionaries (currently, language add-ons still don't work properly until you restart)
[2015/11/13 12:54:15] <maths22> My point was that irssi is clearly superior because it is cli- based /s
[2015/11/13 12:54:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'll have a look. Doubt I'll be of any help D:
[2015/11/13 12:54:38] <Tobbi> No problem.
[2015/11/13 12:55:14] <Karkus> maths22: Superior for some things, but sometimes you just want a pretty GUI
[2015/11/13 12:55:16] <head8debian> Karkus: Irssi is running on a headless server for me.
[2015/11/13 12:55:29] <head8debian> The last couple days the server hasn't had the best uptime. :p
[2015/11/13 12:55:30] <Karkus> head8debian: Which is a good way to use it
[2015/11/13 12:55:42] <mt> weechat <3
[2015/11/13 12:55:43] <head8debian> Yes, thats why im "always" in IRC.
[2015/11/13 12:55:51] <mt> also command line + support for IRCv3
[2015/11/13 12:55:53] <Karkus> head8debian: I figured
[2015/11/13 12:56:29] <Karkus> head8debian: I did try irssi but I didn't like it, just my opinion :) Not the kind of thing I needed
[2015/11/13 12:56:30] <brmbrmcar> irssijust looks awesome
[2015/11/13 12:56:55] <maths22> I actually have irssi set up as a proxy too, so I can use native irc clients (on my phone) in the same session
[2015/11/13 12:56:58] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: No, it looks like it's cli based
[2015/11/13 12:57:32] <head8debian> maths22: I don't really care. Irssi does the job well, and according to you is not "broken".
[2015/11/13 12:57:53] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: What?
[2015/11/13 12:57:56] <head8debian> maths22: I just ssh into my server.
[2015/11/13 12:58:03] <head8debian> From my phone. :)

[2015/11/13 12:58:16] <maths22> Some days I do
[2015/11/13 12:58:16] <Karkus> Command Line... Interface?
[2015/11/13 12:58:19] <head8debian> I don't like phone IRC though.
[2015/11/13 12:58:29] * head8debian laughs...
[2015/11/13 12:58:55] <maths22> I mostly got tired of losing spell check and swype
[2015/11/13 12:58:56] <head8debian> Now we are sharing screenshots? :p
[2015/11/13 12:59:06] <head8debian> maths22: Ah.
[2015/11/13 12:59:39] <head8debian> Irssi + guake = awesome. :D
[2015/11/13 12:59:52] <maths22> mt: which os?
[2015/11/13 12:59:56] <head8debian> I have my irc client at the cue of a couple hotkeys.
[2015/11/13 13:00:11] <brmbrmcar> How did you get it lokoing like that?
[2015/11/13 13:00:17] <head8debian> That reminds me, i should change my desktop background.
[2015/11/13 13:00:28] <head8debian> Look like he has a 4k screen or something...
[2015/11/13 13:00:31] <mt> Arch Linux, bspwm, GTK and QT with the Arc theme + breeze icons
[2015/11/13 13:00:50] <mt> Terminal is gnome-terminal but I'm also using xfce4-terminal
[2015/11/13 13:01:17] <mt> tmux for as terminal multiplexer, weechat for IRC
[2015/11/13 13:01:57] <mt> and no 4K, it's a full HD 27" display
[2015/11/13 13:02:11] <head8debian> Oh, 2k then. :)
[2015/11/13 13:02:25] <head8debian> Yeah... thats huge.
[2015/11/13 13:02:29] <brmbrmcar> 32K
[2015/11/13 13:02:42] <brmbrmcar> 4K is horrible!
[2015/11/13 13:03:05] <brmbrmcar> 4K is just giant blocks of colour!
[2015/11/13 13:03:14] <head8debian> maths22: Why bspwm?
[2015/11/13 13:03:27] <head8debian> maths22: Arg. Sorry.
[2015/11/13 13:03:33] <head8debian> mt: Why bspwm?
[2015/11/13 13:03:53] <mt> because it like its configuration; it supports gaps etc.
[2015/11/13 13:04:05] <head8debian> Ah.

[2015/11/13 14:37:34] <mt> why not?
[2015/11/13 14:38:30] <brmbrmcar> Because it would be chaos.
[2015/11/13 14:39:09] <brmbrmcar> It is a game-wide thing.
[2015/11/13 14:40:26] <datahead8888> Does Super Tux only use one collision box/circle to detect both enemy hits and if Tux is standing on the ground, or does it use a second collision detection and/or line casting?  If it only uses one collision, how does it tell if he collided on top of an object?
[2015/11/13 14:45:09] <datahead8888> I needed to clean up my collision detection in another game and was curious about this in Super Tux, since Math Nerd referenced it when I asked him.
[2015/11/13 14:49:58] <Karkus> datahead8888: I don't understand your question, what's wrong with one collision box?
[2015/11/13 14:54:05] <datahead8888> I never said anything was wrong with it :)
[2015/11/13 14:54:11] <datahead8888> I just asked how Super Tux does it.
[2015/11/13 14:54:59] <datahead8888> In my own game, I have one circle collider plus, essentially, four smaller circle colliders on top, bottom, left, and right.  It is a mess, I think.
[2015/11/13 14:55:02] <Karkus> datahead8888: Then I don't understand your question :P
[2015/11/13 14:55:35] <brmbrmcar> Collision!
[2015/11/13 14:55:55] <datahead8888> Does Super Tux detect both Super Tux running into enemies and standing on the ground using only one collision box?  Is more than one collision box used?  Does it also use line casting for part of this?
[2015/11/13 14:56:20] <brmbrmcar> I have no idea.
[2015/11/13 14:56:28] <brmbrmcar> I think just the one.
[2015/11/13 14:56:41] <datahead8888> Okay, I got that impression from what Math Nerd said
[2015/11/13 14:57:09] <datahead8888> I'd be curious to know how it tells if Tux is standing on top of a collided object or is to the side, though
[2015/11/13 14:57:37] <Karkus> datahead8888: All I know is, we use collision boxes, and we have problems sometimes
[2015/11/13 14:57:52] <datahead8888> Yes, especially with slopes I've heard
[2015/11/13 14:57:53] <Karkus> datahead8888: Boxes are different
[2015/11/13 14:58:04] <Karkus> datahead8888: Correct
[2015/11/13 14:58:24] <brmbrmcar> I don't know, maybe with decimals and gradient stuff to tell it which side of box.
[2015/11/13 14:58:42] <datahead8888> Gradients?
[2015/11/13 14:58:50] <brmbrmcar> Yeah
[2015/11/13 14:59:08] <datahead8888> Some people have suggested I add line casting to a collision box in my game; is this what you mean?
[2015/11/13 14:59:30] <brmbrmcar> Idon't know.
[2015/11/13 14:59:40] <brmbrmcar> What is your game?
[2015/11/13 15:01:09] <datahead8888> It is a Unity 2D platformer/shooter
[2015/11/13 15:01:21] <datahead8888> I was just curious how Super Tux handled things for reference
[2015/11/13 15:02:05] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/13 15:02:21] <brmbrmcar> Ino nothing about collision based stuff.
[2015/11/13 15:02:38] <leyyin> maths22, `sudo: required` is the opposite of `sudo: false` ?
[2015/11/13 15:03:57] <maths22> leyyin: nope
[2015/11/13 15:04:07] <maths22> The opposite is just not including `sudo: false`
[2015/11/13 15:04:27] <leyyin> the opposite as sudo:falses always run on containters
[2015/11/13 15:04:35] <leyyin> sudo:required never run on containers
[2015/11/13 15:04:53] <leyyin> so they seem to be ;)
[2015/11/13 15:05:07] <maths22> What is wrong wtih containers if you don't need sudo?
[2015/11/13 15:05:29] <leyyin> I do not know
[2015/11/13 15:05:53] <maths22> Were you just asking for your curiosity?
[2015/11/13 15:06:17] <brmbrmcar> Run this command but allow it to do anything it wants to this computer!
[2015/11/13 15:06:17] <leyyin> well yes
[2015/11/13 15:06:26] <leyyin> I am testing something out for the stk-editor
[2015/11/13 15:06:43] <brmbrmcar> The stk-editor doesn't work!
[2015/11/13 15:06:59] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, how so?
[2015/11/13 15:07:05] <leyyin> open issue
[2015/11/13 15:07:41] <brmbrmcar> I selected the directory with the files in and nothing happened!
[2015/11/13 15:08:03] <leyyin> did you read the manual :D
[2015/11/13 15:08:03] <leyyin> ?
[2015/11/13 15:08:16] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/13 15:08:28] <brmbrmcar> And the first step failed!
[2015/11/13 15:08:46] <brmbrmcar> Does it neeed to be 0.9.x?
[2015/11/13 15:08:54] <Karkus> datahead8888: A Unity game is a bit difficult to compare to SuperTux
[2015/11/13 15:09:01] <leyyin> I will have to check it out later
[2015/11/13 15:09:12] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/13 15:09:53] <datahead8888> Karkus, yes, but some principles do not change
[2015/11/13 15:10:56] <brmbrmcar> sudo apt-get install unity
[2015/11/13 15:11:55] <maths22> brmbrmcar: glad to know you appreciate the Ubuntu desktop interface
[2015/11/13 15:12:14] <maths22> (That is what that command would actually install on an Ubuntu machine)
[2015/11/13 15:12:54] <brmbrmcar> I don't like the tracking.
[2015/11/13 15:13:23] <brmbrmcar> And all the social media stuff.
[2015/11/13 15:13:44] <leyyin> maths22, also, is there no cleaner way to install mac packages? checking with an if "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" = "osx" is ugly :D
[2015/11/13 15:13:51] <leyyin> in before_install
[2015/11/13 15:14:13] <maths22> leyyin: at this point in time, no
[2015/11/13 15:14:26] <maths22> Hopefully, travis adds support like they have for apt as a plugin
[2015/11/13 15:14:31] <leyyin> yes :D
[2015/11/13 15:14:33] <leyyin> brew:
[2015/11/13 15:14:34] <leyyin> like apt
[2015/11/13 15:14:43] <maths22> That would be nice
[2015/11/13 15:14:57] <maths22> That said, SuperTux previously had it as a manual apt-get command
[2015/11/13 15:15:03] <maths22> because the apt plugin is pretty new
[2015/11/13 15:15:17] <brmbrmcar> sudo apt-get install supertux
[2015/11/13 15:15:27] <brmbrmcar> apt-cache search supertux
[2015/11/13 15:16:24] <Karkus> datahead8888: Yeah, of course. If you do line collision for each line in the rect, then you'll get the side. Or there are other fun ways.
[2015/11/13 15:17:02] <brmbrmcar> Crash!
[2015/11/13 15:19:13] <datahead8888> brmbrmcar, crash?
[2015/11/13 15:19:39] <brmbrmcar> datahead888: CRASH!
[2015/11/13 15:19:43] <leyyin> the containers suck :D, only 2 threads, really
[2015/11/13 15:19:51] <brmbrmcar> FRontal! Side! Rear!
[2015/11/13 15:19:54] <maths22> By the way, with these automated builds, I'm thinking that we need to change the way we label dev builds
[2015/11/13 15:19:56] <brmbrmcar> Rollover!
[2015/11/13 15:20:29] <maths22> Basically, tools tend to mark dev builds as coming x amount after the previous release, not coming before the next one
[2015/11/13 15:20:30] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: What are you on about?
[2015/11/13 15:20:54] <brmbrmcar> Crashes!
[2015/11/13 15:21:03] <brmbrmcar> brm brm car crashes!
[2015/11/13 15:21:27] <maths22> Therefore, we are currently on v0.3.5-385-gf69dc07 (by Git's numbering)
[2015/11/13 15:22:34] <maths22> This also makes package numbering work
[2015/11/13 15:22:59] <maths22> Currently, using our labeling scheme, we are on 0.4.0-git-3ecf...
[2015/11/13 15:23:17] <maths22> That either is not well ordered or comes after 0.4.0, which is actually the final release
[2015/11/13 15:23:50] <datahead8888> I think someone likes cars
[2015/11/13 15:24:32] <maths22> datahead8888: I'm with you on that one
[2015/11/13 15:24:43] <brmbrmcar> brm brm cars!
[2015/11/13 15:25:36] <leyyin> the trusty machines are even slower :D
[2015/11/13 15:25:43] <datahead8888> brmbrmcar, you ought to make a car crashing gmae
[2015/11/13 15:25:44] <datahead8888> ***game
[2015/11/13 15:25:52] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/13 15:25:58] <datahead8888> Seriously
[2015/11/13 15:26:00] <datahead8888> :)
[2015/11/13 15:26:02] <brmbrmcar> With airbags.
[2015/11/13 15:26:11] <brmbrmcar> I will try...
[2015/11/13 15:26:18] <maths22> leyyin: building supertuxkart?
[2015/11/13 15:26:18] <datahead8888> You could get points for better crashes and set up safety devices in the car
[2015/11/13 15:26:30] <leyyin> maths22, no, the stk-editor
[2015/11/13 15:26:33] <datahead8888> Be sure to use a good physics engine
[2015/11/13 15:26:54] <brmbrmcar> It would have to be realistic.
[2015/11/13 15:27:04] <datahead8888> Yeah
[2015/11/13 15:27:05] <maths22> leyyin: how long is it taking?
[2015/11/13 15:27:15] <datahead8888> You could also send cars into compressors in your game
[2015/11/13 15:27:34] <datahead8888> Or drop them from airplanes
[2015/11/13 15:27:35] <leyyin> about 2 minutes on 12.04
[2015/11/13 15:27:40] <leyyin> about 4 on 14.04
[2015/11/13 15:28:48] <brmbrmcar> Front end damage cm = speed in kmh divided by overlap
[2015/11/13 15:29:27] <maths22> leyyin: still less long than I had to wait when setting up the supertux builds
[2015/11/13 15:29:44] <brmbrmcar> After 40cm half damage amounts per 40cm
[2015/11/13 15:29:49] <leyyin> on the old machines with 32 threads, under 1 minute
[2015/11/13 15:29:49] <maths22> And I think I made about 50 commits (and waited through at least 30 of them)
[2015/11/13 15:29:59] <maths22> leyyin: what machines?
[2015/11/13 15:30:10] <leyyin> the old infrastructure of travis
[2015/11/13 15:30:34] <leyyin> well I will squash the commits to be only one ;)
[2015/11/13 15:30:36] <maths22> leyyin: infrastructure they don't have anymore, or the non-container one?
[2015/11/13 15:30:43] <maths22> leyyin: I will do the same
[2015/11/13 15:30:50] <leyyin> the non-container one
[2015/11/13 15:30:51] <maths22> If git doesn't hate me too much
[2015/11/13 15:31:06] <maths22> leyyin: That's odd.  Those are supposed to have 1.5 cores each (I believe)
[2015/11/13 15:31:13] <maths22> 32 threads should not have run that well
[2015/11/13 15:31:31] <leyyin> well it does not run well for STK but for the editor :D
[2015/11/13 15:31:40] <leyyin> for STK it crashes gcc
[2015/11/13 15:31:43] <leyyin> out of memory
[2015/11/13 15:31:54] <maths22> on the old one or the new one?
[2015/11/13 15:31:56] <leyyin> with make -j 32
[2015/11/13 15:31:59] <leyyin> the old one
[2015/11/13 15:32:49] <maths22> leyyin: did it do that with a lower number of parallel jobs, or did it actually build
[2015/11/13 15:33:05] <maths22> Also, seee the table here: http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/
[2015/11/13 15:33:17] <leyyin> nproc tells me there are 32
[2015/11/13 15:34:06] <leyyin> for the editor it did build
[2015/11/13 15:34:33] <maths22> See http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/speeding-up-the-build/#Parallelizing-your-build-on-one-VM
[2015/11/13 15:34:39] <maths22> That is where I got the 1.5 number
[2015/11/13 15:34:46] <maths22> Maybe that is only the new infrastructure
[2015/11/13 15:39:37] <brmbrmcar> Side impact is harder!
[2015/11/13 15:42:26] <brmbrmcar> Weight to size ratio percent will change figures, but speed in kmh divided by 4.

[2015/11/13 16:14:34] <brmbrmcar> I reset .supertux2 and everything was fine.
[2015/11/13 16:14:58] <brmbrmcar> But it was the same version that was buggy before.

[2015/11/13 16:31:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could actually have something in the config which creates spritesheets from the files, couldn't we?

[2015/11/13 18:04:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe we're uploading po files to Transifex.
[2015/11/13 18:04:27] <Tobbi> Unfortunately I don't know the details.
[2015/11/13 18:04:31] <Tobbi> Ask giby when he gets back.
[2015/11/13 18:04:38] <Tobbi> or rather when he magically appears.
[2015/11/13 18:04:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, but are they all just added manually
[2015/11/13 18:05:06] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe currently they are.

[2015/11/14 14:25:08] <brmbrmcar> I checked status.github.com

[2015/11/14 14:31:56] <mt> so if https://github.com works something is wrong in your config
[2015/11/14 14:32:31] <brmbrmcar> git clone https://github.com/brmbrmcar/supertux.git
[2015/11/14 14:32:50] <mt> yeah

[2015/11/14 14:34:58] <mt> which file?
[2015/11/14 14:36:16] <mt> if you mean that: the size of a git repository is so much bigger than the actual content/source code because it keeps all history
[2015/11/14 14:36:41] <mt> it also downloads all history unless you specify a --depth
[2015/11/14 14:38:19] <brmbrmcar> It said everything was up to date when I pushed the changes.
[2015/11/14 14:38:38] @ bb010g joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/14 14:39:47] <mt> well obviously if you didn't push the squashed commit it won't know about that anymore after you deleted your local copy
[2015/11/14 14:40:15] <mt> now squash the commit, git push -f, and wait for the PR to get merged
[2015/11/14 14:40:48] <brmbrmcar> Oh no.

[2015/11/14 14:43:59] <brmbrmcar> case, please try git rebase (--continue | --abort | --skip)
[2015/11/14 14:43:59] <brmbrmcar> If that is not the case, please rm -fr "/home/brmbrmcar/supertux/.git/rebase-merge"

[2015/11/14 14:44:04] <brmbrmcar> valuable there.
[2015/11/14 14:44:23] <mt> well, git rebase --abort
[2015/11/14 14:44:27] <mt> I'd suggest
[2015/11/14 14:44:49] <mt> then `git rebase -i HEAD~2`
[2015/11/14 14:44:50] <brmbrmcar> I did it.
[2015/11/14 14:45:02] <brmbrmcar> And the commits have gone again!
[2015/11/14 14:45:17] <mt> well, so you didn't rebase -i ... yet?
[2015/11/14 14:45:26] <mt> then git reset --hard ... again
[2015/11/14 14:45:34] <mt> then git rebase -i ...
[2015/11/14 14:46:05] <mt> and in the editor coming up, change the 'pick' in front of 'ce83bfc' to 'squash'
[2015/11/14 14:46:09] <mt> then save + close
[2015/11/14 14:46:42] <mt> in the new editor window, set a commit message for the squashed commit
[2015/11/14 14:46:46] <mt> save+close again
[2015/11/14 14:46:53] <mt> -> you're done

[2015/11/14 14:48:17] <brmbrmcar> I did all that, but it still says everything is up to date.
[2015/11/14 14:48:37] <mt> paste `git log --oneline | head -n 10`

There is quite a social division, which results in extremist views emerging as people do not feel like they are part of the community.

[2015/11/14 16:29:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: Wasn't it the IS who planned that?
[2015/11/14 16:29:29] <Tobbi> So, they still originated from within france?
[2015/11/14 16:29:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah
[2015/11/14 16:29:36] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2015/11/14 16:29:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Probably
[2015/11/14 16:30:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe if something like that would've happened in Germany... we wouldn't be well prepared either.
[2015/11/14 16:31:02] <brmbrmcar> Scary!
[2015/11/14 16:31:39] <brmbrmcar> Bomb/bullet proof brm brm car
[2015/11/14 16:35:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: You know you got that email from that Google head hunter right? What happened then? I think Google is really cool :P
[2015/11/14 16:35:30] <Tobbi> Karkus: I told him that I'd be thrilled, and sent him my CV.
[2015/11/14 16:35:35] <Tobbi> He forwarded that to the European guys.
[2015/11/14 16:35:42] <Tobbi> He originally thought I was from the US.
[2015/11/14 16:35:51] <Tobbi> And apparently the European guys didn't have any openings for me.
[2015/11/14 16:36:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, right D:
[2015/11/14 16:36:00] <Tobbi> I wonder whether my CV was wrong.
[2015/11/14 16:36:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I listed all programming languages I know even remotely...
[2015/11/14 16:36:17] <Tobbi> Maybe that was wrong.
[2015/11/14 16:36:31] <Tobbi> But I was so excited and wanted to give a good impression...
[2015/11/14 16:36:33] <Tobbi> So, yeah.
[2015/11/14 16:37:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: Probably just bad timing...
[2015/11/14 16:37:14] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2015/11/14 16:37:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, some people I talked to told me to try again. I might.
[2015/11/14 16:37:49] <brmbrmcar> What about brmbrmcar programming language? You just type things in and nothing happens.
[2015/11/14 16:37:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: You should. What do you have to lose by sending off an email?
[2015/11/14 16:37:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's true.
[2015/11/14 16:38:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: But it's weird that "Google applies with you for a job" :D
[2015/11/14 16:38:28] <Tobbi> Normally, it's the other way round.
[2015/11/14 16:39:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: They want the best of the best, so they search everywhere
[2015/11/14 16:39:18] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2015/11/14 16:39:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: But if they didn't take me that means I am not the best of the best.
[2015/11/14 16:39:35] <Karkus> Depending on where I head in the future, I might try to apply there
[2015/11/14 16:39:43] <Tobbi> So, maybe it doesn't make sense to apply again.
[2015/11/14 16:39:49] <brmbrmcar> Google is wierd.
[2015/11/14 16:40:07] <brmbrmcar> Google is not monopoly.
[2015/11/14 16:40:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: They might not have been looking for many applicants then
[2015/11/14 16:40:22] <Tobbi> Probably not.
[2015/11/14 16:40:29] <Tobbi> Still, I am not sure if I want to work at Google.
[2015/11/14 16:40:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: As you said, the guy who headhunted you thought you were American
[2015/11/14 16:40:52] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/11/14 16:41:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why ever not?
[2015/11/14 16:41:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, if you strip all the benefits off Google, at the end of the day, it's still a job.
[2015/11/14 16:41:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: The benefits are potentially tempting for me.
[2015/11/14 16:41:52] <brmbrmcar> I want to compete with Google.
[2015/11/14 16:41:54] <Tobbi> So, I might get more inclined to take a job at Google without looking for possibly better suiting alternatives.
[2015/11/14 16:42:00] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Compete with yourself, first.
[2015/11/14 16:42:08] <Tobbi> *better-suited
[2015/11/14 16:42:25] <brmbrmcar> I want to make software for driverless brm brm cars!
[2015/11/14 16:42:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Google is a nice environment, supposedly
[2015/11/14 16:43:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's made that way to make you productive.
[2015/11/14 16:43:21] <Tobbi> I assume.
[2015/11/14 16:43:40] <Karkus> Yeah
[2015/11/14 16:43:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, of course I am looking for prestige in my life and want everyone to think I am something special. And that's why it's so tempting to apply again.
[2015/11/14 16:44:08] <Tobbi> And that's why I want to think twice before doing so. I know my weaknesses. And prestige and money are two of them.
[2015/11/14 16:44:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: You don't have to work somewhere special to be special. You have to do something special
[2015/11/14 16:44:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: Money and prestige...
[2015/11/14 16:44:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know. But what I really want is come to terms with myself.
[2015/11/14 16:45:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: The thing I find enticing about Google is the 20% time.
[2015/11/14 16:45:33] <Tobbi> 20% to work on your own projects?
[2015/11/14 16:45:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Also, Google love people who work on open source projects
[2015/11/14 16:45:46] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/11/14 16:45:47] <Tobbi> right
[2015/11/14 16:45:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: As long as it has something to do with Google
[2015/11/14 16:46:01] <brmbrmcar> And no Google's rubbish that causes high speed crashes

[2015/11/15 07:55:59] <brmbrmcar> Any idea how to fight conflicting poackages without removing anythging?
[2015/11/15 07:56:13] <Karkus> conflicting packages???
[2015/11/15 07:56:33] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/15 07:56:42] <brmbrmcar> I can't build 0.0.6.
[2015/11/15 07:56:52] <Karkus> What's conflicting?
[2015/11/15 07:56:53] <brmbrmcar> So I am using a .deb file.
[2015/11/15 07:57:08] <brmbrmcar> Supertux 0.0.6 and supertux-stable
[2015/11/15 08:00:45] <Karkus> No, I have no idea :(
[2015/11/15 08:02:45] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/15 08:03:08] <brmbrmcar> I amtrying to create a Console command for MNID_RESETLEVEL.
[2015/11/15 08:03:22] <brmbrmcar> But I have no idea how to.
[2015/11/15 08:04:43] <Karkus> You want a console command which resets the level?
[2015/11/15 08:05:07] <Karkus> brmbrmcar:^
[2015/11/15 08:05:17] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/15 08:05:35] <brmbrmcar> I want a console command for a lot of things.
[2015/11/15 08:07:09] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Make an issue with all the commands you want
[2015/11/15 08:07:14] <brmbrmcar> K.
[2015/11/15 08:07:24] <brmbrmcar> But I will implement themall.
[2015/11/15 08:08:02] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: If you make an issue, we will be able to see what's going on, and help you :)
[2015/11/15 08:09:04] <brmbrmcar> Where?
[2015/11/15 08:09:08] <brmbrmcar> OnGithub?
[2015/11/15 08:10:46] <Karkus> Yes please

[2015/11/15 08:27:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: IPC with SuperTux might be difficult, though.
[2015/11/15 08:27:20] <Tobbi> IPC = Inter Process Communication.
[2015/11/15 08:27:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I didn't say it would be easy, or possible
[2015/11/15 08:27:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: ik
[2015/11/15 08:27:33] <Tobbi> It'd need a server that could run and get the commands.
[2015/11/15 08:27:42] <Tobbi> You know, run in the background.
[2015/11/15 08:27:54] <Tobbi> We could make that dependent on the developer switch.
[2015/11/15 08:28:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: So we would use sockets?

[2015/11/15 09:05:01] <Karkus> grumbel: My plans are to make it better than the current editor, and more portable
[2015/11/15 09:05:42] <Karkus> grumbel: https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/issues
[2015/11/15 09:07:45] <Karkus> grumbel: Tobbi had issues getting the current editor to work on Mac OSX, and we need an editor which will stay updated as the game does

[2015/11/15 09:21:55] <grumbel> Karkus: looks fine so far
[2015/11/15 09:23:11] <Tobbi> I really wonder whether the latest glbinding would work with SuperTux.
[2015/11/15 09:23:55] <Karkus> grumbel: I've also thought about a plugin API
[2015/11/15 09:26:28] <Karkus> grumbel: And IPC so the editor can affect what happens more than just by passing arguments
[2015/11/15 09:27:22] <grumbel> sounds like overkill
[2015/11/15 09:28:53] <Karkus> grumbel: Why? I want a tux object for the player to move and then he spawns there
[2015/11/15 09:29:07] <Karkus> I want a lot of things :P
[2015/11/15 09:29:15] <grumbel> ./supertux levelname.stl --start-pos x,y
[2015/11/15 09:30:08] <grumbel> I'd prefer something simple that actually works, then some pie-in-the-sky thing that never gets finished and makes portability harder
[2015/11/15 09:30:33] <Karkus> grumbel: Yeah, I see what you mean
[2015/11/15 09:31:18] <grumbel> I would focus on basic stuff, i.e. add auto-smoothing to the tile painting
[2015/11/15 09:31:29] <Karkus> auto smoothing?
[2015/11/15 09:31:54] <grumbel> automatically painting the edge tiles so you don't have to do that manually
[2015/11/15 09:32:08] <grumbel> the C# has a function for that, but it's not that great there either
[2015/11/15 09:32:12] <Karkus> Oh, yeah I thought about that too :)
[2015/11/15 09:32:19] <Tobbi> I wonder how we'd go about doing that... It needs to be simple.
[2015/11/15 09:32:33] <Karkus> What about slopes?
[2015/11/15 09:33:17] <grumbel> Has anybody played with the SuperMarioMaker thing on WiiU?
[2015/11/15 09:33:27] <Karkus> grumbel: Yup :)
[2015/11/15 09:33:47] <Karkus> grumbel: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/103
[2015/11/15 09:34:28] <Karkus> That kind of gameplay could exist like the old 0.1.x editor
[2015/11/15 09:34:54] <Tobbi> I still think that supertux's UI isn't the best choice for this kind of advanced editor.
[2015/11/15 09:37:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's why I want to continue with Flexlay
[2015/11/15 09:37:14] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/11/15 09:37:28] <grumbel> Tobbi: it wouldn't need to be advanced, just something that lets people build levels easily
[2015/11/15 09:37:37] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/11/15 09:39:18] <Karkus> grumbel: Also, there are a few files (including everything in flexlay/wip, flexlay/[canvas, brush, brushmask].py etc.) which I don't understand the intended purpose of, and cannot find any information on what needs doing
[2015/11/15 09:39:21] <Tobbi> grumbel: By the way: After removing directories from tinygettext and rebuilding the cache, how would I go about refreshing the UI?
[2015/11/15 09:41:28] <grumbel> Karkus: Those are classes from the C++ code that haven't been ported over yet
[2015/11/15 09:41:45] <grumbel> Karkus: the Python editor is basically a 1:1 translation of the C++ code
[2015/11/15 09:44:38] <grumbel> Karkus: http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/flexlaypaint8.png
[2015/11/15 09:44:45] <Karkus> grumbel: Okay, I will look into that
[2015/11/15 09:44:52] <grumbel> flexlay used to have some drawing functionality
[2015/11/15 09:45:25] <grumbel> Canvas was the pixel buffer, brush and brushmask where the brushes you could draw into that pixel buffer
[2015/11/15 09:45:33] <Tobbi> I guess I will just display a message to please restart the game after installing language packs.
[2015/11/15 09:45:42] <grumbel> can be ignored for the moment, it's not really needed for supertux
[2015/11/15 09:46:50] <grumbel> something different: I cleaned up the lisp parser code and optimized it a bit: https://github.com/lispparser/sexp-cpp
[2015/11/15 09:47:21] <Tobbi> grumbel: Can you do a pull request against the SuperTux repo?
[2015/11/15 09:47:55] <Karkus> grumbel: Can I move the canvas files etc. into wip/ so they're out of the way?
[2015/11/15 09:48:06] <Karkus> Or onto a different branch?
[2015/11/15 09:48:54] <grumbel> Karkus: put them in wip/
[2015/11/15 09:49:31] <grumbel> Tobbi: will need some further work to integrate, I'll send a push request one day
[2015/11/15 09:49:39] <Tobbi> Thanks.
[2015/11/15 09:55:58] <grumbel> Tobbi: about refreshing the GUI with new translation, easiest would be to restart the main loop, i.e. the part in Main::launch_game()
[2015/11/15 09:56:12] <Tobbi> grumbel: But doing so from the UI?
[2015/11/15 09:56:40] <grumbel> Tobbi: maybe throw a TranslationUpdated exception or something like that?
[2015/11/15 09:56:53] <Tobbi> I could do that, actually.
[2015/11/15 09:56:55] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2015/11/15 10:00:32] <Tobbi> Actually, if I pop the screen, then push a new TitleScreen, this could work.
[2015/11/15 10:05:39] <Karkus> grumbel: Was the auto-smoothing a different tool?
[2015/11/15 10:06:25] <grumbel> Karkus: flexlay never really had auto-smoothing (other then some experimental script that never worked well)
[2015/11/15 10:06:40] <Karkus> grumbel: Well, what do you want then?
[2015/11/15 10:07:58] <grumbel> A tile tool that lets me select "snow" tiles and then paint them around while auto-smoothing the edges
[2015/11/15 10:08:58] <grumbel> The C# smoothing tool is a separate tool that you use to smooth out the tiles after you have painted them
[2015/11/15 10:09:27] <grumbel> It sort of works and could be ported over to Flexlay, but it's not quite as easy to use as I would like
[2015/11/15 10:09:54] <grumbel> The tricky part is that a lot of tilemaps in SuperTux aren't conceptually clean
[2015/11/15 10:10:00] <Tobbi> I was also thinking of a scenery creation tool that allows you to select different slopes and place them, and it'll automatically create a smooth scenery.
[2015/11/15 10:10:51] <grumbel> i.e. you might have tiles spread over different layers and such or special tiles that still look like other tiles
[2015/11/15 10:12:25] <grumbel> not sure how to deal with slopes, in flexlay/netpanzer-editor I had the ability to flatten/unflatten groups of tiles into objects
[2015/11/15 10:12:38] <grumbel> http://www.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/flexlay/images/netpanzer-1.jpg
[2015/11/15 10:12:39] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 272 seconds
[2015/11/15 10:12:56] <grumbel> that might work with slopes as well
[2015/11/15 10:13:39] <grumbel> are there any editors out there that deal with slopes well?

[2015/11/15 10:22:34] <Tobbi> hrm, restarting the main loop doesn't want to work.
[2015/11/15 10:22:52] <Tobbi> I mean: Clearly it works, but it doesn't fix the problem.
[2015/11/15 10:23:10] <Tobbi> I tried clearing the menu stack which won't work either.
[2015/11/15 10:25:17] <grumbel> Tobbi: MenuManager needs to be recreated
[2015/11/15 10:25:30] <Tobbi> Alright...
[2015/11/15 10:25:43] <Tobbi> grumbel: Can't I do that without restarting the main loop?
[2015/11/15 10:26:23] <grumbel> MenuManager is part of ScreenManager
[2015/11/15 10:27:01] <grumbel> Maybe, but I don't now where all the strings are hiding

[2015/11/15 10:53:11] <Tobbi> Not that I expected it to work.

[2015/11/15 10:55:24] <Tobbi> I give up for now.
[2015/11/15 10:56:07] <Tobbi> I even tried to restart the main loop which didn't work either.
[2015/11/15 10:57:40] <Karkus> Why do you need to refresh the menu?
[2015/11/15 10:58:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: Because otherwise it won't pick up new translations...
[2015/11/15 10:58:11] <Karkus> When you change language normally it works though...
[2015/11/15 10:58:19] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/11/15 10:58:22] <Tobbi> that's true...
[2015/11/15 10:58:26] <Tobbi> Let me check something.
[2015/11/15 10:58:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: It puts you back to the first (main) menu
[2015/11/15 10:59:01] <Tobbi> Yeah.

[2015/11/15 12:07:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: You can't activate the switch in edit mode
[2015/11/15 12:07:51] <mt> head8debian: there's the official docs and #arduino
[2015/11/15 12:07:53] <Tobbi> Karkus: If you press Action, it returns...
[2015/11/15 12:07:55] <brmbrmcar> Press action.
[2015/11/15 12:08:00] <Tobbi> And then press the switch.

[2015/11/15 12:08:26] <brmbrmcar> Can you not read the infoblock?
[2015/11/15 12:08:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: I updated the testcase.
[2015/11/15 12:08:51] <Tobbi> Just activate the switch and it should crash.
[2015/11/15 12:11:41] <Tobbi> Actually...
[2015/11/15 12:12:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: How do I press the switch in edit mode?
[2015/11/15 12:12:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: Press action key (left ctrl key for me)
[2015/11/15 12:13:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah, okay
[2015/11/15 12:13:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, let me try in the console
[2015/11/15 12:13:57] <Tobbi> I believe that works.
[2015/11/15 12:14:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, it doesn't crash?
[2015/11/15 12:14:20] <Tobbi> I believe so.
[2015/11/15 12:14:31] <brmbrmcar> The console does not crash it.
[2015/11/15 12:14:59] <Karkus> What does the action key actually do while in edit mode?
[2015/11/15 12:15:15] <brmbrmcar> Let Tux move again.
[2015/11/15 12:17:49] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Turn edit mode off?
[2015/11/15 12:22:14] <Karkus> Okay, I believe I understand the issue now
[2015/11/15 12:24:09] <Tobbi> I am having trouble finding the cause of this.
[2015/11/15 12:28:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: I have no idea where to look :/
[2015/11/15 12:28:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe this might be some issue inside Squirrel...
[2015/11/15 12:29:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is Level.edit already set to false by pressing the action key?
[2015/11/15 12:29:08] <Tobbi> Probably?
[2015/11/15 12:29:26] <Tobbi> Actually, we could circumvent this, probably.
[2015/11/15 12:30:27] <Karkus> http://squirrel-lang.org/ works for me now
[2015/11/15 12:35:29] <Tobbi> I don't understand the issue at all.
[2015/11/15 12:36:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: Also, try restarting the level after pressing the action key while in edit mode.
[2015/11/15 12:36:23] <Tobbi> ok.
[2015/11/15 12:36:57] <Karkus> Actually, that's probably intended behaviour
[2015/11/15 12:37:21] <Karkus> Well, probably not.
[2015/11/15 12:37:34] <Tobbi> So, apparently we are still in edit mode.
[2015/11/15 12:38:33] <Karkus> Yup.
[2015/11/15 12:48:50] <grumbel> Tobbi: https://github.com/SuperTux/tinygettext/commit/d0155106c9b770f7ff28070c60f39337f12e8f47 there is no need to #ifdef that stuff out, all log callbacks are configurable

[2015/11/15 15:00:09] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: This has nothing to do with anything. This adds 1 line which isn't even code.
[2015/11/15 15:00:19] <brmbrmcar> And you forgot ci skip!
[2015/11/15 15:00:26] <Karkus> I did :(
[2015/11/15 15:00:38] <brmbrmcar> I do exactly the same.
[2015/11/15 15:00:50] <brmbrmcar> All my commits were useless.
[2015/11/15 15:01:30] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Talking about useless commits, what exactly does https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/220 do?
[2015/11/15 15:02:39] <brmbrmcar> Make Tux invincible (like when he gets a star).

[2015/11/15 15:04:41] <datahead7777> Karkus, grumbel was in, several people were talking, I saw Travis messages, etc.  head 8 debian had already said it was busy, and I agreed
[2015/11/15 15:04:53] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: But sector.Tux.make_invincible(true) does that
[2015/11/15 15:05:03] <maths22> Karkus: it will actually work on every push
[2015/11/15 15:05:12] <Karkus> datahead7777: I suppose it's more active than usual
[2015/11/15 15:05:25] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: But we need shortcuts.
[2015/11/15 15:05:26] <Karkus> maths22: To your repo?
[2015/11/15 15:05:37] <maths22> Right now
[2015/11/15 15:05:41] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: I don't know about that
[2015/11/15 15:05:53] <maths22> The idea is that it will be switched to run off of the offical
[2015/11/15 15:06:04] * maths22 hit enter too soon
[2015/11/15 15:06:08] <Karkus> maths22: Why can't we do that now?
[2015/11/15 15:06:12] <brmbrmcar> Like fire(), ice(), air() earth(), growup()
[2015/11/15 15:06:27] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Okay
[2015/11/15 15:06:31] <Karkus> Let me see
[2015/11/15 15:06:53] <maths22> Karkus: because certain aspects don't work quite right yet, and (mostly for windows) several things need to be changed besides .travis.yml
[2015/11/15 15:07:00] <brmbrmcar> invincible() was actually a full script,but it is so short...
[2015/11/15 15:07:06] <Karkus> maths22: Oh, I see
[2015/11/15 15:07:10] <maths22> I want to make sure everything works right before we merge
[2015/11/15 15:07:43] <brmbrmcar> Will tinygettext be in there?

[2015/11/15 15:10:04] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: I don't understand... what's wrong with invincible()
[2015/11/15 15:10:20] <brmbrmcar> It runs in a loop.
[2015/11/15 15:10:31] <Karkus> which one?
[2015/11/15 15:10:46] <brmbrmcar> invincible()
[2015/11/15 15:12:43] <brmbrmcar> The coin limit needs to be increased.
[2015/11/15 15:18:37] <maths22> brmbrmcar: what about tinygettext
[2015/11/15 15:18:46] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Also, what coin limit
[2015/11/15 15:19:04] * maths22 forgets that question marks are a thing
[2015/11/15 15:21:29] <brmbrmcar> Will sudo dpkg -i work straight away.
[2015/11/15 15:22:12] <brmbrmcar> THe coin limit is too low; I reached it without cheating.

[2015/11/15 15:29:16] <Tobbi> Actually, guys, there have been quite a few levels that were removed from bonus island 3 but never added somewhere else ;)
[2015/11/15 15:30:05] <brmbrmcar> Which ones?
[2015/11/15 15:31:26] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: A lot of them.
[2015/11/15 15:31:27] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/15 15:32:21] <Tobbi> Take a look at https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/levels/bonus3/changelog.txt
[2015/11/15 15:32:28] <brmbrmcar> There needs to be more target times.
[2015/11/15 15:33:25] <brmbrmcar> For Icy Island.
[2015/11/15 15:34:35] <brmbrmcar> And in Two Tiny Towers, dispensers need to be changed from auto to left.

[2015/11/15 15:47:12] <maths22> brmbrmcar: What is the coin limit?
[2015/11/15 15:47:46] <maths22> Also, if you mean will dpkg -i install tinygettext, the answer is yes
[2015/11/15 15:48:24] <brmbrmcar> 9999
[2015/11/15 15:51:00] <maths22> brmbrmcar: OK
[2015/11/15 15:51:11] <brmbrmcar> Which is too low.
[2015/11/15 15:51:14] <maths22> I'll have to work on hitting it sometime
[2015/11/15 15:51:19] <maths22> (No checkpoints for me)
[2015/11/15 15:51:27] <brmbrmcar> Where ist this set?
[2015/11/15 15:56:40] <brmbrmcar> I have changed in brmbrmcar:coins
[2015/11/15 16:11:58] <head8debian> Tobbi: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/1105f486/
[2015/11/15 16:12:14] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I think the better question to ask is: why do we have a coin limit?
[2015/11/15 16:12:36] <maths22> Is there a reason to keep it and increase it, or should it be eliminated?
[2015/11/15 16:12:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: does it work?
[2015/11/15 16:12:56] <maths22> head8debian: what is that for?
[2015/11/15 16:13:14] <brmbrmcar> To stop cheats.
[2015/11/15 16:13:32] <maths22> What kind of cheats does it stop?
[2015/11/15 16:14:05] <brmbrmcar> I don't know, someone who wants a load of checkpoints.
[2015/11/15 16:14:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't have the resistors for my photocells, so i don't know... :-/
[2015/11/15 16:14:19] <head8debian> maths22: An arduino.
[2015/11/15 16:14:22] <brmbrmcar> But we should let that happen anyway.
[2015/11/15 16:14:33] <head8debian> I honestly hope it will work.
[2015/11/15 16:14:36] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/15 16:14:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: I want to *sigh* also...
[2015/11/15 16:15:09] <maths22> brmbrmcar: with the console, you can already cheat in whatever way you want
[2015/11/15 16:15:11] <brmbrmcar> *bold*
[2015/11/15 16:15:17] <head8debian> Its taken alot of my energy trying to come up with that...
[2015/11/15 16:15:28] <brmbrmcar> maths22: I know, so the limit is useless.
[2015/11/15 16:15:45] <maths22> (I actually decided to not enable the console last time I wiped my config because I kept using fire() and ghost mode
[2015/11/15 16:15:49] <maths22> Ghost mode is so much fun ...
[2015/11/15 16:16:10] <brmbrmcar> But I don't want to remove it entirely, as doing so may cause bugs.
[2015/11/15 16:16:19] <brmbrmcar> How do you enable ghost mode?
[2015/11/15 16:16:39] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It should be set to INT_MAX
[2015/11/15 16:16:50] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/15 16:17:38] <maths22> I believe it is 'sector.Tux.ghost_mode(true)', but I may remember wrong
[2015/11/15 16:19:06] <brmbrmcar> The sector ghost_mode does not exist.

[2015/11/15 19:22:16] <maths22> I'm a little bit concerned with regards to the licensing on the new worldmap Restaurated island
[2015/11/15 19:22:27] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/15 19:22:58] <Tobbi> LMH: Try to print the value of that boolean flag m_langpack_mode or something to the console and then see what might be wrong.
[2015/11/15 19:23:13] <maths22> The fan site does not appear to have required uploaders to grant any rights to SuperTux/have given any license at all
[2015/11/15 19:23:57] <Tobbi> maths22: ...and it might be fairly difficult to get the original authors to grant the licenses in retrospective.
[2015/11/15 19:24:14] <Tobbi> maths22: Can't we make the whole worldmap "all rights reserved"?
[2015/11/15 19:24:27] <maths22> Tobbi: I don't disagree
[2015/11/15 19:24:43] <maths22> My concern is mostly with the "credit-taking" done in the intial level
[2015/11/15 19:24:57] <Tobbi> That will be fixed. LMH is working on it.
[2015/11/15 19:25:02] <maths22> Tobbi: great
[2015/11/15 19:25:04] <Tobbi> Or rather, has agreed to work on that.
[2015/11/15 19:25:09] <Tobbi> maths22: hume overshot a little.
[2015/11/15 19:25:42] <LMH> yeah, I didn't even think about the licensing
[2015/11/15 19:25:44] <maths22> Tobbi: we actually probably need to put something on that worldmap which explicitly "un-GPLs" it
[2015/11/15 19:25:56] <Tobbi> Yeah...
[2015/11/15 19:26:34] <Tobbi> maths22: On the other hand: If it's not under the GPL that means that hume had no rights to modify the contents of the levels in the first place.
[2015/11/15 19:26:43] <maths22> Tobbi: that is also probably true
[2015/11/15 19:27:04] <Tobbi> So, the legally right way would be to remove the worldmap altogether.
[2015/11/15 19:27:11] <maths22> Tobbi: that is actually correct
[2015/11/15 19:27:21] <maths22> We could distribute them unmodified, but then they would be unplayable
[2015/11/15 19:27:24] <LMH> anyone have access to the originals?  I'd like to know if any licensing was with the originals
[2015/11/15 19:27:43] <Tobbi> Many of them are on http://a062.apm.etc.tu-bs.de/pmlvls.php
[2015/11/15 19:27:58] <maths22> LMH: most of them don't seem to have licensing attached
[2015/11/15 19:27:59] <Tobbi> I even believe all of them.
[2015/11/15 19:28:21] <maths22> Tobbi: what do you mean?
[2015/11/15 19:28:32] <Tobbi> maths22: I believe all of them are from the fan site above.
[2015/11/15 19:28:46] <LMH> well, then the safe thing is to simply remove the addon
[2015/11/15 19:28:47] <maths22> Tobbi: given the intro, I think that is correct
[2015/11/15 19:28:55] <maths22> LMH: I sadly agree
[2015/11/15 19:29:00] <Tobbi> It's a shame, really...
[2015/11/15 19:29:16] <maths22> Especially given the work put into transforming them
[2015/11/15 19:29:18] <LMH> bah- wish I had thought of that first instead of cleaning up that intro
[2015/11/15 19:29:33] <maths22> LMH: actually, if possible, it should be removed from the git history and force pushed
[2015/11/15 19:30:23] <LMH> I can do that, might be messy for those who use the repo, but that should only be a few
[2015/11/15 19:31:06] <maths22> I agree, but that way we are defintely safe
[2015/11/15 19:31:08] <Not-6fa5> [02supertux] 03Success. The Travis CI build passed - 13https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux/builds/91295562
[2015/11/15 19:31:31] <maths22> LMH: By the way, I really like Fiona's world
[2015/11/15 19:31:43] <maths22> It's fun for if I want a worldmap that is easy to play through
[2015/11/15 19:31:55] <maths22> (Hume has some nice ones for the other end of the spectrum...)
[2015/11/15 19:32:07] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/15 19:34:39] <maths22> Also, if there is an updated fan site ever, any submissions should be required to be CC licensed
[2015/11/15 19:34:40] <LMH> maths22: thanks! that was the idea
[2015/11/15 19:34:49] <LMH> agreed
[2015/11/15 19:35:02] <maths22> (I think the CC license is more appropriate for levels than the GPL)
[2015/11/15 19:35:17] <LMH> of course the fan site was never an official piece of the project
[2015/11/15 19:35:17] <maths22> Since levels aren't source code, the GPL doesn't apply very well
[2015/11/15 19:35:28] <Tobbi> Couldn't we have our own site where people are allowed to upload their creations?
[2015/11/15 19:35:30] <maths22> LMH: I know
[2015/11/15 19:35:42] <maths22> Tobbi: yes
[2015/11/15 19:35:42] <LMH> Tobbi: that would be great
[2015/11/15 19:35:50] <Tobbi> I have been thinking about this, and it could integrate as well with the flexlay editor.
[2015/11/15 19:36:03] <Tobbi> Aka, allow people to upload levels directly from flexlay.
[2015/11/15 19:36:22] <maths22> Tobbi: if we have a clear vision, I am happy to work on the web-half implementation (and could probably provide the hosting)
[2015/11/15 19:36:24] <LMH> that would be cool
[2015/11/15 19:36:44] <Tobbi> maths22: Actually, file an issue against flexlay...
[2015/11/15 19:36:58] <Tobbi> maths22: How would the upload part look? POST?
[2015/11/15 19:37:12] <Tobbi> Sending a POST request from Python might be good.
[2015/11/15 19:37:18] <maths22> Tobbi: probably
[2015/11/15 19:37:18] <Tobbi> Or whatever there is.
[2015/11/15 19:37:37] <maths22> We would probably want to require authentication
[2015/11/15 19:37:43] <Tobbi> http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/ :P
[2015/11/15 19:37:47] <Tobbi> So, that's covered.
[2015/11/15 19:38:13] <maths22> Well, I'm off to dinner now
[2015/11/15 19:38:19] <Tobbi> sure.
[2015/11/15 19:38:20] <maths22> Good night to those of you in Europe
[2015/11/15 19:38:25] <Tobbi> good night.
[2015/11/15 19:38:30] <maths22> What time is it where you are?
[2015/11/15 19:39:18] <Tobbi> 1:37am
[2015/11/15 19:39:30] <maths22> 6:37 pm here
[2015/11/15 19:39:46] <LMH> 2:37 pm  here
[2015/11/15 19:40:40] <Tobbi> We're distributed all over the world, alright.
[2015/11/15 19:41:01] <maths22> I think it's kind of fun
[2015/11/15 19:41:10] <LMH> indeed
[2015/11/15 19:41:58] <Tobbi> So, I suggest a review queue where people from the team can review them before pushing them to the add-on repository...
[2015/11/15 19:42:00] <Tobbi> and stuff like that.
[2015/11/15 19:42:06] <Tobbi> But this is a huge undertaking anyway.
[2015/11/15 19:43:31] <maths22> A project for when I finish nightly builds
[2015/11/15 19:43:37] <maths22> :)
[2015/11/15 19:44:05] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/15 19:44:07] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/15 19:44:09] <Tobbi> Anyway, good night.
[2015/11/15 19:44:32] <LMH> we could tap into the community, let them rate levels and when they are seen as popular/stable enough we snag them for the repo
[2015/11/15 19:44:40] <LMH> oh, sorry good night
[2015/11/15 19:46:37] <Tobbi> LMH: That could work as well. But that's for post-0.4.0
[2015/11/15 19:47:06] <LMH> agreed
[2015/11/15 19:47:52] <Tobbi> LMH: So, can you file issues against the add-ons repository re. website etc.?
[2015/11/15 19:49:23] <LMH> Tobbi, I'm working on a full removal from the history, think we should tighten up access to that repo?
[2015/11/15 19:49:44] <Tobbi> LMH: We could. I believe HUme would complain, though.
[2015/11/15 19:49:53] <Tobbi> We just need to make sure that he sticks to the rules.
[2015/11/15 19:53:44] <LMH> he didn't follow the format either- we'll have to ask that he has anything reviewed first
[2015/11/15 19:54:18] <LMH> the addon repo is a little harder to deal with, requires some advanced knowledge
[2015/11/15 19:55:44] <Tobbi> I had trouble with it as well...
[2015/11/15 19:56:51] <LMH> I know, it is not trivial to work with- took me some time after it was remade to work properly
[2015/11/15 19:58:18] <Tobbi> LMH: But if we had a proper website with a backend, that would make things easier. We could create all the values automatically.
[2015/11/15 19:58:50] <LMH> that's true, would save me a lot of time when changing addons
[2015/11/15 20:09:09] @ Quit: Tobbi: 
[2015/11/15 20:30:42] <maths22> A proper website would be a very nice thing, and a nice future project
[2015/11/15 20:33:26] <maths22> Also, do we have a proper 0.4.0 todo list?
[2015/11/15 20:35:28] <LMH> maths22: I have not checked the todos for some time so honestly I'm not sure what state they are in.  I do agree that the website could use a bit of an overhaul.

[2015/11/15 21:42:38] <head8debian> maths22: Propper website? We just overhauled the current one (supertux.github.io) this spring.

[2015/11/15 21:46:14] <head8debian> frankly*

[2015/11/16 12:56:53] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Was there any discussion about Restaured Island I removal?
[2015/11/16 12:57:10] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Not that I'm aware of.
[2015/11/16 12:58:06] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Someone has to explain LMH what the Restaurator Island I is. He is often not there unfortunately.
[2015/11/16 12:58:39] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Yes.
[2015/11/16 12:58:47] <Hume2> We should reformulate the red part to make it clear to LMH.
[2015/11/16 12:59:13] <Hume2> Could you help me? Just write me a text file and I'll put it into the infoblocks.
[2015/11/16 12:59:27] <brmbrmcar> OK...
[2015/11/16 12:59:39] <brmbrmcar> So about the copyright stuff?
[2015/11/16 12:59:47] <Hume2> Yes, exactly.
[2015/11/16 13:00:23] <Hume2> I don't know the law terms in the other languages, so that's why I ask you to do it.

[2015/11/16 13:37:59] <brmbrmcar> Ok.
[2015/11/16 13:38:10] <brmbrmcar> I am restauring the next level.

[2015/11/16 13:44:19] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Thanks, but I still had some notes for levels 6 and 7.
[2015/11/16 13:44:51] <brmbrmcar> I thought I'd have to finish 7.
[2015/11/16 13:45:03] <brmbrmcar> The empty bonus blocks...
[2015/11/16 13:45:50] <Hume2> Well...
[2015/11/16 13:46:03] <brmbrmcar> I shall fix now.
[2015/11/16 13:46:36] <brmbrmcar> What shall I replace them with?
[2015/11/16 13:47:14] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It's hard to explain when you can't see me while working on it.
[2015/11/16 13:47:34] <brmbrmcar> Snow?
[2015/11/16 13:47:48] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes. You know me :D
[2015/11/16 13:48:23] <Hume2> I'll give you some examples of proper terrain: snow, darksow, forest ground, stone brick walls ...
[2015/11/16 13:49:16] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You can't get bellow those blocks, so the empty space bellow them is useless.
[2015/11/16 13:50:10] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Do you know Narreland? There's one strange thing that is in most of the Narreland levels. Do you know what is it?
[2015/11/16 13:50:38] <brmbrmcar> Is it the snow covering the feet?
[2015/11/16 13:51:05] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: That's hard to say.
[2015/11/16 13:51:39] <brmbrmcar> What is it then?
[2015/11/16 13:51:52] <Hume2> I make it usually not-covering the feet, because of the flames.
[2015/11/16 13:52:19] <Hume2> When you set the z-pos of interactive layer to 51, it covers the feet...
[2015/11/16 13:53:02] <Hume2> ...but it covers also all the flames, so they hide in the terrain and it's tricky to pass them.

[2015/11/16 13:58:18] <Hume2> It's contraproductive. So I'll remove the red part.

[2015/11/16 15:20:52] <maths22> You posted it above
[2015/11/16 15:23:14] <brmbrmcar> I made it myself.
[2015/11/16 15:23:38] <brmbrmcar> Noone owns any rights tyo it.
[2015/11/16 15:24:05] <maths22> brmbrmcar: My quesiton is because, at least under US copyright law, it is not really correct
[2015/11/16 15:24:33] <maths22> For something to qualify as "fair use" in the US, it must satisfy 4 conditions in some combination
[2015/11/16 15:24:47] <maths22> (US copyright law is confusing, but here is the basic idea)
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the purpose and character of your use
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the nature of the copyrighted work
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the effect of the use upon the potential market.
[2015/11/16 15:25:07] <brmbrmcar> Yeah, but think of it this way: if we were that strict on copyright, everything would be banned.
[2015/11/16 15:25:12] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Nope
[2015/11/16 15:25:19] <maths22> Most of our stuff has a CC license
[2015/11/16 15:25:22] <maths22> that lets us use it
[2015/11/16 15:25:49] <maths22> By default, we cannot use anything-permission must be explicitly granted (except for the specific carve-outs for "fair use")
[2015/11/16 15:25:54] <brmbrmcar> And also, how does this apply internationally?
[2015/11/16 15:26:15] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I can look into that, that said, I assume we want to be allowed to distribute the game in the US
[2015/11/16 15:26:38] <brmbrmcar> Exactly.
[2015/11/16 15:26:47] <brmbrmcar> It needs to be legal everywhere.
[2015/11/16 15:27:31] <maths22> CC licenses are "certified" as internationally valid
[2015/11/16 15:27:59] <brmbrmcar> THink of it this way: if Hukme
[2015/11/16 15:28:00] <maths22> (The GPL, while also internationally valid, does not apply to levels, which are really data not source code)
[2015/11/16 15:28:20] <brmbrmcar> randomally created those levels, would that be illegel?
[2015/11/16 15:28:34] <maths22> brmbrmcar: no, but that is irrelevant
[2015/11/16 15:28:50] <maths22> It is a known fact that they were created from the fan site levels
[2015/11/16 15:29:11] <maths22> His ability to create them independently does not make them any less tied to the originals
[2015/11/16 15:30:11] <brmbrmcar> But it is relevant, nbecause it is exactly the same.
[2015/11/16 15:30:29] <brmbrmcar> The proccess is not important.
[2015/11/16 15:30:35] <maths22> brmbrmcar: That is not true
[2015/11/16 15:30:50] <maths22> If I looked at the fan site levels, and Hume's levels, they would clearly be related
[2015/11/16 15:31:02] <maths22> Further, we have documentation, in several forms, that they are related
[2015/11/16 15:31:18] <maths22> Therefore, legally, Hume's levels are a derivative work of the original
[2015/11/16 15:32:20] <brmbrmcar> OK then. You win.
[2015/11/16 15:32:36] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I feel sorry for Hume, because I can tell he put a lot of work into the levels
[2015/11/16 15:32:43] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2015/11/16 15:33:12] <brmbrmcar> And I tried restoring some levels, and it isn't as easy as it sounds.
[2015/11/16 15:33:41] <maths22> LMH, Tobbi, and I discussed it last night, and collectively determined that, at least without consulting a lawyer, it would not be a good idea to keep the addon as part of the project
[2015/11/16 15:35:45] <brmbrmcar> :(

[2015/11/16 17:19:00] <maths22> Tobbi: the "metal" ones don't really look out of place in an icy world
[2015/11/16 17:19:09] <maths22> I can't say the same about the wooden ones
[2015/11/16 17:19:13] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/16 17:19:24] <Tobbi> I think the wooden ones look rather ugly...
[2015/11/16 17:19:41] <maths22> To me, the cannons work, but if someone wanted, they could add some icicles or something like that
[2015/11/16 17:19:48] <maths22> Tobbi: I must agree on the wooden ones
[2015/11/16 17:20:04] <maths22> It does not help that half of the levels that use them just have them floating in the air
[2015/11/16 17:20:09] <Tobbi> Sometimes we don't want to show any dispenser...
[2015/11/16 17:20:19] <maths22> In my opinion, they should be ceiling mounted, in a cloud, or invisible
[2015/11/16 17:20:25] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/16 17:20:34] <Tobbi> But in a cloud, we sometimes don't want the dispenser to be visible.
[2015/11/16 17:20:36] <maths22> Also, why does fireflower no longer destroy dispensers?
[2015/11/16 17:20:44] <Tobbi> Change made by hume someday.
[2015/11/16 17:20:47] <maths22> Tobbi: In theory, the cloud should cover up the dispenser
[2015/11/16 17:21:05] <Tobbi> maths22: It does, but I'd rather have a flag on the dispenser that sets it to hidden.
[2015/11/16 17:21:06] <maths22> Tobbi: Same with why it doesn't destroy crystallo?
[2015/11/16 17:21:15] <Tobbi> Because fire shouldn
[2015/11/16 17:21:19] <Tobbi> 't melt a crystal.
[2015/11/16 17:21:23] <maths22> Tobbi: this is true
[2015/11/16 17:21:26] <Tobbi> But that's also a change hume introduced.
[2015/11/16 17:21:51] <maths22> Then again, fire also shouldn't melt the spiky shells, but we kind of have to ignore that
[2015/11/16 17:22:17] <maths22> Also, in my opinion, the new forest jumpy graphics are not the most attractive
[2015/11/16 17:22:25] <Tobbi> True...
[2015/11/16 17:22:30] <Tobbi> Maybe we should reset them?
[2015/11/16 17:22:41] <maths22> Tobbi: the metal ones didn't look out of place
[2015/11/16 17:22:57] <Tobbi> maths22: Yes, I agree... can you undo the changes?
[2015/11/16 17:23:11] <maths22> Tobbi: not right now, but I will try to remember for later
[2015/11/16 17:23:17] <Tobbi> Or I could.
[2015/11/16 17:23:20] <Tobbi> I'll have to see..
[2015/11/16 17:27:12] <Tobbi> maths22: Do I keep the sprites themselves for reference or do I revert that commit as well?

[2015/11/17 10:40:00] <brmbrmcar> Any news on that retaured island 1?
[2015/11/17 10:40:33] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I changed everything needed, but didn't posted anything so far.
[2015/11/17 10:41:10] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: OK, then.
[2015/11/17 10:41:44] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I thought a new path mode, unordered.
[2015/11/17 10:41:51] <brmbrmcar> Apparently there was a discussion about it, but it was in the middle of the night.
[2015/11/17 10:41:57] <brmbrmcar> The path mode?
[2015/11/17 10:42:15] <Hume2> You know, we have circular, pingpong and oneshot.
[2015/11/17 10:42:27] <Hume2> Circular is default.
[2015/11/17 10:42:51] <brmbrmcar> Ah. Sothat.
[2015/11/17 10:43:09] <brmbrmcar> I always found it hard using paths.
[2015/11/17 10:43:29] <Hume2> Let'
[2015/11/17 10:43:54] <Hume2> Let's say that you have a platform and several places where it should go.
[2015/11/17 10:44:03] <brmbrmcar> Does it need testing before it can be merged?
[2015/11/17 10:44:16] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: No, but Tobbi could rage :D
[2015/11/17 10:44:49] <Hume2> I know that he doesn't rage, but he says "*sigh*".
[2015/11/17 10:45:02] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: ok, lets keep him calm.
[2015/11/17 10:46:56] <Hume2> I think that this mode could be useful for scripting.
[2015/11/17 10:49:10] <brmbrmcar> Yes, I agree.
[2015/11/17 10:50:04] <brmbrmcar> And also, it isn't as much hassle because the level editor is no longer maintained.

[2015/11/17 10:53:58] <Hume2> It's now kind of harder work... I have to add many classes...
[2015/11/17 10:54:18] <Hume2> That's why I have time for level design but not for editor.
[2015/11/17 10:54:58] <brmbrmcar> Level editors must be hard to make!
[2015/11/17 10:55:00] <Hume2> The worst is that it's not hard at all, but it's much writing.
[2015/11/17 10:55:33] <brmbrmcar> Yes. You have to get it to input everything.
[2015/11/17 10:55:46] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2015/11/17 10:56:05] <Hume2> Well, my plan:
[2015/11/17 10:56:48] <Hume2> After 0.4.0 will be released, I'll move the editor branch to origin, so everyone could contribute.
[2015/11/17 10:57:13] <brmbrmcar> Yay!
[2015/11/17 10:58:03] <brmbrmcar> Is there any talk of a release date for 0.4.0? Because some people will be dying to know....
[2015/11/17 10:58:36] <Hume2> I don't know anything else except that it'll be on X-mas 2015.
[2015/11/17 10:58:46] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/17 10:58:55] <brmbrmcar> When all the bugs are fixed.
[2015/11/17 10:59:28] <Hume2> That would take much longer time.
[2015/11/17 11:00:29] <brmbrmcar> Yes, completely.
[2015/11/17 11:01:16] <Hume2> Do you know, what I did with the switches recently?
[2015/11/17 11:01:26] <Hume2> It was today.
[2015/11/17 11:01:38] <brmbrmcar> Made them bi something
[2015/11/17 11:02:02] <brmbrmcar> bistable
[2015/11/17 11:02:35] <Hume2> Yes. Thay can be now used to turn something on and off.
[2015/11/17 11:02:52] <brmbrmcar> Nice!
[2015/11/17 11:03:07] <Hume2> This could be done before, but now the lever is down when it's turned on.
[2015/11/17 11:03:26] <brmbrmcar> THat is more clear.
[2015/11/17 11:03:35] <Hume2> It's in Magic Block Test.
[2015/11/17 11:04:31] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2015/11/17 11:04:40] <brmbrmcar> Will people useit?

[2015/11/17 11:11:37] <Hume2> sector.Tux.set_bonus(<bonus>) should work.
[2015/11/17 11:13:03] <brmbrmcar> The index no longer exists...

[2015/11/17 11:45:15] <Hume2> Karkus: Do you know what bistability is?
[2015/11/17 11:46:10] <Hume2> You can set an off-script and the switch is bistable then. When you don't set it, it acts as before.
[2015/11/17 11:46:27] <Hume2> And I opened a pull request.
[2015/11/17 11:50:02] <brmbrmcar> It can't be merged yet.
[2015/11/17 11:50:47] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Well, if someone tests it, I can.
[2015/11/17 11:51:14] <Karkus> Hume2: Okay, I get it
[2015/11/17 11:51:43] <Hume2> Karkus: Did you get what that means or you tested it?
[2015/11/17 11:51:55] <Karkus> Hume2: I understand the meaning
[2015/11/17 11:52:01] <Hume2> OK
[2015/11/17 11:52:01] <Karkus> Do you want me to test it?
[2015/11/17 11:52:15] <Hume2> That would be good.
[2015/11/17 11:52:38] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: You don't want to make Tobbi angery...
[2015/11/17 11:53:13] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: He decides faster when more people test it.

[2015/11/17 11:54:08] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: I k-now.
[2015/11/17 11:54:16] <Hume2> Karkus, yes, it is.
[2015/11/17 11:54:39] <Hume2> We are talking about merging, that can make Tobbi angry :D
[2015/11/17 11:54:54] <brmbrmcar> Why though?
[2015/11/17 11:55:19] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: He likes to be in control of the merging
[2015/11/17 11:55:32] <Hume2> ^ This
[2015/11/17 11:55:39] <brmbrmcar> He thinks he's in control of all Supertux.
[2015/11/17 11:55:56] <Karkus> Hume2: This does not appear to be related to Bistable switches
[2015/11/17 11:56:06] <Hume2> I know.
[2015/11/17 11:56:17] <Hume2> Bistable switches are in master.
[2015/11/17 11:56:23] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: And at the moment, he might as well be. He has worked to keep this project going
[2015/11/17 11:56:34] <Karkus> Hume2: You pushed straight to master???
[2015/11/17 11:56:50] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: Hume2:master
[2015/11/17 11:57:23] <Hume2> For bistable switches: They don't affect gameplay at all, because they are never used.
[2015/11/17 11:57:54] <brmbrmcar> Oh yeah.THose.
[2015/11/17 11:57:57] <Hume2> ...but test it please anyway. It's in Magic Block Test.
[2015/11/17 11:58:03] <brmbrmcar> This is confusing...
[2015/11/17 11:58:53] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: Any progress?
[2015/11/17 11:59:02] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: With...?
[2015/11/17 11:59:42] <Hume2> There are three switches in Magic Block Test. Just press them.
[2015/11/17 12:00:17] <Karkus> Hume2: Are you talking about hume2:master?
[2015/11/17 12:00:17] <Hume2> This may have higher priority than the unordered path.
[2015/11/17 12:00:28] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: building the ltest version/testing it.
[2015/11/17 12:00:41] <Hume2> Karkus: Bistable switches are in origin:master.
[2015/11/17 12:01:01] <Karkus> Hume2: Okay, I will test that after
[2015/11/17 12:01:13] <Karkus> Just need to build unordered path
[2015/11/17 12:01:33] <brmbrmcar> Karkus the builder!
[2015/11/17 12:01:51] <Hume2> Karkus: You can test the bistable switches in the same build.
[2015/11/17 12:02:37] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: So the scripts are independent?
[2015/11/17 12:02:39] <Karkus> Hume2: Are they in unordered_path branch?
[2015/11/17 12:04:31] <Hume2> Karkus: Unordered path is in hume2:unordered_path and bistable switches are in both.
[2015/11/17 12:04:40] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes.
[2015/11/17 12:05:28] <Karkus> Hume2: Is there a test level for bistable switches?

[2015/11/17 12:40:39] <brmbrmcar> invincible() is a script, not a function.

[2015/11/17 12:43:23] <brmbrmcar> An insane one is kill Tux when the level is finished.
[2015/11/17 12:46:10] <maths22> brmbrmcar: this is true.  However,  I think we should kill Tux when the level starts; then all levels are perfect since no one can play any of them :)

[2015/11/17 13:24:53] <Hume2> And I got that there are easter eggs in some forest levels.
[2015/11/17 13:26:26] <brmbrmcar> Ahoj, tady Hume2, co tomu ?k??
[2015/11/17 13:26:36] <Hume2> Yes.
[2015/11/17 13:27:04] <Hume2> In the WolfgangB's levels, there are texts made of invisible blocks saying "W.B.6/2006"
[2015/11/17 13:27:11] <brmbrmcar> What does it mean?
[2015/11/17 13:27:42] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It means: "Hello, here's Hume2, what do you say to this?"
[2015/11/17 13:28:38] <brmbrmcar> Nice.

[2015/11/17 17:53:37] <Karkus> Why?
[2015/11/17 17:54:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: Just saying. :P I am not expecting German comments at all :D
[2015/11/17 17:55:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: I misinterpreted the "from you"
[2015/11/17 17:55:08] <Tobbi> Ah, right.
[2015/11/17 17:55:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: Was sind drei Nazis in der Ecke?

[2015/11/17 17:55:38] <Karkus> Ich
[2015/11/17 17:55:51] <Tobbi> Karkus: Ein rechter Winkel.
[2015/11/17 17:56:57] <Tobbi> Okay, it only makes proper sense in German.
[2015/11/17 17:56:59] * Karkus thinks, and then looks up "Winkel"

[2015/11/17 17:57:24] <Karkus> Oh
[2015/11/17 17:57:25] <Karkus> I get it
[2015/11/17 17:57:46] <Karkus> Ecke is corner?

[2015/11/17 17:58:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: Correct.
[2015/11/17 17:58:37] <Karkus> I have a feeling I've heard a similar English joke
[2015/11/17 18:00:23] <Tobbi> Geht ein Vergewaltiger mit einem kleinen Jungen in den Wald. Sagt der Junge "Ganz schÃ¶n gruselig hier", sagt der Vergewaltiger "Was soll ich denn sagen, ich muss nachher alleine nach Hause".
[2015/11/17 18:03:51] <Karkus> Vergewaltiger?
[2015/11/17 18:04:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: rapist.
[2015/11/17 18:04:48] <Karkus> Tobbi: I wonder why I don't know that word?

[2015/11/17 18:14:35] <Tobbi> Yes, definitely.

[2015/11/17 18:16:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats that stand for? Emitting steam out of a smoke stack?
[2015/11/17 18:16:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: Should we notify the user of https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/228 util we fix it?
[2015/11/17 18:16:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: I did that already.... https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commit/adeb18125f971f681d5d8e9d0c6cab87d42db5e8
[2015/11/17 18:17:12] <Tobbi> "Please restart SuperTux for these changes to take effect." is proper English, isn't it?
[2015/11/17 18:17:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: Perfect English
[2015/11/17 18:17:50] <Tobbi> Good
[2015/11/17 18:18:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: When does this appear?
[2015/11/17 18:18:11] <Karkus> When you change language?
[2015/11/17 18:18:12] <Tobbi> Karkus: upon enabling / disabling a language pack.
[2015/11/17 18:18:24] <Tobbi> Actually...I wonder what happens if you install language packs for the first time.
[2015/11/17 18:18:53] <Karkus> What is a language pack? Is this a new thing?
[2015/11/17 18:19:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: An add-on that contains new strings.
[2015/11/17 18:19:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Seperate to the actual addons?
[2015/11/17 18:19:28] <Tobbi> Aka, new .po files.

[2015/11/17 18:20:13] <Tobbi> Take a look at https://github.com/SuperTux/addons/tree/master/src/langpack-de
[2015/11/17 18:21:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah, I see. Is this one installed automatically then? (Seeing halloween 2014 there)
[2015/11/17 18:21:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, you need to check for them.
[2015/11/17 18:21:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/17 18:21:58] <Tobbi> Installing automatically can get difficult.

[2015/11/17 18:26:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: Here's a question: Why are the language names on the language list all in English?
[2015/11/17 18:26:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, that can be changed easily.
[2015/11/17 18:26:40] <Tobbi> It was / is merely a test.
[2015/11/17 18:27:05] <Karkus> I think we should put a small globe button on the main menu to change language, rather than navigating through in a foreign one
[2015/11/17 18:27:18] <Tobbi> Sure, go ahead.
[2015/11/17 18:27:33] <Karkus> Okay
[2015/11/17 18:28:30] <leper`> but that takes all the fun away, you'll never have to remember which item in the menu was the correct one when you set the game to a language where you can't even read the letters

[2015/11/18 10:52:01] <brmbrmcar> Hi!
[2015/11/18 10:55:37] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Any idea what LMH means by "check with others first"?
[2015/11/18 10:55:51] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/18 10:55:57] <Hume2> ...for Restaured Island I.
[2015/11/18 10:56:55] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Nooo.#
[2015/11/18 10:57:33] <brmbrmcar> He already discussed it himself.
[2015/11/18 10:58:03] <Hume2> Let's do it this way. Do you know anyone who hasn't tested it so far?
[2015/11/18 10:58:16] <Hume2> Well, I tested it.
[2015/11/18 10:58:31] <Hume2> It looks like Tobbi has tested it as well.
[2015/11/18 10:58:42] <brmbrmcar> I tested it, of course.
[2015/11/18 10:59:31] <Hume2> That's what I expected. It looks like Max Teufel has tested it too.
[2015/11/18 10:59:51] <Hume2> ...beacuse he had some notes to it.
[2015/11/18 11:00:39] <brmbrmcar> I just cheated the whole thing, so I could test every level without spending time getting past tricky parts.
[2015/11/18 11:01:09] <brmbrmcar> And I stand with what I have said; the levels are heavily modified.
[2015/11/18 11:01:11] <Hume2> That's what I did with Dark world.
[2015/11/18 11:01:43] <Hume2> So the licencing is OK.
[2015/11/18 11:02:06] <Hume2> You will be in special thanks after it will be added again.
[2015/11/18 11:02:28] <brmbrmcar> It will be added. I am determind.

[2015/11/18 11:03:49] <Hume2> I think that Karkus looks like he wouldn't pass it untested. I'll ask him.
[2015/11/18 11:04:29] <Hume2> leyyin_: Did you tested Restaured Island I until LMH deleted it?
[2015/11/18 11:04:35] <brmbrmcar> Karkus will probably be here soon.
[2015/11/18 11:04:51] <leyyin_> Hume2, no, sorry
[2015/11/18 11:05:27] <brmbrmcar> Aw.

[2015/11/18 11:07:11] <Hume2> It's the old version. The new vesion differs only by the intro and extro.
[2015/11/18 11:09:09] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/18 11:09:18] <brmbrmcar> Where new one?
[2015/11/18 11:09:30] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I'll add it now.

[2015/11/18 11:29:22] <maths22> We have no right to do anything with the fan site levels
[2015/11/18 11:29:44] <maths22> They did not grant us a license, and heavy modification simply makes them a derivative work

[2015/11/18 11:30:30] <maths22> We may not like that, and I really appreciate the effort that was put into the worldmap, but that doesn't make it legal

[2015/11/18 11:32:13] <maths22> What did not make sense about that argument?
[2015/11/18 11:32:13] <brmbrmcar> But we still disagree.
[2015/11/18 11:32:22] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Was any license specifies
[2015/11/18 11:32:23] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I thought we had ended in agreement.
[2015/11/18 11:32:28] <Karkus> specified?
[2015/11/18 11:32:36] <brmbrmcar> maths22: Yes, that one.
[2015/11/18 11:32:50] <maths22> brmbrmcar: then how do we disagree
[2015/11/18 11:32:53] <maths22> ?
[2015/11/18 11:33:25] <brmbrmcar> Arguing and disagreeing are different.
[2015/11/18 11:33:41] <maths22> By argument, I meant claim
[2015/11/18 11:33:45] <maths22> not debate
[2015/11/18 11:34:17] <brmbrmcar> You are very confusing.
[2015/11/18 11:34:20] <maths22> Karkus: the fan site has no grant of license, and the levels I checked do not have licenses attached
[2015/11/18 11:34:41] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I'm sorry.  I was trying to be clear, but evidently I failed
[2015/11/18 11:34:45] <Karkus> maths22: Can I have a link to the fan site?
[2015/11/18 11:34:58] <Karkus> maths22: Made sense to me...
[2015/11/18 11:35:04] <maths22> Karkus: http://a062.apm.etc.tu-bs.de/pmlvls.php?frn=0&snr=30&ord=odif
[2015/11/18 11:35:44] <Hume2> mats22: What country are you from?
[2015/11/18 11:35:59] <maths22> Hume2: United States
[2015/11/18 11:36:19] <maths22> That said, this aspect of copyright is fairly similar in the EU to the best of my knowledge
[2015/11/18 11:36:37] <Hume2> It is similar but not the same.
[2015/11/18 11:37:00] <maths22> Hume2: I know.  Hence why I defered to LMH and Tobbi for a european perspective
[2015/11/18 11:37:30] <brmbrmcar> And you can't copyright everything.
[2015/11/18 11:37:42] <mt> (in Germany) If there's no license specified it is to assume that the original creator has all the rights until 70 years after their death
[2015/11/18 11:38:04] <brmbrmcar> If copyright was this bad, nothing would belegal.
[2015/11/18 11:38:10] <maths22> brmbrmcar: that is not true
[2015/11/18 11:38:39] <maths22> You can use things without violating copyright
[2015/11/18 11:38:49] <maths22> You can even often modify them for personal use
[2015/11/18 11:39:15] <maths22> But you can't modify and distribute them without some kind of permission from the original copyright holder
[2015/11/18 11:39:28] <maths22> Hence why in the open source world, we use licenses
[2015/11/18 11:39:29] <head8debian> maths22: Exactly.
[2015/11/18 11:39:40] <Hume2> maths22: Read the new intro.
[2015/11/18 11:39:45] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but if things were like this and you copyrighted maths22, you would never be allowed to say the word maths.
[2015/11/18 11:40:01] <head8debian> oh brother...
[2015/11/18 11:40:21] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I cannot copyright maths22 even if I wanted to
[2015/11/18 11:40:26] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Trade names are trade marks.
[2015/11/18 11:40:43] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Copyright protects intellectual property
[2015/11/18 11:40:46] <maths22> I might be able to trademark it, so someone else couldn't claim to be me and do buisness as me
[2015/11/18 11:40:54] <brmbrmcar> It is purely an  example.
[2015/11/18 11:41:15] <maths22> The principle is that copyright protects the specific execution of an idea, and not the idea itself
[2015/11/18 11:41:28] <Hume2> Please stop this empty discussion and read the new intro. https://github.com/Hume2/addons/blob/6461cbcd31e7dafd6e255540bbb2dbbf9a2fc91b/src/restaurator1/levels/restaurator1/intro.txt
[2015/11/18 11:41:50] <maths22> Hume2: that is an unfounded claim
[2015/11/18 11:41:57] <maths22> It is clearly a derivative work
[2015/11/18 11:41:58] <mt> derivations of works are *not* legal
[2015/11/18 11:42:11] <mt> (without the permission of the copyright holder)
[2015/11/18 11:42:13] <maths22> You even say that yourself by saying that there *is* an original author
[2015/11/18 11:42:29] <maths22> As a derivative work, it does not somehow lose the original copyright
[2015/11/18 11:42:45] <maths22> It actually can only exist if the original copyright holder has granted permission for it
[2015/11/18 11:43:18] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/18 11:43:29] <brmbrmcar> Well, it is in plan English.
[2015/11/18 11:44:12] <maths22> head8debian: you can see why I am tired of this conversation///
[2015/11/18 11:44:21] <maths22> (That was supposed to be an elipsis)
[2015/11/18 11:45:10] <Hume2> Taking the idea of the level is legal. Have you ever compared those levels with the my ones?
[2015/11/18 11:45:18] <brmbrmcar> Well, no one complained before the subject was brought up.
[2015/11/18 11:46:12] <brmbrmcar> ume2: Exactly.
[2015/11/18 11:46:39] <Hume2> Well, let's make some rules for complaining.
[2015/11/18 11:46:53] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/18 11:46:54] <mt> If you say you took the idea of a level you're saying you took intellectual property from the original author.

[2015/11/18 11:47:42] <Hume2> Inspiration is legal, because noone can ever get where I was really inspired.
[2015/11/18 11:48:14] <Hume2> If taking the idea was illegal, then there would be no legal art work since 1900.
[2015/11/18 11:48:22] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/18 11:48:29] <maths22> Tobbi: Welcome!
[2015/11/18 11:48:29] <Tobbi> It's more than an inspiration...
[2015/11/18 11:48:34] <Tobbi> Yes, thank you.
[2015/11/18 11:48:50] <maths22> Tobbi: This is true.  We are literally citing the original author and using the original title
[2015/11/18 11:49:05] <brmbrmcar> Hume2 is right.
[2015/11/18 11:49:32] <Hume2> 80% of tiles are changed.
[2015/11/18 11:49:45] <Tobbi> The overall look isn't.
[2015/11/18 11:50:07] <Hume2> Have you compared it?
[2015/11/18 11:50:17] <maths22> Hume2: A numeric percent of tiles changed doesn't tell me anything
[2015/11/18 11:50:34] <maths22> I could get 100% tiles changed converting a level from the forest world to the ice world
[2015/11/18 11:50:45] <maths22> That wouldn't make it any less of a derivative work
[2015/11/18 11:50:56] <brmbrmcar> maths22:Yes, it does.
[2015/11/18 11:51:04] <Tobbi> ffs, no it doesn't.
[2015/11/18 11:51:11] <Tobbi> The arrangement of the tiles is significant.
[2015/11/18 11:51:15] <Tobbi> Aka, the overall look
[2015/11/18 11:51:38] <Tobbi> We have been over this...
[2015/11/18 11:51:56] <maths22> Tobbi: this is our 3rd time
[2015/11/18 11:51:56] <mt> brmbrmcar: Go ask your lawyer if you don't believe us. If you can't afford one, there's probably some subreddit where you can ask as well
[2015/11/18 11:52:01] <Hume2> Well, LMH stole me the rotating coins :D
[2015/11/18 11:52:07] <maths22> brmbrmcar's 2nd
[2015/11/18 11:52:18] <Tobbi> So.
[2015/11/18 11:52:35] <Tobbi> Guys if you want, ask for permission with every original author...
[2015/11/18 11:52:40] <brmbrmcar> Why did you lot even start this argument?
[2015/11/18 11:52:44] <Tobbi> Though some of them will likely not be available any longer.
[2015/11/18 11:53:11] <maths22> brmbrmcar: because when I first played the worldmap, I thought to check on the licencing
[2015/11/18 11:53:19] <maths22> And noticed that it did not work
[2015/11/18 11:53:35] <maths22> Since it is a bad idea to violate copyright, I asked other peoples' opinions
[2015/11/18 11:53:54] <brmbrmcar> I can't be bothered with licenses.I would let someone modify my work.
[2015/11/18 11:54:07] <Tobbi> So that would make it PD...
[2015/11/18 11:54:19] <Tobbi> And that needs to be specified.
[2015/11/18 11:54:36] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Although it is nice to know that you would not pursue someone for copyright violation, that would not make other people any less in violation
[2015/11/18 11:54:45] <maths22> Hence why we use licences
[2015/11/18 11:55:04] <maths22> If I saw your work, and there wasn't a licence, I wouldn't take the risk of using it
[2015/11/18 11:55:05] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I would guess your original age is around 13-16 from what you wrote...
[2015/11/18 11:55:16] <Tobbi> no license = all rights reserved.
[2015/11/18 11:55:27] <maths22> How do I know that you won't come after me for copyright infringement sometime later
[2015/11/18 11:55:46] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/18 11:55:52] <brmbrmcar> So if I even think of something,you say that is copyright?
[2015/11/18 11:55:59] <Karkus> What Tobbi just said is just how it works, brmbrmcar. Don't argue with us about it
[2015/11/18 11:56:23] <maths22> brmbrmcar: No, but if you write it down, that writing is copyrighted
[2015/11/18 11:56:25] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: You need proof too
[2015/11/18 11:56:26] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Thinking of something doesn't make it art. Putting it into action does make it art.
[2015/11/18 11:56:29] <brmbrmcar> Well, then don't make a silly argument.
[2015/11/18 11:56:48] <brmbrmcar> Personal use.
[2015/11/18 11:56:51] <Karkus> *sigh*
[2015/11/18 11:57:07] <brmbrmcar> You say personal use is copyright now?
[2015/11/18 11:57:37] <Karkus> No. You can do that
[2015/11/18 11:57:54] <mt> What we do is a) not personal use and b) even copyright can apply for personal use under some jurisdictions
[2015/11/18 11:57:55] <Karkus> You cannot distribute it though, I think
[2015/11/18 11:58:04] <maths22> Karkus: this would be correct
[2015/11/18 11:58:13] <maths22> For the most part, copyright actually applies to personal use
[2015/11/18 11:58:49] <maths22> Its just that there is no way for anyone to find out
[2015/11/18 11:58:54] <brmbrmcar> And, anyway, why is the addons repository so strict?
[2015/11/18 11:59:15] <Tobbi> Okay this is enough for now.
[2015/11/18 11:59:19] <brmbrmcar> Why does it need thorough checking before adding?
[2015/11/18 11:59:23] <Karkus> This is the world, not the addons repo.
[2015/11/18 11:59:29] <maths22> Tobbi: I agree
[2015/11/18 11:59:29] <brmbrmcar> OK, this is enough.
[2015/11/18 11:59:33] <Tobbi> Good.
[2015/11/18 11:59:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/18 11:59:39] <brmbrmcar> End!
[2015/11/18 11:59:43] <brmbrmcar> For now...

[2015/11/18 13:31:07] <mt> ship a minimal WM without a lot of configuration, call /usr/bin/supertux2 in xinitrc
[2015/11/18 13:31:26] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/18 13:32:13] <brmbrmcar> Supertux OS 0.4.0
[2015/11/18 13:42:53] <head8debian> Great, i "bricked" my GPS... :p
[2015/11/18 13:48:59] <brmbrmcar> Bad!
[2015/11/18 13:54:38] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes, you can delete that level.
[2015/11/18 13:56:06] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: OK...
[2015/11/18 13:57:22] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Could we have a private talk?
[2015/11/18 13:57:27] <brmbrmcar> Aw flip...
[2015/11/18 13:57:49] <Not-6fa5> [02supertux] 07Karkus476 commented on issue 03#229: Stop doors fom blacking out the screen when they aren't being used - 13http://git.io/v4icO
[2015/11/18 13:57:52] <Tobbi> That either means something good or something very bad..
[2015/11/18 13:58:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: Doors black out the screen in case you enter them... However, you can simply not go through them, yet the screen will be blacked out for some time.
[2015/11/18 13:58:47] <Tobbi> And i believe this is what he is complaining about in that issue.
[2015/11/18 13:59:24] <Tobbi> I don't know a solution to that anyway.
[2015/11/18 13:59:46] <Tobbi> However, we could have that blackout effect just before the sector switch.
[2015/11/18 13:59:50] <Tobbi> But that adds a few seconds...
[2015/11/18 13:59:59] <Tobbi> Aka, people might be complaining about them not getting best stats.

[2015/11/18 14:02:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, you go up to a door, press up, then walk off?
[2015/11/18 14:02:53] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, basically, the screen fadeout starts once the door opens...we could make it so it starts later.
[2015/11/18 14:02:56] <Tobbi> And is shorter.
[2015/11/18 14:03:14] <brmbrmcar> That is good.
[2015/11/18 14:04:04] <Tobbi> but a lot of work, I believe.
[2015/11/18 14:04:04] <Karkus> You shouldn't be able to walk around once you've pressed up. You should freeze in place and a door entering animation should show
[2015/11/18 14:04:18] <Tobbi> Well, currently it just fades.
[2015/11/18 14:04:46] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but that is even worse.

[2015/11/19 09:03:50] <Tobbi> It works fine.
[2015/11/19 09:16:23] <Tobbi> But since it's a release candidate, I am not sure if we should use it in the final release.
[2015/11/19 09:16:26] <Tobbi> I'd rather not.

[2015/11/19 10:14:33] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/19 10:14:47] <maths22> The issue is that I have to merge the main repo into my fork
[2015/11/19 10:17:51] <grumbel> What are the near term plans for SuperTux? Is there a new release soon?
[2015/11/19 10:24:45] <Tobbi> grumbel: We plan on releasing milestone 2 next month. Probably on the 20th.
[2015/11/19 10:25:06] <Tobbi> MS 2 works stable enough so that a final release should be justified.
[2015/11/19 10:25:45] <grumbel> ok, then I'll wait with my lisp->sexp replacement till after that, as that might break a bit of stuff
[2015/11/19 10:25:58] <Tobbi> Okay, unless you can unbreak this easily. :P
[2015/11/19 10:26:20] <Tobbi> maths22: I suppose we should use Squirrel 3.0 stable instead of 3.1 release candidate? Or what do you think?
[2015/11/19 10:26:38] <Tobbi> I mean: Both is in the repository...
[2015/11/19 10:30:26] <maths22> Tobbi: I would say to stick with the stable release
[2015/11/19 10:30:31] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2015/11/19 10:30:54] <maths22> grumbel: What is this 'lisp->sexp replacement'?
[2015/11/19 10:31:15] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/19 10:31:55] <Tobbi> Maybe squirrel guys will release 3.1 as stable...
[2015/11/19 10:31:56] <grumbel> maths22: cleanup up file reading a little and replacing the lisp/ code with https://travis-ci.org/lispparser/sexp-cpp (which is a cleaned up version of code in lisp/)
[2015/11/19 10:32:35] <grumbel> better link: https://github.com/lispparser/sexp-cpp
[2015/11/19 10:33:13] <Tobbi> Did I do pull requests against those repos or did you just pull in my commits from supertux?
[2015/11/19 10:34:17] <Tobbi> never mind.

[2015/11/19 10:38:49] <Tobbi> If not, doesn't matter, we display a message to the user...
[2015/11/19 10:39:27] <maths22> grumbel: Thanks
[2015/11/19 10:40:19] <Tobbi> I could probably add a submodule in another branch for that lisp parser, couldn't I?
[2015/11/19 10:40:50] <Tobbi> Oh, wait, it might not be ready yet.
[2015/11/19 10:41:39] <grumbel> that can wait
[2015/11/19 10:41:44] <Tobbi> okay...
[2015/11/19 10:42:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: What are you guys doing?
[2015/11/19 10:42:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: Uhm, grumbel has reworked the lisp parser quite a bit...but we likely won't make it until the release of 0.4.0...with testing and stuff...
[2015/11/19 10:43:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: By the way: Feature freeze already passed, right?
[2015/11/19 10:43:18] <Tobbi> When is string freeze?
[2015/11/19 10:44:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: String freeze?
[2015/11/19 10:44:25] <Tobbi> head8debian: You know, when you snatch a girl's underpants and put it in the fridge.
[2015/11/19 10:44:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: We are only a month from release... so we should not be incorperating really anything...
[2015/11/19 10:44:38] <head8debian> except bug fixes.
[2015/11/19 10:44:38] <Tobbi> Or rather freezer
[2015/11/19 10:44:44] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/19 10:44:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: String freeze is when the strings = all text is frozen.
[2015/11/19 10:45:05] <Tobbi> So that translators don't have to incorporate changes...
[2015/11/19 10:45:19] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/11/19 10:45:20] <Tobbi> But since we don't know where giby is...we shouldn't really be doing anything.
[2015/11/19 10:45:43] <Tobbi> head8debian: does makepot.sh work for you?
[2015/11/19 10:45:52] <Tobbi> From a non-Mac / non-Windows computer..
[2015/11/19 10:49:50] <maths22> Tobbi: I think my build changes should probably get integrated before release

[2015/11/19 10:50:03] <Tobbi> maths22: sure, thanks.
[2015/11/19 10:50:49] <Tobbi> head8debian: couldn't you postpone the logo issue? I am not sure whether we should change our logo at all, but who knows...
[2015/11/19 10:51:01] <Tobbi> maths22: Please do a pull request when you're ready.
[2015/11/19 10:51:07] <Tobbi> maths22: Also, what about the changes to the squirrel lib?
[2015/11/19 10:51:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: Anyone can re-open it if they want...
[2015/11/19 10:51:14] <Tobbi> Right!
[2015/11/19 10:51:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't like having stuff floating in my hair.
[2015/11/19 10:51:24] <maths22> Tobbi: What am I doing with squirrel?
[2015/11/19 10:51:25] <head8debian> ;)
[2015/11/19 10:51:41] <Tobbi> maths22: https://github.com/SuperTux/squirrel/pull/1 ?
[2015/11/19 10:51:46] <head8debian> Tobbi: makepot.sh?
[2015/11/19 10:52:06] <Tobbi> maths22: Also https://github.com/SuperTux/tinygettext/pull/1
[2015/11/19 10:52:17] <Tobbi> To be honest, I don't know anything about this...
[2015/11/19 10:52:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: makepot.sh should create localizations...
[2015/11/19 10:52:36] <maths22> Tobbi: I see what you are talking about
[2015/11/19 10:52:44] <maths22> I'm going to close those and open a new set
[2015/11/19 10:52:52] <Tobbi> okay, sounds good.
[2015/11/19 10:53:00] <maths22> It's just little changes mostly to make Windows happy
[2015/11/19 10:53:03] <Tobbi> As I said, I am not too familiar with CMake...
[2015/11/19 10:53:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, it doesn't have any rm -rf commands... and it finished properly... :-)
[2015/11/19 10:53:41] <head8debian> Not sure what it did...
[2015/11/19 10:53:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, so, because it didn't work on my mac.
[2015/11/19 10:53:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: Does git diff show you anything?

[2015/11/19 10:55:33] <Tobbi> Okay....
[2015/11/19 10:55:49] <Tobbi> not what I expected, anyway.
[2015/11/19 10:56:12] <head8debian> Does anything ever come out the way we expect? :p
[2015/11/19 10:56:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: Not with this project, no.
[2015/11/19 10:57:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't think its just us...
[2015/11/19 10:58:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Now, if you copy one of the add-on levelsets (the actual directory, not the zip) to data/levels, then run that command again?
[2015/11/19 11:04:02] <Tobbi> Aha!
[2015/11/19 11:04:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: I fixed it!
[2015/11/19 11:04:45] <Tobbi> It uses strange line endings that were converted.
[2015/11/19 11:09:48] <Tobbi> Oh, it created a pot file.
[2015/11/19 11:09:53] <Tobbi> Not sure what that does.
[2015/11/19 11:09:53] <maths22> Tobbi: Windows and OS X are up to date here: http://brlcad.org/~maths22/supertux-download.php
[2015/11/19 11:10:08] <maths22> Linux is building and will be up to date at some point
[2015/11/19 11:10:22] <Tobbi> maths22: Except that "The requested URL /usr/web/brlcad.org/builds/SUPERTUX-0.4.0-GIT-Darwin.dmg was not found on this server." ;)
[2015/11/19 11:10:52] <maths22> Tobbi: fixing...
[2015/11/19 11:10:57] <Tobbi> :-)
[2015/11/19 11:12:15] <Tobbi> I should actually change the URL in the topic.
[2015/11/19 11:12:29] @ Tobbi set topic "Welcome to the SuperTux chat | https://github.com/SuperTux | Stable: 0.1.3 | Beta: 0.3.5a | Travis: https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux | mailing list: supertux-devel@lists.lethargik.org | Â©hÃ¤Ã±Ã±Ã¨Å ÅÃ´Ç¥ http://sydneyjd.github.io/logs/ | nightly builds http://brlcad.org/~maths22/supertux-download.php"

[2015/11/19 11:13:59] <Tobbi> Thanks, looks good.
[2015/11/19 11:14:26] <Tobbi> maths22: Would it be possible for you to display the commit hash of the file and the build date on that site?
[2015/11/19 11:14:40] <Tobbi> eeh, by commit hash I mean the HEAD commit SHA...
[2015/11/19 11:15:23] <maths22> Tobbi: That will be added
[2015/11/19 11:15:34] <Tobbi> Great.
[2015/11/19 11:15:48] <maths22> Tobbi: Is it OK if I change cmake version numbers to use git describe?
[2015/11/19 11:15:49] <Tobbi> maths22: By the way: Shall I add you to the credits before the release?
[2015/11/19 11:15:54] <Tobbi> maths22: Yes, sure.
[2015/11/19 11:16:10] <maths22> Tobbi: Sure on the credits
[2015/11/19 11:16:20] <maths22> Do you have my real name?
[2015/11/19 11:16:36] <Tobbi> maths22: I don't. Actually you can submit a PR for credits.txt and I will merge that :)

[2015/11/19 11:33:19] <brmbrmcar> Why is it 'nightly'?
[2015/11/19 11:33:52] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: It builds supertux every night or pretty close to that.
[2015/11/19 11:34:18] <brmbrmcar> So, what about my error when trying to install a nightly build?
[2015/11/19 11:36:42] <Tobbi> maths22: There's something weird going on: The nightly build for Mac crashes (for some reason). Also the executable is only 276 bytes in size.
[2015/11/19 11:36:51] <Tobbi> So, there might have been a problem with loading the file
[2015/11/19 11:37:24] <brmbrmcar> All the nightly builds are throwing up errors.
[2015/11/19 11:38:05] <Tobbi> Maybe not all of them.
[2015/11/19 11:38:23] <brmbrmcar> Well, everything I've tried.
[2015/11/19 11:38:40] <brmbrmcar> Wine, maybe? I'll test it.
[2015/11/19 11:39:44] <head8debian> I will give the windows one a try later.
[2015/11/19 11:41:25] <brmbrmcar> In the Windows build, not executable file is generated.
[2015/11/19 11:41:41] <brmbrmcar> Youjust get the uninstall.exe
[2015/11/19 11:42:18] <brmbrmcar> The package is so crazy!
[2015/11/19 11:42:57] <maths22> Clearly something failed.
[2015/11/19 11:42:59] <maths22> I will fix that
[2015/11/19 11:43:37] <Tobbi> But this release will be great.
[2015/11/19 11:43:39] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/11/19 11:43:46] <head8debian> Yes it will. :-)
[2015/11/19 11:43:47] <brmbrmcar> December 20?
[2015/11/19 11:44:02] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: We have no dates set currently...
[2015/11/19 11:44:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: What day does the christmas code kick in again?
[2015/11/19 11:44:33] <brmbrmcar> 6th
[2015/11/19 11:44:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: Gosh, I don't know. Calculate it. :D
[2015/11/19 11:45:08] <Tobbi> Yes, the 6th
[2015/11/19 11:45:16] <brmbrmcar> Yay!
[2015/11/19 11:45:21] <Tobbi> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/68bdf113c9cf702f206d3ce078a4c09340bb8ce1/src/supertux/gameconfig.hpp
[2015/11/19 11:46:39] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Were you able to get a screenshot for https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/227 ?
[2015/11/19 11:47:05] <brmbrmcar> Hang on...
[2015/11/19 11:48:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: Could we release on maybe the 10th?
[2015/11/19 11:48:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: I guess whenever we feel like it. :-)
[2015/11/19 11:48:45] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: It is very hard to capture, as it is only there for a very small amount of time.
[2015/11/19 11:50:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, this should be set in advance.
[2015/11/19 11:51:03] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So you're saying that the game freezes loading the game assets etc.?
[2015/11/19 11:51:07] <Tobbi> But works afterwards?
[2015/11/19 11:51:29] <brmbrmcar> Ah, for that.
[2015/11/19 11:52:13] <brmbrmcar> It shows afterwards, but the screen updates around every 5 seconds
[2015/11/19 11:52:21] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/19 11:52:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: Good idea... Sometime in december...
[2015/11/19 11:52:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: That was irony, wasn't it?
[2015/11/19 11:53:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: I believe the 10th is a bit too early...didn't we set for the 20th?
[2015/11/19 11:53:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: I belive we did.
[2015/11/19 11:53:30] <Tobbi> That's a sunday, so should work fine.
[2015/11/19 11:53:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its a decent time. ;) Right before Christmas. :-)
[2015/11/19 11:53:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: Definitely.
[2015/11/19 11:53:55] <brmbrmcar> Why does the day of the week matter?
[2015/11/19 11:54:06] <Tobbi> Also 0.3.0 or something was released on the 20th as well.
[2015/11/19 11:54:12] <head8debian> Deck the website with boughs of holly, lalalalala lalalala. :p
[2015/11/19 11:54:14] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Because release dates tend to be tressful.
[2015/11/19 11:54:24] <head8debian> haha.
[2015/11/19 11:54:26] <head8debian> True.
[2015/11/19 11:54:27] <Tobbi> *stressful
[2015/11/19 11:54:44] <brmbrmcar> You like Sunday stress!
[2015/11/19 11:54:52] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I have college during the weekdays...
[2015/11/19 11:55:18] <head8debian> I have school.
[2015/11/19 11:55:40] <Tobbi> We should *actually* see if we can fetch available langpacks for people on startup.
[2015/11/19 11:55:54] <Tobbi> and / or when switching languages.
[2015/11/19 11:56:05] <Tobbi> That should be done before the release.
[2015/11/19 11:56:08] <Tobbi> LMH told me about it.
[2015/11/19 11:57:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok. Well, just so long as everything is "still" stable.
[2015/11/19 11:58:03] <head8debian> Im shocked that we are so close to release...
[2015/11/19 11:58:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: Maybe I won't do it.
[2015/11/19 11:58:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: Sure, but the release date was planned way in advance, right?
[2015/11/19 11:58:28] <Tobbi> didn't we?
[2015/11/19 11:58:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes.
[2015/11/19 11:59:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its just coming up so fast.
[2015/11/19 11:59:18] <Tobbi> Right...
[2015/11/19 11:59:33] <Tobbi> head8debian: But this release is great... Lots of stuff added and finished etc.
[2015/11/19 12:00:20] <brmbrmcar> Nice and stable. No Windows or OSX computers will blow up because of us.
[2015/11/19 12:00:29] <Tobbi> Yes, and that.
[2015/11/19 12:00:33] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/11/19 12:03:07] <brmbrmcar> Supertux will be released in 31 days.
[2015/11/19 12:03:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: http://lwn.net/Articles/250967/ :D
[2015/11/19 12:03:22] <head8debian> Perfect article for you. :D
[2015/11/19 12:03:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: Not right now.
[2015/11/19 12:03:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am a little concerned whether giby will show up...Because he hasn't...
[2015/11/19 12:04:05] <Tobbi> We need up-to-date localizations.
[2015/11/19 12:04:23] <brmbrmcar> head8debian:Why is Tux wearing glasses?
[2015/11/19 12:04:41] <brmbrmcar> They are blue!
[2015/11/19 12:05:32] <head8debian> ~seen giby
[2015/11/19 12:05:32] <red_bot> head8debian: giby was last seen 12 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 33 seconds ago, quitting IRC (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[2015/11/19 12:05:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: :-/
[2015/11/19 12:05:51] <Tobbi> Yes, precisely...
[2015/11/19 12:06:55] <brmbrmcar> \-:
[2015/11/19 12:07:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, he has one month to appear... If not... :-/
[2015/11/19 12:07:14] <brmbrmcar> And what are the odds?
[2015/11/19 12:07:17] <Tobbi> head8debian: He needs to update translations, and the translators need to translate those.
[2015/11/19 12:07:21] <Tobbi> There are strings...
[2015/11/19 12:07:32] <Tobbi> That are not on transifex yet, I mean.
[2015/11/19 12:08:35] <Tobbi> And I don't have the know-how...
[2015/11/19 12:09:06] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Uhm, 10:1 that he *will* show up.
[2015/11/19 12:09:15] <head8debian> he will show up...
[2015/11/19 12:09:21] <brmbrmcar> I don't gamble.
[2015/11/19 12:09:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: But what if he doesn't appear before the release?
[2015/11/19 12:09:40] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: neither do i.
[2015/11/19 12:09:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: Then we will ship with untranslated strings.
[2015/11/19 12:09:51] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's not a big deal...
[2015/11/19 12:10:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Oh. Well you made it sound like a big deal. :-)
[2015/11/19 12:10:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: Hmm, it would just be great, if...
[2015/11/19 12:10:39] <Tobbi> well, never mind.
[2015/11/19 12:10:56] <brmbrmcar> So an incomplete 0.4.0.
[2015/11/19 12:11:46] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes... i understand.

[2015/11/19 12:27:52] <Tobbi> yes, don't know the filename, though.
[2015/11/19 12:28:16] <Hume2> It's in Bonus Island 3, isn't it?
[2015/11/19 12:28:48] <Tobbi> Hume2: Not that I know of, I believe it's in CT. dabomb's level sets.
[2015/11/19 12:29:36] <brmbrmcar> Console isn't giving any clues to the filename.
[2015/11/19 12:30:05] <brmbrmcar> for-haul.st;
[2015/11/19 12:30:12] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/19 12:30:14] <Tobbi> Exactly.
[2015/11/19 12:30:15] <Tobbi> for-haul.stl
[2015/11/19 12:31:10] <brmbrmcar> Have the deliberately covered the level with white?
[2015/11/19 12:32:39] <Tobbi> covered the level with white?
[2015/11/19 12:32:48] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/19 12:33:01] <brmbrmcar> You can't erase the stuff onthe second sector.
[2015/11/19 12:33:24] <Tobbi> Aha.
[2015/11/19 12:33:25] <Tobbi> Not sure.
[2015/11/19 12:33:55] <brmbrmcar> Why would they do it though?
[2015/11/19 12:33:59] <Hume2> Well, in my opinion, the icecrusher are wrongly placed, because one of them is in a wall.

[2015/11/19 12:37:42] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yes, that's true.
[2015/11/19 12:37:50] <Tobbi> Not sure if it's worth fixing, then.
[2015/11/19 12:38:28] <Hume2> I've once fixed one icecrusher related bug, related to the same level.
[2015/11/19 12:38:42] <brmbrmcar> Oh yes.
[2015/11/19 12:38:44] <Hume2> So choose which bug do you like more.
[2015/11/19 12:38:58] <Tobbi> Yes, it's fine the way it is.
[2015/11/19 12:39:05] @ Quit: Karkus: Client Quit
[2015/11/19 12:39:45] <brmbrmcar> If you get an icecrusher to crush you upwards, you can jump up the wall.
[2015/11/19 12:41:06] <Hume2> It worked before, but I fixed that bug I hope.
[2015/11/19 12:41:13] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/19 12:41:23] <brmbrmcar> Have you tried it?
[2015/11/19 12:42:10] <Hume2> Previously it worked with any platform moving up and a wall that is 32px high.
[2015/11/19 12:42:17] <maths22> Tobbi: By the way, the linux builds appear to work correctly, so the issue is limited to the OS X and Windows builds
[2015/11/19 12:42:27] <Tobbi> Okay?
[2015/11/19 12:42:39] <Tobbi> That's weird.
[2015/11/19 12:42:46] <brmbrmcar> Ihad a bug with the Ubuntu one earlier today.
[2015/11/19 12:42:58] <brmbrmcar> It couldn't get the public key.
[2015/11/19 12:44:16] <brmbrmcar> And all the Windows build does is unpackage itself.
[2015/11/19 12:44:25] <brmbrmcar> And create uninstall.exe!
[2015/11/19 12:45:05] <Tobbi> We should assemble a list of things to do for the release.
[2015/11/19 12:45:16] <Tobbi> I mean: Update website, update wiki etc.
[2015/11/19 12:45:27] <brmbrmcar> Create working builds

[2015/11/19 12:47:30] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/19 12:48:52] <brmbrmcar> How long will it take for the packages to be in the repos then?
[2015/11/19 12:49:09] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Actually, the windows build mostly works, but it may not do working shortcuts
[2015/11/19 12:49:16] <maths22> It also is missing 2 dlls
[2015/11/19 12:49:37] <brmbrmcar> maths22: I see no supertux.exe or anything similar in there.
[2015/11/19 12:49:39] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I will test Ubuntu later today
[2015/11/19 12:49:43] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It is in the bin directory
[2015/11/19 12:50:24] <brmbrmcar> It won't start up.
[2015/11/19 12:50:26] <maths22> Also, what issue did you have with the key
[2015/11/19 12:50:27] <Hume2> Should be Tux able to unduck in tiny passages and then get hurt?
[2015/11/19 12:50:31] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I know it won't start
[2015/11/19 12:50:35] <maths22> I'm fixing that later today
[2015/11/19 12:50:41] <brmbrmcar> To be fair,I am using Wine.
[2015/11/19 12:50:50] <maths22> brmbrmcar: So am I, actually
[2015/11/19 12:50:54] <maths22> I should test on real windows
[2015/11/19 12:51:12] <Hume2> Windows is a virus.
[2015/11/19 12:51:14] <maths22> (I have real windows, but that means I have to restart my computer)
[2015/11/19 12:52:21] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It is missing LIBEAY32.dll and SSLEAY32.dll
[2015/11/19 12:52:29] <maths22> I will take care of them
[2015/11/19 12:52:33] <brmbrmcar> maths22: OK, thanks.
[2015/11/19 12:52:56] <maths22> Tobbi: what is specifically broken in the OS X build?
[2015/11/19 12:53:52] <Tobbi> maths22: The executable isn't built correctly, afaict.
[2015/11/19 12:54:15] <Tobbi> Hume2: Unducking and getting hurt is intended behaviour.
[2015/11/19 12:55:08] <Hume2> It's not much real, but well then.
[2015/11/19 12:55:50] <Tobbi> maths22: So, on my system, supertux2 has a size of 6.8 MB
[2015/11/19 12:55:58] <brmbrmcar> Tux should be sent back out the way bhe came!
[2015/11/19 12:56:27] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: This was removed because of the glitch it caused.
[2015/11/19 12:56:28] <maths22> Tobbi: I'll take a look this afternoon (when I get access to a Mac)
[2015/11/19 12:57:06] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I'd like to see a way of walking when ducked, but that's for Milestone 3.
[2015/11/19 12:57:14] <Tobbi> Sure, thanks.
[2015/11/19 12:57:41] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: It was like that in 0.1.3
[2015/11/19 12:58:01] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes. Do you know that glitch?
[2015/11/19 13:00:31] <Hume2> About 10% of TeraTux levels were based on that glitch.

[2015/11/19 14:31:51] @ onpon4 joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/19 14:33:21] <onpon4> Just want to point this out, in case anyone working on SuperTux's graphics is interested: http://opengameart.org/forumtopic/retux-graphical-improvements
[2015/11/19 14:34:04] <Karkus> onpon4: Did you use any code from SuperTux?
[2015/11/19 14:34:14] <onpon4> Karkus: No.
[2015/11/19 14:34:34] <Karkus> onpon4: What about graphics?
[2015/11/19 14:34:43] <onpon4> I've mentioned ReTux before; it's a different game, but using SuperTux's graphics, sounds, and music.
[2015/11/19 14:35:14] <onpon4> Actually, there are a couple graphics and a couple sounds added from other sources too, but it's basically using SuperTux's art assets.
[2015/11/19 14:35:45] <onpon4> Anyway, those improvements I'm looking for would benefit SuperTux just as much as ReTux. :)
[2015/11/19 14:36:08] <onpon4> Or, at least, some of them would. Not sure about the last three.
[2015/11/19 14:36:14] <brmbrmcar> Is reTux even legal? It could be classed as commercial,as it in theory costs money.
[2015/11/19 14:36:17] <Karkus> Oh, okay. Have you checked all the licenses and that out to make sure you aren't doing anything wrong? In the end, those assets aren't yours.
[2015/11/19 14:36:35] <onpon4> brmbrmcar: Yes, it's commercial. The GNU GPL allows commercial use.
[2015/11/19 14:36:38] <Karkus> brmrbrmcar: It depends on the assets
[2015/11/19 14:37:11] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/19 14:37:18] <Karkus> onpon4: I don't think the graphics are under GPL. I might be wrong
[2015/11/19 14:37:26] <maths22> I have tried to work this through before, but basically the GPL is not very relevant to graphics/data assets
[2015/11/19 14:37:39] <maths22> This is why we use a CC-BY-SA license
[2015/11/19 14:37:48] <onpon4> That they're under the GNU GPL is the consensus I got when I asked previously.
[2015/11/19 14:37:50] <Karkus> maths22: Thought so
[2015/11/19 14:37:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats that mean? o_O
[2015/11/19 14:38:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: Unit test = tests for a couple of functions.
[2015/11/19 14:38:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, i *could* work on the filenames for the forest world if i knew how.
[2015/11/19 14:38:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Just rename the files and update worldmap.stwm
[2015/11/19 14:38:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: Oh. So they match in-game?
[2015/11/19 14:38:51] <Karkus> onpon4: Well it seems they aren't
[2015/11/19 14:38:53] <head8debian> in-game filenames*
[2015/11/19 14:38:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh? We are only talking about the filenames...
[2015/11/19 14:39:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: What do you mean by that_
[2015/11/19 14:39:08] <onpon4> Also here: http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=68&t=6631&sid=d4a94fecbf89f594e6e4128d8fd11227#p66510
[2015/11/19 14:39:08] <Tobbi> By "in game filenames"?
[2015/11/19 14:39:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: Do i need to rename the actual physical filename of the game file, or what the name of the level appears to be in the game?
[2015/11/19 14:39:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: What license are the assets under?
[2015/11/19 14:40:00] <head8debian> I don't know how to put it simpler than that.
[2015/11/19 14:40:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: Rename the .stl file and change the reference in the stwm file.
[2015/11/19 14:40:25] <Tobbi> makes sense?
[2015/11/19 14:40:34] <onpon4> But if it's true that SuperTux's graphics are not under the GNU GPL, then they are *proprietary*, because no file indicates any other license. And that would make SuperTux unfit for inclusion in Debian, meaning you have to replace *all* the graphics.
[2015/11/19 14:40:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's a good question... I'd say they are under the GPL...
[2015/11/19 14:40:50] <onpon4> I don't think that's the case.
[2015/11/19 14:41:02] <Tobbi> I don't have other information, but let me look.
[2015/11/19 14:41:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes.
[2015/11/19 14:41:51] <Karkus> onpon4: Proprietary != not GPL though
[2015/11/19 14:42:47] <Karkus> onpon4: I thought proprietary was a code term anyway
[2015/11/19 14:42:56] <onpon4> Karkus: If no license is specified, proprietary is the default. The only possible license I see that can apply to SuperTux's graphics is the GNU GPL, and it looks to me like that was the intention of the artists.
[2015/11/19 14:43:14] <onpon4> Karkus: Culture can be libre or proprietary, too.
[2015/11/19 14:43:46] <Karkus> Hmm I guess it can
[2015/11/19 14:43:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: Only thing I can find is https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/AUTHORS
[2015/11/19 14:44:48] <maths22> onpon4: They are some combination of GPL and CC-BY-SA

[2015/11/19 14:51:31] <maths22> Unfourtniately, nothing actually says that for the graphics assets
[2015/11/19 14:51:50] <maths22> Therefore, they are technically only GPL (unless I find an old LICENSE file)
[2015/11/19 14:52:46] <brmbrmcar> So...
[2015/11/19 14:53:08] <Karkus> onpon4: What license is ReTux under?
[2015/11/19 14:53:17] <maths22> The real issue is just that the GPL applies rather poorly to assets
[2015/11/19 14:53:22] <onpon4> Karkus: The code is under the GNU GPL.
[2015/11/19 14:53:48] <onpon4> As are all the rest of the things I made from scratch (like levels).
[2015/11/19 14:53:52] <brmbrmcar> How does that work?
[2015/11/19 14:53:59] <Karkus> onpon4: So if a person bought the game, you'd show them the code?
[2015/11/19 14:54:19] <onpon4> Karkus: Of course. The backers already have the source code. One of them has even published it.
[2015/11/19 14:54:48] <Tobbi> onpon4: But that means the code can actually live on github, for example, can't it?
[2015/11/19 14:54:58] <onpon4> Tobbi: If someone else puts it there, sure.
[2015/11/19 14:55:13] <Tobbi> onpon4: Why not put it there yourself?

[2015/11/19 14:57:29] <onpon4> Eh, I guess I could give you a gratis copy, too.
[2015/11/19 14:58:05] <onpon4> Actually, on that note, I gave a gratis copy of ReTux to the woman who did the run animation. Probably will do the same for anyone who does any of those improvements.
[2015/11/19 14:58:36] <Tobbi> Actually, that run animation should get integrated.
[2015/11/19 14:58:43] <Tobbi> Not sure if we can make it before the release, probably not.
[2015/11/19 14:58:50] <Tobbi> But for after 0.4, this might be great.
[2015/11/19 14:58:58] <Karkus> onpon4: We have our own project, if you haven't noticed -_-
[2015/11/19 15:00:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have been thinking: Maybe we can get this guy here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOeP9tztDl0 to update his level set for MS 2.
[2015/11/19 15:01:39] <Tobbi> Plus, he's available an replies to requests, see the top comment.
[2015/11/19 15:03:34] <Karkus> Tobbi: So we could maybe convince him to join us on GitHub?
[2015/11/19 15:04:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yup. I believe, he'd need to adjust the license of the add-on as well, and let's hope he doesn't have any non-free assets in there.
[2015/11/19 15:04:10] <Tobbi> Otherwise, same problem we already had.
[2015/11/19 15:04:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in music???
[2015/11/19 15:04:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: Precisely...or background images...
[2015/11/19 15:04:31] <Karkus> Lots of non-free assets where that's concerned
[2015/11/19 15:04:32] <Tobbi> He's using custom background images.
[2015/11/19 15:04:57] <grumbel> shouldn't be to hard to repaint them if needed
[2015/11/19 15:05:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: The worldmap music is non-free, maybe others
[2015/11/19 15:05:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: How do you know?
[2015/11/19 15:05:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: I recognise it
[2015/11/19 15:05:55] <Tobbi> grumbel: For example that picture of the beach with palm tree?
[2015/11/19 15:06:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: I see...so maybe not such a good idea...But doesn't hurt to try.
[2015/11/19 15:06:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's not hard to change.
[2015/11/19 15:06:24] <Tobbi> Right
[2015/11/19 15:19:06] @ Quit: grumbel: Quit: Ex-Chat
[2015/11/19 15:20:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: I
[2015/11/19 15:20:09] <Tobbi> ve been thinking.
[2015/11/19 15:20:12] <Tobbi> Sorry.
[2015/11/19 15:20:13] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 15:20:16] <Karkus> :P
[2015/11/19 15:20:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's a first then
[2015/11/19 15:20:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I believe if we pass a directory to ./supertux2 instead of a level or worldmap file, it should create a level set out of the levels in that directory.
[2015/11/19 15:20:41] <Tobbi> At least IMO
[2015/11/19 15:20:54] <Tobbi> And display a listing, I mean.
[2015/11/19 15:21:04] <Karkus> Oh, okay
[2015/11/19 15:21:12] <Tobbi> Not sure how hard that would be.
[2015/11/19 15:21:23] <Karkus> Shouldn't be toooooo hard
[2015/11/19 15:21:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: I
[2015/11/19 15:21:31] <Karkus> ve been thinking
[2015/11/19 15:21:31] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 15:21:36] <Karkus> :D
[2015/11/19 15:21:39] <Karkus> too
[2015/11/19 15:21:40] <Tobbi> damn. stop.
[2015/11/19 15:22:25] <Karkus> I've been thinking about Tinygettext thing
[2015/11/19 15:22:32] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2015/11/19 15:22:35] <Tobbi> And?
[2015/11/19 15:22:49] <Karkus> Just a moment
[2015/11/19 15:26:23] <Karkus> When disabled, we just need to set it to disabled and then stop Tinygettext checking there. So we don't necessarily need to unload it. Does that make sense or am I wrong?
[2015/11/19 15:26:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: The thing is: The strings get added to a global dictionary...
[2015/11/19 15:26:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: I know
[2015/11/19 15:26:54] <Tobbi> Karkus: Problem is letting the GUI reload the strings...aka calling _("my string") on the strings again.
[2015/11/19 15:28:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: But, unlike the language menu, we don't want to reset to Main Menu
[2015/11/19 15:28:09] <Karkus> I see.
[2015/11/19 15:28:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: Even if we reset to MainMenu, it still doesn't work properly. I tried that, I believe.
[2015/11/19 15:28:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: Did you work out why?
[2015/11/19 15:29:03] <Karkus> I would expect it to work
[2015/11/19 15:29:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: Nope, sorry.
[2015/11/19 15:29:12] <Tobbi> Karkus: You can try it, if you want.
[2015/11/19 15:29:23] <Karkus> Okay, I will try
[2015/11/19 15:31:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: I see you squished the language pack menu in with the addon menu :)
[2015/11/19 15:32:00] <Tobbi> Karkus: yup, LMH also provided something...
[2015/11/19 15:32:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: Problem is that langpacks have to be installed separately, so if people don't get that they have to install them, they'll get untranslated strings.
[2015/11/19 15:32:32] <Tobbi> But I can live with that for now.
[2015/11/19 15:33:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: Was there a reason they had to be separate rather than downloaded with the addons?
[2015/11/19 15:34:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: Behind the scenes, they are add-ons. What I mean is: When switching languages, they are not installed automatically.
[2015/11/19 15:34:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: All languages are addons?
[2015/11/19 15:34:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: Only strings for contrib levels are in add-ons.
[2015/11/19 15:35:00] <Tobbi> Does that make sense?
[2015/11/19 15:35:04] <Karkus> Yes
[2015/11/19 15:35:39] <Karkus> So, why not look within the addon .zip file for other (language pack) addons, and install them alongside?
[2015/11/19 15:35:50] <Karkus> Therefore, no disabling at all
[2015/11/19 15:36:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: ?^
[2015/11/19 15:37:08] <Tobbi> Uhm?
[2015/11/19 15:37:25] <Karkus> You don't understand?
[2015/11/19 15:37:27] <Tobbi> Nope.
[2015/11/19 15:38:49] <Karkus> Okay, let's say I made a world map, and package it into a .zip called kark.zip. I upload it to the supertux addons repo. Then, I add some German translations to the kark.zip. The game would automatically load this when people installed the addons
[2015/11/19 15:39:14] <Karkus> s/the addons/the kark.zip addon/
[2015/11/19 15:39:14] <red_bot> Karkus meant: "Okay, let's say I made a world map, and package it into a .zip called kark.zip. I upload it to the supertux addons repo. Then, I add some German translations to the kark.zip. The game would automatically load this when people installed the kark.zip addon"
[2015/11/19 15:40:39] <Karkus> The game would fetch translations, if possible, from kark.zip *during install of that addon*
[2015/11/19 15:41:23] <Karkus> Tobbi: Understand now?
[2015/11/19 15:41:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's true.
[2015/11/19 15:41:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: And it's possible as well...
[2015/11/19 15:41:36] <Tobbi> But updating is a pain...
[2015/11/19 15:41:47] <Tobbi> Basically you'd update the zip file whenever translations change.
[2015/11/19 15:42:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: You'd update the lang pack anyway
[2015/11/19 15:42:09] <Tobbi> I know...
[2015/11/19 15:42:17] <Tobbi> Karkus: But, LMH requested it that way...
[2015/11/19 15:42:22] <Tobbi> To have langpacks...
[2015/11/19 15:42:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hmm.
[2015/11/19 15:44:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: Since there's a disagreement, for 0.4.0 we'll leave it how it is. Now let me try resetting to main menu...
[2015/11/19 15:44:23] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/11/19 15:45:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: I mean: Both is possible. Localizations can be included in the addon's zip file or in a specific langpack add-on...
[2015/11/19 15:45:12] <Tobbi> Just a matter of what we actually do.
[2015/11/19 15:45:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh. I didn't know that already worked...
[2015/11/19 15:46:02] <Tobbi> I think I fixed that a while ago.
[2015/11/19 15:46:04] <Tobbi> let me check

[2015/11/19 15:54:55] @ tux|dude joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/19 15:55:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: Currently, are the translations being removed when the addon is disabled? Or just not loaded on startup?
[2015/11/19 15:56:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: If an add-on is disabled, the cache gets invalidated which triggers tinygettext to fetch the latest translation upon calling _("some string")
[2015/11/19 15:56:41] <Tobbi> I *believe* the problem is that this never happens, though...that _() is called again.
[2015/11/19 15:57:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: So, something to do with Tinygettext?
[2015/11/19 15:57:02] <Tobbi> "_" is the name of the translation function.
[2015/11/19 15:57:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am not sure...possibly something to do with how we load strings.
[2015/11/19 15:57:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah, I've seen this before
[2015/11/19 15:58:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: How does invalidating the cache work?

[2015/11/19 16:02:51] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, but only once, right? I mean: only after loading a screen...
[2015/11/19 16:03:00] <Karkus> Hmmm...
[2015/11/19 16:03:05] <Karkus> Loading which screen
[2015/11/19 16:03:37] <Karkus> I've been testing with the level names of the Halloween levels.

[2015/11/19 16:04:50] <Tobbi> I am not sure when its _() gets called.
[2015/11/19 16:05:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, so the level names work fine?
[2015/11/19 16:05:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: Most of the time...
[2015/11/19 16:05:38] <Tobbi> Let me check.
[2015/11/19 16:05:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why would the addon name change???
[2015/11/19 16:06:03] * Karkus is more confused
[2015/11/19 16:06:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, the level names don't work fine, either.
[2015/11/19 16:06:26] <Tobbi> I just disabled the langpack, and it still shows in german.
[2015/11/19 16:06:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: The add-on label, rather...
[2015/11/19 16:06:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah...
[2015/11/19 16:06:38] <Tobbi> Which gets displayed in the contrib levels...
[2015/11/19 16:06:43] <Tobbi> Sorry...
[2015/11/19 16:06:56] <Tobbi> It's quite confusing everything :P
[2015/11/19 16:07:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: Agreed
[2015/11/19 16:07:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, I understand that problem with the label
[2015/11/19 16:08:02] <Tobbi> oh?
[2015/11/19 16:08:30] <Tobbi> Ah, understand probably != know how to fix it...
[2015/11/19 16:08:31] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/19 16:08:36] <Karkus> Yeah...
[2015/11/19 16:09:01] <Karkus> I meant I know what you meant
[2015/11/19 16:09:18] <Tobbi> okay...
[2015/11/19 16:09:43] <Tobbi> I have a feeling this will require a major architecture change.
[2015/11/19 16:09:56] <Tobbi> Because we can't get the labels to update unless we reload their strings.

[2015/11/19 16:11:20] <brmbrmcar> He wants money.

[2015/11/19 16:23:44] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am not sure whether it's just a coincidence, but I e-mailed numberphile and suggested they do Million Dollar Problems :P
[2015/11/19 16:23:50] <Tobbi> some 3 weeks before they released it.
[2015/11/19 16:23:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: And that's the video that taught me. Now to learn it again
[2015/11/19 16:23:58] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/19 16:25:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Did you know the two people who've managed to win the million pounds both turned it down?
[2015/11/19 16:25:28] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know one of them...The guy who went to live in the rainforest(?)
[2015/11/19 16:25:33] <Tobbi> Let me check.
[2015/11/19 16:25:39] <Karkus> 'know'?
[2015/11/19 16:25:50] <Tobbi> Grigori Perelman
[2015/11/19 16:25:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: I mean: I knew the name.
[2015/11/19 16:26:03] <Tobbi> Or heard of that guy.
[2015/11/19 16:26:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/19 16:26:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: maybe it's only one that's been completed...
[2015/11/19 16:26:57] <Karkus> Let me check
[2015/11/19 16:26:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: Did you get anywhere with ducky levels?
[2015/11/19 16:27:03] <head8debian> ;p
[2015/11/19 16:27:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: ducky levels?
[2015/11/19 16:27:44] <Karkus> Tobbi: I was wrong. Only one has been done.
[2015/11/19 16:27:51] <Tobbi> Ah, okay...
[2015/11/19 16:29:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: I wished numberphile would explain more of the millennium problems...
[2015/11/19 16:29:13] <Tobbi> Maybe I should write them again.
[2015/11/19 16:29:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: Just in case the answer pops into your head?
[2015/11/19 16:29:23] <Tobbi> Actually, maybe the others are not that easily explainable...
[2015/11/19 16:29:28] <Karkus> Probably
[2015/11/19 16:29:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's interesting to think about that stuff.
[2015/11/19 16:29:34] <Karkus> and not maths related
[2015/11/19 16:29:40] <Karkus> very
[2015/11/19 16:29:42] <Karkus> idk
[2015/11/19 16:29:47] <Karkus> some are about physics
[2015/11/19 16:29:50] <Tobbi> oh...ok
[2015/11/19 16:30:15] <Karkus> P = NP for example, was probably explained on Computerphile
[2015/11/19 16:30:33] <head8debian> Tobbi: rubberduck...
[2015/11/19 16:30:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh, no, I didn't take a look at them...
[2015/11/19 16:31:13] <Tobbi> Wait, I did...
[2015/11/19 16:31:14] <Tobbi> long ago.
[2015/11/19 16:31:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Screenshot, please?
[2015/11/19 16:31:55] <head8debian> Im busy...
[2015/11/19 16:32:36] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 16:34:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Where are the visable names for the levels in game chosen?
[2015/11/19 16:34:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: In the worldmap.stwm file, I believe.
[2015/11/19 16:34:43] <Tobbi> No, wait.
[2015/11/19 16:34:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: They are defined in the levels themselves.
[2015/11/19 16:35:00] <Tobbi> so in the stl file.
[2015/11/19 16:37:04] <head8debian> I see.

[2015/11/19 16:48:33] <Tobbi> I mean: The source strings.
[2015/11/19 16:50:10] <Tobbi> So, these are templates, most likely.

[2015/11/19 16:55:54] <Tobbi> I might have figured out how to use that.
[2015/11/19 16:57:19] <Tobbi> I'll have to create a new translation file, though.
[2015/11/19 16:59:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: It seems there are some more levels in /world2 than we are using...
[2015/11/19 16:59:23] <Tobbi> Yup...
[2015/11/19 16:59:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Should we?
[2015/11/19 17:00:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh? What?
[2015/11/19 17:00:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Should we add these odd levels to the worldmap?
[2015/11/19 17:01:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: Which ones are they?
[2015/11/19 17:03:18] <head8debian> castle, christophD,forest1-grumbel,Mtn Pass, village.
[2015/11/19 17:03:28] <head8debian> I think there is one more, but anyways.
[2015/11/19 17:04:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: There must be a reason they are left out though.
[2015/11/19 17:04:50] <head8debian> Im done renaming.
[2015/11/19 17:04:54] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/19 17:05:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Good, pull request please.
[2015/11/19 17:05:00] <head8debian> Now if someone would be willing to test.
[2015/11/19 17:10:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, so i have one additional file that i accedentally "git add"ed. How do i un-git-add it?
[2015/11/19 17:10:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: one moment, please.
[2015/11/19 17:15:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: o_O
[2015/11/19 17:15:38] <head8debian> I should have picked these files one by one if i knew it was going to take this long.
[2015/11/19 17:16:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ah! Got it.
[2015/11/19 17:18:19] <head8debian> Uh oh... where is my worldmap!?

[2015/11/19 18:18:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: urgh.
[2015/11/19 18:19:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: I feel the same way. ;)
[2015/11/19 18:19:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: On a related note: I set up automatic-pulling translations from the git repository from transifex.
[2015/11/19 18:19:50] <Tobbi> If it doesn't work, we're all screwed.
[2015/11/19 18:20:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Eww.
[2015/11/19 18:20:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: However, updating it from a file generated by makepot.sh *did* work, so updating from a URL should work as well.
[2015/11/19 18:21:11] <head8debian> Ok, well thats some hope then. :)
[2015/11/19 18:21:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: Unless I screwed up.
[2015/11/19 18:21:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: Lets hope not.
[2015/11/19 18:21:44] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/19 18:26:47] <Tobbi> I never added the translations submodule to the main repo.
[2015/11/19 18:27:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot understand why my worldmap didn't get saved... I clicked the save butten multiple times.

[2015/11/19 19:37:51] <Tobbi> Didn't know you also know spanish.
[2015/11/19 19:38:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: I added a bunch of people to the translation teams. Let's hope they don't abuse their privilege.
[2015/11/19 19:38:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: I just don't know where to pick up. I don't remember all the old filenames.
[2015/11/19 19:38:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh? open the file with a text editor, so you know which level it is?
[2015/11/19 19:38:41] <Tobbi> It has it in the lisp file somewhere.
[2015/11/19 19:39:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: I renamed the .stl level files... and the worldmap didn't get updated. So i have the worldmap with the old file names and the files with new names...
[2015/11/19 19:39:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: I see!
[2015/11/19 19:40:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why did you do that? :D
[2015/11/19 19:40:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: You can check the repository, if you want.
[2015/11/19 19:40:22] <Tobbi> It should contain the old filenames together with the old levels...
[2015/11/19 19:40:24] <head8debian> Ah! That may help!
[2015/11/19 19:49:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uh oh... github is coming out with a new design they say.
[2015/11/19 19:50:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: Wasn't that what I just applied? The thing moved to the header?
[2015/11/19 19:50:33] <head8debian> Tobbi: I haven't applied it yet...
[2015/11/19 19:50:36] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 19:51:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: I believe we should add a script that allows us to package language add-on
[2015/11/19 19:51:01] <Tobbi> s
[2015/11/19 19:51:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Then do it. :-)
[2015/11/19 19:53:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: Not right now.
[2015/11/19 19:54:05] <Tobbi> I don't know how giby normally updates langpacks...
[2015/11/19 19:54:09] <Tobbi> or rather languages.

[2015/11/19 20:13:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Then git push?
[2015/11/19 20:13:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yup, you might need to force-push, though.
[2015/11/19 20:13:29] <head8debian> Done.
[2015/11/19 20:13:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: I hope all the levels work now. :D
[2015/11/19 20:14:11] <Tobbi> let's see...
[2015/11/19 20:15:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Maybe we can put brm to work playing the whole forest world. :-)
[2015/11/19 20:15:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 20:15:45] <Tobbi> I'll quickly go through them, don't worry.
[2015/11/19 20:17:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: Looks good, except that it resets your stats now.
[2015/11/19 20:18:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: o_O
[2015/11/19 20:18:15] <head8debian> I go through them a sec also.
[2015/11/19 20:18:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, it's kind of expected that it resets your stats, since those stats depend on the level filename.
[2015/11/19 20:19:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, i won't go through them... ;)
[2015/11/19 20:19:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes.
[2015/11/19 20:19:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: Cannot really be helped.
[2015/11/19 20:19:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Nope, unless we keep the levels...
[2015/11/19 20:19:59] <Tobbi> the level filenames, I mean...
[2015/11/19 20:20:03] <head8debian> Meh.
[2015/11/19 20:20:09] <head8debian> :)
[2015/11/19 20:21:39] <Tobbi> But, we really achieved something...
[2015/11/19 20:21:44] <Tobbi> updating add-ons on transifex etc.
[2015/11/19 20:23:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Is there anything else i can help with that is not graphics related atm?
[2015/11/19 20:23:19] <head8debian> Well, related to drawing graphiocs. ;-)
[2015/11/19 20:23:28] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 20:23:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yes, program a shell file that packages language packs.
[2015/11/19 20:23:42] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 20:23:49] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/19 20:24:05] <head8debian> I could try. Not sure i'd get anywhere.
[2015/11/19 20:24:18] <head8debian> Especially since i don't have a clue how our language packs work.
[2015/11/19 20:24:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: There are templates in the add-ons repository.
[2015/11/19 20:24:43] <Tobbi> check langpack-de
[2015/11/19 20:24:49] <Tobbi> or langpack-cz
[2015/11/19 20:25:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: But i don't speak de. :D
[2015/11/19 20:25:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: Doesn't matter. Just take a look at the file structure.
[2015/11/19 20:25:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ah.
[2015/11/19 20:26:07] <head8debian> I don't like the feel of a chicklet keyboard. Feels like i am going to break it by pushing the keys so hard. :p
[2015/11/19 20:27:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Anything else that needs to be done visually?
[2015/11/19 20:27:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Hmm...let me think.

[2015/11/19 20:30:03] <Tobbi> I don't know...
[2015/11/19 20:30:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: Only in SuperTux or in general?
[2015/11/19 20:30:11] <head8debian> Thats odd...

[2015/11/19 20:31:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sound is greyed out. :-/
[2015/11/19 20:31:35] <Tobbi> ah
[2015/11/19 20:31:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: Did we change something recently?
[2015/11/19 20:32:00] <Tobbi> no.

[2015/11/19 20:33:23] <head8debian> But why? Every other program of mine can play fine./
[2015/11/19 20:33:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: since when?
[2015/11/19 20:33:52] <Tobbi> I mean: Since when do you have this issue?
[2015/11/19 20:34:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: The last couple weeks.
[2015/11/19 20:35:59] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did we change something in the code / can you bisect?
[2015/11/19 20:36:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: I think its local.
[2015/11/19 20:38:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: ask on the openal mailing list...
[2015/11/19 20:38:40] <Tobbi> or in #openal but it might not be very...you know...frequented...
[2015/11/19 20:39:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: How do i git bisect again?
[2015/11/19 20:39:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: check git help bisect
[2015/11/19 20:42:47] <head8debian> hmm.
[2015/11/19 20:44:21] * head8debian is confused...
[2015/11/19 20:45:09] <Tobbi> What's the problem?
[2015/11/19 20:45:15] <head8debian> Nothing now.
[2015/11/19 20:46:12] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 20:48:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, let's just hope that the source files will update tomorrow. If they don't...well...
[2015/11/19 20:49:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Undo commit time. :D :p
[2015/11/19 20:49:36] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 20:49:44] <head8debian> Everyone panic and call Tobbi! :p
[2015/11/19 20:49:55] <Tobbi> nope, please don't.

[2015/11/19 20:53:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: Can you also update the website to include the supertux editor tutorials written by that guy?
[2015/11/19 20:53:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Must be local. I went back 80 commits and still had the issue.
[2015/11/19 20:53:30] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 20:53:37] <head8debian> If i get around to it
[2015/11/19 20:54:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: "By the way, you may want to add this link to your wiki for the Level Editor - http://dcjtech.info/topic/gaming/#supertux"
[2015/11/19 20:55:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes, i know. :-)
[2015/11/19 20:55:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: I was hoping to make a supetux video but havent gotten that far, and now i have no audio... o_O
[2015/11/19 20:55:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Anyways, i bid you goodnight.
[2015/11/19 20:55:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Ask on the openal mailing list...
[2015/11/19 20:57:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Another mailing list? :p
[2015/11/19 20:57:11] <head8debian> yahoo...
[2015/11/19 20:57:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: https://openal.org/mailman/listinfo/openal
[2015/11/19 20:58:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: I guess that is why i use email filters.
[2015/11/19 20:58:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: What openal version do you use anyway?
[2015/11/19 21:00:03] <head8debian> Tobbi: 1.17
[2015/11/19 21:00:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: I do run Arch now, ya know. :-)
[2015/11/19 21:00:56] <Tobbi> Okay, that seems to be the most recent one.
[2015/11/19 21:01:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: Actually, that was updated 2 days ago.
[2015/11/19 21:01:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Can you switch to an older version?
[2015/11/19 21:02:18] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not without risking breaking my package manager.
[2015/11/19 21:02:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: This is rolling release. Stuff breaks going backwards.
[2015/11/19 21:02:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, then I guess you should really tell the openal guys. This could be the cause of the issue.
[2015/11/19 21:03:00] <head8debian> It didn't happen before hand so its possible.
[2015/11/19 21:03:07] <head8debian> Maybe a reboot will fix it. :p
[2015/11/19 21:03:18] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 21:03:20] <Tobbi> try
[2015/11/19 21:03:30] <Tobbi> Anyway, good night

[2015/11/20 07:15:39] <Tobbi> Hello giby
[2015/11/20 07:15:53] <giby> Hi Tobbi
[2015/11/20 07:16:02] <giby> how long B4 M2?
[2015/11/20 07:16:10] <Tobbi> giby: approximately 1 month.
[2015/11/20 07:16:12] <giby> I should update the translations
[2015/11/20 07:16:16] <Tobbi> giby: I just did.
[2015/11/20 07:16:22] <giby> thanks
[2015/11/20 07:16:28] <Tobbi> giby: So, I changed the translations to update automatically from a repository...
[2015/11/20 07:16:39] <Tobbi> which is this one: https://github.com/SuperTux/translations
[2015/11/20 07:16:55] <Tobbi> giby: In order to change the translations, you run makepot.sh which I modified yesterday...
[2015/11/20 07:17:05] <Tobbi> And then commit and push the changed translations.
[2015/11/20 07:17:10] <Tobbi> I hope this works for you.
[2015/11/20 07:17:17] <giby> that is just the pot...
[2015/11/20 07:17:24] <Tobbi> giby: It can import these automatically...
[2015/11/20 07:17:27] <Tobbi> Transifex I mean.
[2015/11/20 07:17:38] <Tobbi> Ah, yes, not the translations, but the template files.
[2015/11/20 07:17:41] <Tobbi> I am talking about those.
[2015/11/20 07:17:50] <giby> I know with the transfix client
[2015/11/20 07:18:00] <giby> have you updated the po files?
[2015/11/20 07:18:14] <Tobbi> giby: Which ones?
[2015/11/20 07:18:22] <giby> all...
[2015/11/20 07:18:33] <Tobbi> giby: No, I haven't. How do you update those?
[2015/11/20 07:18:50] <giby> Ok, I'll do it then ;)
[2015/11/20 07:19:00] <Tobbi> giby: So, I assume you have that transifex python client?
[2015/11/20 07:19:17] <giby> it just need the transfix client, tx pull then commit and push
[2015/11/20 07:19:28] <Tobbi> giby: Shouldn't we wait until just before the milestone to update them?
[2015/11/20 07:19:50] <Tobbi> or what's the catch?
[2015/11/20 07:20:08] <giby> We should do it just before, but some push before are also welcome
[2015/11/20 07:20:23] <Tobbi> giby: Of course. :)
[2015/11/20 07:20:37] <Tobbi> giby: And how do you normally update the translations on transifex? Before I did that change?
[2015/11/20 07:20:55] <giby> for the pot files?
[2015/11/20 07:21:00] <Tobbi> giby: Yes.
[2015/11/20 07:21:12] <giby> I add them manually, there are just few of them
[2015/11/20 07:21:32] <Tobbi> giby: If we add new worlds, no. :P So, please just push the changes to the translations repository.
[2015/11/20 07:21:52] <Tobbi> It's a submodule in the addons repository as well as the normal game repositoy.
[2015/11/20 07:21:55] <Tobbi> *repository
[2015/11/20 07:22:00] <Tobbi> hope you know how that works...
[2015/11/20 07:22:06] <Tobbi> If not, just ask me.
[2015/11/20 07:22:46] <giby> If I need I'll do
[2015/11/20 07:23:12] <giby> Have you already update on the transfix website?
[2015/11/20 07:23:21] <Tobbi> giby: It updates them automatically now.
[2015/11/20 07:23:27] <giby> ok
[2015/11/20 07:23:29] <Tobbi> From the repository here: https://github.com/SuperTux/translations
[2015/11/20 07:23:37] <Tobbi> Those are the pot files.
[2015/11/20 07:24:01] <Tobbi> giby: Plus, I made an announcement yesterday on transifex that the release is in 1 month.
[2015/11/20 07:24:19] <giby> :)
[2015/11/20 07:24:35] <Tobbi> Aka https://www.transifex.com/arctic-games/supertux/announcements/4818/
[2015/11/20 07:25:19] <Tobbi> giby: So, once again, remember not to update translations on transifex using the web interface, but using the repository. Otherwise, it MIGHT corrupt translations.
[2015/11/20 07:25:40] <giby> Ok
[2015/11/20 07:25:43] <Tobbi> Sorry for being extra paranoid about this.
[2015/11/20 07:25:56] <Tobbi> I was afraid something might break yesterday by auto-updating from pot files,
[2015/11/20 07:26:02] <Tobbi> but it worked just fine, what a realive.
[2015/11/20 07:26:03] <Tobbi> relieve
[2015/11/20 07:28:57] <Tobbi> giby: You update the credits for translators manually, don't you?
[2015/11/20 07:29:36] <giby> yes
[2015/11/20 07:30:16] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/20 07:30:59] <giby> sort by alphabetical of last name ;)
[2015/11/20 07:32:39] <Tobbi> giby: Sounds good. Since there's no script, I'll let you do it ;)
[2015/11/20 07:32:51] <Tobbi> I might develop a script to create language add-ons.
[2015/11/20 07:32:55] <Tobbi> Should best happen before the release
[2015/11/20 07:36:02] <giby> ;)
[2015/11/20 07:37:15] <Tobbi> giby: So, what's your workflow in updating translations? You use the transifex client to fetch translations from there...and then?
[2015/11/20 07:37:55] <giby> use tx to download in the repo.. then commit and push
[2015/11/20 07:38:15] <Tobbi> giby: So, you download the .po files from there...then move them in the right place?

[2015/11/20 07:53:11] <leyyin> I hate translations, and Romanian should not be used on computers stuff anyway
[2015/11/20 07:53:16] <leyyin> it sounds and looks so bad :/
[2015/11/20 07:53:40] <leyyin> Tobbi, https://redd.it/3tgiaj
[2015/11/20 07:54:19] <Tobbi> leyyin: if you continue this, google won't employ you again... :P
[2015/11/20 07:54:28] <Tobbi> leyyin: I don't use google chrome that often.
[2015/11/20 07:55:01] <leyyin> firefox is affected too....
[2015/11/20 07:55:24] <Tobbi> really?
[2015/11/20 07:55:26] <Tobbi> wow.
[2015/11/20 07:56:15] <leyyin> it's worse in firefox, no permission systems
[2015/11/20 07:57:21] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/11/20 07:58:33] <leyyin> I use firefox btw :P
[2015/11/20 07:58:38] <leyyin> chromium is my second browser
[2015/11/20 07:58:50] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/20 07:58:56] <Tobbi> Yeah, same here.
[2015/11/20 07:59:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: But XUL based add-ons won't work any longer in Firefox. At least according to an announcement made by Mozilla a few months back.
[2015/11/20 08:00:32] <leyyin> yes I know
[2015/11/20 08:00:46] <leyyin> I hope they won't suck as much as the chrome extensions
[2015/11/20 08:00:50] <leyyin> memory wise....
[2015/11/20 08:01:16] <Tobbi> No idea.
[2015/11/20 08:10:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: I once met a nice Romanian girl / woman during a Mozilla event. She had something quite beautiful about her... :P
[2015/11/20 08:10:20] <Tobbi> Well, actually, we worked together in the same project...though she was an employee...

[2015/11/20 10:54:48] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: It was a joke. The @ means he is an OP.

[2015/11/20 12:09:09] <Tobbi> Right...

[2015/11/20 12:10:55] <Tobbi> Fixed release date.
[2015/11/20 12:11:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sure.
[2015/11/20 12:11:41] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/20 12:11:44] <Tobbi> So that's settled.
[2015/11/20 12:12:58] <head8debian> Tobbi: So pretty much everything is done then?
[2015/11/20 12:13:19] <head8debian> Unless we need to change our config to support the latest OpenAL. :D
[2015/11/20 12:13:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't know, yet. I'd love to have langpacks automatically download when people select a language...but not sure if that's possible.
[2015/11/20 12:14:03] <Tobbi> And not sure whether that wouldn't cause problems.
[2015/11/20 12:14:09] <head8debian> That would be nice. How do we do it currently?
[2015/11/20 12:14:21] <Tobbi> head8debian: You download langpacks manually through the add-on manager.
[2015/11/20 12:14:36] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/11/20 12:14:45] <head8debian> Well, that isn't extremely hard then.
[2015/11/20 12:15:03] <Tobbi> I am not sure what can go wrong there...
[2015/11/20 12:15:20] <head8debian> My grandma might find it hard though. :D
[2015/11/20 12:15:24] <head8debian> Sorry grandma. :)

[2015/11/20 12:20:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: It was kinda funny. Her computer wouldnt turn on and she wondered if our internet was down. :D

[2015/11/20 12:31:24] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Ubuntu LTS gets pittifull updates after the first 3 years are up.
[2015/11/20 12:31:40] <head8debian> And the packages are *old*.
[2015/11/20 12:32:15] <brmbrmcar> I mean Chrome Os.
[2015/11/20 12:32:34] <brmbrmcar> I will get LTS 16.04
[2015/11/20 12:32:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: Package maintainers will update automatically, won't they? I mean: once we release it?
[2015/11/20 12:32:52] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Isn't Chrome OS rolling release though? WOn't it get updated forever?
[2015/11/20 12:33:18] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not in any already relesed versions of OSes.
[2015/11/20 12:33:21] <head8debian> released*
[2015/11/20 12:33:34] <head8debian> Ubuntu 14.04 wont, debian 8 wont, Fedora 23 wont, etc.
[2015/11/20 12:33:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: Not? So, if people run apt-get update it won't update?
[2015/11/20 12:33:47] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Yeah, but this device in particular won't be "supported".
[2015/11/20 12:33:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: They won't push a newer version to their repos.
[2015/11/20 12:33:54] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Ah,
[2015/11/20 12:33:57] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/11/20 12:34:00] <Tobbi> Well, what a shame.
[2015/11/20 12:34:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: They fix bugs, but wont push newer versions.
[2015/11/20 12:34:07] <head8debian> Yes it is.
[2015/11/20 12:34:11] <Tobbi> right.
[2015/11/20 12:34:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: Otherwise none of these OSes would have new packages, and they would be rolling release kindof.
[2015/11/20 12:34:46] <Tobbi> yes, right.

[2015/11/20 16:04:55] <head8debian> Hey Tobbi.
[2015/11/20 16:05:00] <Tobbi> hey, head8debian
[2015/11/20 16:05:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats up? :D
[2015/11/20 16:05:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: The ceiling.
[2015/11/20 16:05:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/20 16:06:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Only nerds respond that way... :p
[2015/11/20 16:06:17] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, people who are tired of that question as well.
[2015/11/20 16:06:45] <brmbrmcar> What's down?
[2015/11/20 16:06:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: True.
[2015/11/20 16:07:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: I usually respond that way.
[2015/11/20 16:07:05] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: The floor.
[2015/11/20 16:07:42] <brmbrmcar> How id the floor?
[2015/11/20 16:07:49] <brmbrmcar> My floor is lava.
[2015/11/20 16:08:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: But, a lot of people have at least translated the menu principale on supertux...
[2015/11/20 16:08:17] <Tobbi> eeh transifex, I mean.
[2015/11/20 16:08:34] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/11/20 16:09:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: Mixxx is awesome. :D
[2015/11/20 16:09:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: What is it?
[2015/11/20 16:10:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: A program... :-)
[2015/11/20 16:10:26] <brmbrmcar> http://www.mixxx.org/
[2015/11/20 16:10:39] <Tobbi> open source, wow.
[2015/11/20 16:11:11] <brmbrmcar> I like looking at code for closed code stuff.
[2015/11/20 16:11:23] <brmbrmcar> Well, I would like to.
[2015/11/20 16:13:38] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Open Source code is supposed to be better...
[2015/11/20 16:13:49] <Tobbi> as in: Better maintained etc.
[2015/11/20 16:14:54] <brmbrmcar> Yeah,but it isn't as fun to see the source of it, because anyone can.
[2015/11/20 16:15:19] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/20 16:15:31] <Tobbi> Also, alket's quit message is an excerpt from Harry Potter I.
[2015/11/20 16:15:34] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/20 16:15:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: Google should be shot. Have you seen their new youtube and google plus layout?
[2015/11/20 16:15:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: I wondered where it was from... i don't like it.
[2015/11/20 16:15:59] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: Up to which percentage of translated items do you include the lang file...
[2015/11/20 16:16:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: You don't like Harry Potter? Have you ever read it?
[2015/11/20 16:16:50] <brmbrmcar> I've never read Harry Potter.
[2015/11/20 16:16:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: No, and i don't like it from its reviews.
[2015/11/20 16:17:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why not? What's wrong with it?
[2015/11/20 16:17:47] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: I agree there.
[2015/11/20 16:19:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Witchcraft, magic and other dark things...
[2015/11/20 16:19:32] <Tobbi> head8debian: *sigh*
[2015/11/20 16:19:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: That we don't need to infilterate our brains with.
[2015/11/20 16:19:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did you decide it or did your parents decide that you don't like it? ;)
[2015/11/20 16:20:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats wrong with Google plus? Too much javascript. :D
[2015/11/20 16:20:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Both. :D
[2015/11/20 16:20:07] <Tobbi> ok.
[2015/11/20 16:20:18] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Wow. We agree on something. :-)
[2015/11/20 16:20:30] <brmbrmcar> I hate the term "magic".
[2015/11/20 16:20:53] <head8debian> I'm not fond of it either.
[2015/11/20 16:21:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: And what good does it profit you to read stuff like that? Read something that has at least some educational value. Like the Chronicles of Narnia. :D
[2015/11/20 16:21:31] <brmbrmcar> People say I ama magicain because I can use inertia.
[2015/11/20 16:21:57] <brmbrmcar> Read How to hackWindows and Mac by brmbrmcar.
[2015/11/20 16:22:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: What does the fox say has no bass.
[2015/11/20 16:22:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: You don't want to tell me that Harry Potter doesn't have educational value, do you? Because the bible doesn't have that, either... :P
[2015/11/20 16:22:42] <brmbrmcar> Uh oh...
[2015/11/20 16:22:48] <Tobbi> I know...
[2015/11/20 16:22:54] * head8debian /ignore 's Tobbi...
[2015/11/20 16:23:01] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/20 16:23:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am serious...
[2015/11/20 16:23:05] * brmbrmcar hides
[2015/11/20 16:23:24] <Tobbi> Tell me about the educational value of the bible?
[2015/11/20 16:24:04] <brmbrmcar> It does mention some things about how to be good.
[2015/11/20 16:24:34] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So does Harry Potter. We have the good side ("White wizards") and the bad side "death eaters"...
[2015/11/20 16:25:00] <brmbrmcar> I like books about brm brm cars.
[2015/11/20 16:25:09] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: ...and that's where you get annoying.
[2015/11/20 16:25:10] <brmbrmcar> And hacking.
[2015/11/20 16:25:12] <Tobbi> Can't you stop that?
[2015/11/20 16:26:04] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Have fun hacking my SSH connection...
[2015/11/20 16:26:27] <brmbrmcar> No fun.
[2015/11/20 16:26:32] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, I was quite serious about that question: Where is the educational value in the bible?

[2015/11/20 16:26:52] <brmbrmcar> I like teddy bear books for toddlers.
[2015/11/20 16:27:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did you really ignore me?
[2015/11/20 16:27:38] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Did you really ignore Tobbi?
[2015/11/20 16:28:03] <head8debian> Yep. :D
[2015/11/20 16:28:13] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: Yep. :D
[2015/11/20 16:28:23] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I can see his answers...
[2015/11/20 16:28:41] <brmbrmcar> Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[2015/11/20 16:29:34] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/20 16:30:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about other books, like lord of the rings?
[2015/11/20 16:30:39] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: What about otherbooks, like Lord of the rings? (by Tobbi)
[2015/11/20 16:30:58] <Tobbi> Can you un-ignore me, please? I didn't say anything offensive
[2015/11/20 16:31:00] <Tobbi> Not remotely.
[2015/11/20 16:31:22] <head8debian> Ive never read it, but have never had any intrest in reading it either.
[2015/11/20 16:31:46] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Can you un-ignore Tobbi, please? Tobbi didn't say anything offensiv
[2015/11/20 16:32:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im not big into very popular books...
[2015/11/20 16:32:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: OKay...that I can understand.
[2015/11/20 16:32:55] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Did you un-ignore?
[2015/11/20 16:33:03] <head8debian> I actually have not read much lately. :-)
[2015/11/20 16:33:17] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Uhm, how would i answer his questions otherwise?
[2015/11/20 16:33:36] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/20 16:33:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, basically... Everything has to be taken with a grain of salt... And the "magic" in Harry Potter is just not the central topic there... It's the relationships between the characters...
[2015/11/20 16:34:05] <brmbrmcar> Most popular books are rubbish.
[2015/11/20 16:34:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: I still have no interest in it...
[2015/11/20 16:34:13] <Tobbi> I am just saying.
[2015/11/20 16:34:22] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What popular books have you read?
[2015/11/20 16:34:43] <brmbrmcar> Er...
[2015/11/20 16:34:48] <Tobbi> yes?
[2015/11/20 16:35:05] <brmbrmcar> I havre only heard about them...
[2015/11/20 16:35:23] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So, wait a second: Your opinion is based on something you have never actually read?
[2015/11/20 16:35:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: I prefer books i can relate to more also.
[2015/11/20 16:35:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Relate to in what way?
[2015/11/20 16:36:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: Harry Potter is someone who goes to wizarding school (just like normal school except the subjects are different), his parents are dead, killed by a very bad man...
[2015/11/20 16:36:12] <brmbrmcar> I only like young childrens' books.
[2015/11/20 16:36:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Like its more of real life!
[2015/11/20 16:37:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im reading this book currently. :D http://www.amazon.com/Teach-Yourself-Electricity-Electronics-Edition/dp/0071741356
[2015/11/20 16:37:51] <head8debian> Actually the 3rd edition, but still...
[2015/11/20 16:37:54] <Tobbi> Okay, that might be interesting...
[2015/11/20 16:38:27] <Tobbi> head8debian: I like this book very much: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Game
[2015/11/20 16:38:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Only 720 pages. :D

[2015/11/20 16:40:43] <Tobbi> or something...
[2015/11/20 16:41:06] <brmbrmcar> Yes... it is actually interesting!
[2015/11/20 16:41:18] <Tobbi> I wouldn't say so...

[2015/11/20 16:45:51] <brmbrmcar> I like good English.
[2015/11/20 16:45:53] <Tobbi> *sigh* I really can't think of why anyone wouldn't like Harry Potter...
[2015/11/20 16:46:11] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Sometimes I think you're someone in your 20s just messing with us.
[2015/11/20 16:46:18] <Tobbi> But, no, you act too immature for that.
[2015/11/20 16:46:28] <Tobbi> But I'd say you're as old as head8debian at least...
[2015/11/20 16:46:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: Thats like me saying i cannot see why no one wouldn't like the Bible or doing what it says.

[2015/11/20 16:48:32] <head8debian> Its harsh, but its what i believe...
[2015/11/20 16:48:46] <brmbrmcar> Is that why you drive a truck?
[2015/11/20 16:48:58] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: :-) Not really.
[2015/11/20 16:49:08] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Trucks are personal opinion.

[2015/11/20 16:49:08] <red_bot> alket, you have notes! [Nov-20 16:44] <head8debian> much better quit message. :D
[2015/11/20 16:49:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, so if you're insane and kill someone while having an episode, you deserve to be killed?
[2015/11/20 16:49:13] <alket> they send the Hagrids dragon to Romania :p
[2015/11/20 16:49:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yep.

[2015/11/20 16:49:42] <leyyin> alket, yup
[2015/11/20 16:49:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: Or someone told you to kill a person and because of your borderline intelligence you do it without thinking about the consequences...
[2015/11/20 16:49:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: And whats that mean? I only understand English. :D
[2015/11/20 16:49:59] <Tobbi> You still deserve to be killed?
[2015/11/20 16:50:13] <head8debian> Tobbi: Pretty much, yes.

[2015/11/20 16:55:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: okay, so my brother has got down's syndrome...If someone put a gun in his hands and told him to pull the trigger, my brother would deserve to die for doing it?
[2015/11/20 16:55:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sadly, yes. Hopefully no one does that though...
[2015/11/20 16:56:04] * head8debian looks at Tobbi.
[2015/11/20 16:56:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: There is no way on earth that he can be considered responsible for what he did...You never make exceptions, do you?
[2015/11/20 16:57:00] <Tobbi> This is cruel.
[2015/11/20 16:57:09] * brmbrmcar is confused...
[2015/11/20 16:57:18] <head8debian> It is cruel, but its what i belive to be correct.
[2015/11/20 16:57:30] <head8debian> I do belive in a couple exceptions though.
[2015/11/20 16:57:50] <brmbrmcar> You believe an exact set of things?
[2015/11/20 16:58:07] <head8debian> If you shoot out of self defence and kill someone i belive that as an exception.
[2015/11/20 16:58:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, assume the following: Two patients were fatally hurt and a doctor doesn't have time to treat both of them, so he has to make a choice whom to treat and the other one dies. Does the doctor deserve to be killed for making a choice?
[2015/11/20 16:58:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: No, he did not willingly kill the person.
[2015/11/20 16:58:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: Neither did my brother whom I give the gun.
[2015/11/20 16:58:48] <brmbrmcar> Get another doctor?
[2015/11/20 16:58:51] <Tobbi> Where do you draw the line.
[2015/11/20 16:58:53] <head8debian> I would probably consider your brother an exception also...
[2015/11/20 16:58:55] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I am very serious.
[2015/11/20 16:58:57] <head8debian> Im thinking. :-)
[2015/11/20 16:59:08] <head8debian> Ive never had to draw this line so deep before...
[2015/11/20 16:59:23] @ Quit: alket: Remote host closed the connection
[2015/11/20 17:00:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: I'd consider you the one to have to die if you gave your brother the gun *and* told your brother to go kill someone...
[2015/11/20 17:00:23] <head8debian> Yes, im puting it bluntly, but you asked.
[2015/11/20 17:00:28] <Tobbi> It's okay...
[2015/11/20 17:00:39] <Tobbi> You making up your mind was all I wanted, really.
[2015/11/20 17:01:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: What if I didn't tell my brother to kill the person?
[2015/11/20 17:01:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: If he did it without any guidance i would probably consider it an exception...
[2015/11/20 17:01:21] <Tobbi> but still gave him the gun?
[2015/11/20 17:01:31] <head8debian> WHy would you give him a gun?
[2015/11/20 17:01:50] <Tobbi> head8debian: *that* is a good question...But assuming I did give him the gun...just because...
[2015/11/20 17:01:51] <head8debian> Unless you have some devius scheme in your head. :p
[2015/11/20 17:02:21] <Tobbi> okay, let's see...
[2015/11/20 17:03:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about doctors who grant a person euthanasia...so the person wants to die because he'd be facing a horrible death otherwise, because he's fatally ill...And the doctor grants that requests, ergo kills that person...
[2015/11/20 17:03:25] <Tobbi> Is he a murderer?
[2015/11/20 17:03:44] <Tobbi> -> does the doctor need to die for granting a wish?
[2015/11/20 17:03:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: But i do know how hard it is to have to deal with people who have "issues" like your brother.
[2015/11/20 17:04:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: It doesn't matter, it was only an example...
[2015/11/20 17:04:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't belive it right that the doctor would do such a thing, but it was the mans choice.
[2015/11/20 17:05:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, but was that choice an independent one?
[2015/11/20 17:05:16] <head8debian> Now, abortion, thats a diferent story. The baby didn't chose to be put to death.
[2015/11/20 17:05:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: What?
[2015/11/20 17:05:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, abortion now: Did the baby choose to live?
[2015/11/20 17:05:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: It would have if it had the chance to...
[2015/11/20 17:06:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: How do we always get onto subjects like these? ;)
[2015/11/20 17:06:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, what if people have sex with the goal to get the woman pregnant, but she doesn't conceive...
[2015/11/20 17:06:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats concieve mean?
[2015/11/20 17:07:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Get pregnant
[2015/11/20 17:07:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: What about it?
[2015/11/20 17:07:19] <head8debian> She cannot help that, he cannot help that.
[2015/11/20 17:07:30] <Tobbi> head8debian: Still, it's a life that was killed before it was born...
[2015/11/20 17:07:34] <Tobbi> Kill both of them?
[2015/11/20 17:07:45] <head8debian> It was a life that was never started.
[2015/11/20 17:07:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: When does a life start?
[2015/11/20 17:08:02] <Tobbi> What *is* a life anyway?
[2015/11/20 17:08:02] <head8debian> Upon Conception.
[2015/11/20 17:08:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: A Egg is a egg untill conception. It is nothing and will be nothing without any interaction.
[2015/11/20 17:09:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: But, wait a second: If the two separate parts haven't been life, how can they together become life?
[2015/11/20 17:09:12] <Tobbi> That doesn't make any sense.
[2015/11/20 17:09:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sex. :)
[2015/11/20 17:09:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, sex means that something that is not alive certainly becomes alive (through witchcraft?)
[2015/11/20 17:10:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its mearly interaction.
[2015/11/20 17:10:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: Is combining baking soda and vinegar witchcraft?
[2015/11/20 17:10:45] <head8debian> That was vague, but...
[2015/11/20 17:10:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Is the combination of soda and vinegar alive?
[2015/11/20 17:11:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: In some ways, yes, but i was using it as a reference. Without the 2 things they are nothing, when they join during fertalization it become something.
[2015/11/20 17:11:49] @ Quit: leyyin: Quit: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
[2015/11/20 17:12:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, another example: Assuming a woman has sex against her will...aka was forced to have sex...And she conceives...
[2015/11/20 17:12:29] <Tobbi> So, she has to give birth to a child...even though she didn't want to conceive in the first place...and she has to care for the child?
[2015/11/20 17:12:32] <head8debian> I don't belive it right for the baby to die.
[2015/11/20 17:13:01] <head8debian> Pretty much, yes.
[2015/11/20 17:13:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: Would you believe it right for her to give birth to a baby she nver wanted?
[2015/11/20 17:13:19] <head8debian> Yes.
[2015/11/20 17:13:31] <Tobbi> head8debian: And what then?
[2015/11/20 17:13:45] <head8debian> Its sad when forced sex happens, but i don't believe the chile should be killed.
[2015/11/20 17:13:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: What then what?
[2015/11/20 17:13:57] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, at which point can a child be considered a child?
[2015/11/20 17:14:13] <head8debian> Tobbi: I consider it at the point of conception.
[2015/11/20 17:14:25] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, so what's the definition of "child"?
[2015/11/20 17:14:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: What do you think? :-)
[2015/11/20 17:14:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: a conveived ovum is just "a bunch of cells"...
[2015/11/20 17:15:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: You are "just a bunch of cells".
[2015/11/20 17:15:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: So is cancer. According to your definition, you'd refuse a person chemo therapy because of that?
[2015/11/20 17:16:00] <Tobbi> As in, let a person die, because killing that "bunch of cells" which is cancer is morally wrong?
[2015/11/20 17:16:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: What? You are starting to make no sense.
[2015/11/20 17:17:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: A fertilized ovum is a bunch of cells, so is a tumor... Since you believe that both is life and neither of those should be killed...
[2015/11/20 17:17:51] <Tobbi> That means refuse a person chemo therapy (which includes killing the tumor)
[2015/11/20 17:17:55] <Tobbi> Is that what you believe?
[2015/11/20 17:18:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: No i don't, because there is a diference between the begining of a life's cells and a cancer cell. We are not born with cancer cells. Cancer cells do not belong in our bodies in the first place.
[2015/11/20 17:19:23] <head8debian> I don't like the methods of removing them, but thats the persons choice.
[2015/11/20 17:20:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: Cancer cells are "the beginning of life".
[2015/11/20 17:20:20] <Tobbi> Of their cancer cell.
[2015/11/20 17:20:26] <Tobbi> They're cells = they are life.
[2015/11/20 17:20:48] <Tobbi> Your body contains several kinds of different cells...
[2015/11/20 17:21:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: Where do you draw the line?
[2015/11/20 17:21:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: No they are not! Its like saying that my motherboard here will one day turn into a printer.
[2015/11/20 17:21:19] <head8debian> Not that my mobo is cancerous. :p
[2015/11/20 17:21:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: How do you define life?
[2015/11/20 17:30:32] <brmbrmcar> Awkward
[2015/11/20 17:31:19] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What's your opinion?
[2015/11/20 17:31:25] <brmbrmcar> On life?
[2015/11/20 17:31:32] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: On anything we just discussed.
[2015/11/20 17:32:03] <brmbrmcar> Well, why just humans?
[2015/11/20 17:32:04] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Or: How would you define life?
[2015/11/20 17:32:23] <brmbrmcar> Er, it is where smething is in control.
[2015/11/20 17:32:42] <brmbrmcar> That is all I'd say.
[2015/11/20 17:33:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Elaborate.
[2015/11/20 17:33:48] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/20 17:34:04] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I meant: Explain what you mean.
[2015/11/20 17:34:46] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2015/11/20 17:35:07] <brmbrmcar> I am talking more physics, the only explanation I could say.
[2015/11/20 17:35:44] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So, how does something look which isn't in control? Or: Are dead things not in control in terms of physics?
[2015/11/20 17:36:13] <brmbrmcar> A computer.
[2015/11/20 17:36:24] <brmbrmcar> I mean in control of itself directly.
[2015/11/20 17:37:05] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How do you define control? Doesn't control depend on a certain... willfullness?
[2015/11/20 17:37:58] <brmbrmcar> Like, of your own body.
[2015/11/20 17:39:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: We humans aren't completely rational beings...
[2015/11/20 17:39:29] <Tobbi> Thus, our motivation for doing something are not completely "controlled" by us...
[2015/11/20 17:40:50] <brmbrmcar> Yeah...
[2015/11/20 17:41:18] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Okay, animals are often driven by instincts...Are they in control?
[2015/11/20 17:42:24] <brmbrmcar> Yes, in theory
[2015/11/20 17:42:32] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: In theory?
[2015/11/20 17:42:39] <Tobbi> Elaborate on that, please.
[2015/11/20 17:44:04] <brmbrmcar> I am confused.
[2015/11/20 17:44:06] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/20 17:45:20] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What is control? Assuming you refused to eat and drink...are you in control of staying alive?
[2015/11/20 17:46:45] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/20 17:46:57] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How, if you refused to eat and drink?
[2015/11/20 17:47:23] <brmbrmcar> Don't refuse?
[2015/11/20 17:47:33] <brmbrmcar> If you couldn't then no.
[2015/11/20 17:48:13] <red_bot> Delay note from 'head8debian' written on 11-20-15 at 17:22PM "I will be back around 10PM tonight, sorry to have to run so fast".
[2015/11/20 17:48:30] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: But, wait, you said that you are in total control...
[2015/11/20 17:48:44] <brmbrmcar> Not of death.
[2015/11/20 17:48:58] <brmbrmcar> I am not thinking religously.
[2015/11/20 17:49:49] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Total control would mean being objective regarding everything right? Because otherwise, your control would be biased...
[2015/11/20 17:49:57] <Tobbi> And thus you wouldn't have total unbiased control...
[2015/11/20 17:50:11] <Tobbi> However, humans are never unbiased.
[2015/11/20 17:50:20] <Tobbi> Our bias is what separates us from machines.
[2015/11/20 17:50:32] <brmbrmcar> Control generally.
[2015/11/20 17:50:48] <brmbrmcar> A machine has no soul.
[2015/11/20 17:51:01] <brmbrmcar> Apart from robots.
[2015/11/20 17:51:16] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Control is only control when you're equally likely to do certain things.
[2015/11/20 17:51:30] <Tobbi> In my opinion.
[2015/11/20 17:51:59] <Tobbi> Control is when you have equal, unbiased choices that you can take.
[2015/11/20 17:52:02] <Tobbi> But life isn't like that.
[2015/11/20 17:52:10] <brmbrmcar> But you are choosing to type now!
[2015/11/20 17:52:16] <brmbrmcar> That is control.
[2015/11/20 17:52:35] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: hmm...
[2015/11/20 17:53:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: assuming I decided to kill a person earlier, and I am now in jail... And I chose to go home...
[2015/11/20 17:53:24] <Tobbi> I would have no way...
[2015/11/20 17:53:38] <Tobbi> Thus, I am not in total control.
[2015/11/20 17:53:42] <brmbrmcar> Yes, that is more physical.
[2015/11/20 17:53:50] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Physical?
[2015/11/20 17:53:53] <brmbrmcar> Your body cannot do it.
[2015/11/20 17:54:06] <brmbrmcar> Your hardware.
[2015/11/20 17:54:17] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Where do you draw the line? Isn't control dependent on other factors as well?
[2015/11/20 17:54:29] <Tobbi> On external factors, like society and the world around you?
[2015/11/20 17:54:53] <brmbrmcar> External factors can be choice.
[2015/11/20 17:55:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Even if choose to, I wouldn't be able to leave the prison...
[2015/11/20 17:55:18] <Tobbi> Or get any girlfriend I wanted for that matter.
[2015/11/20 17:55:23] <Tobbi> So choice is limited.
[2015/11/20 17:55:42] <Tobbi> You don't become almighty only because you have a choice.
[2015/11/20 17:56:05] <brmbrmcar> You can't write an operating system to make your computer waterproof.
[2015/11/20 17:56:25] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So you're not in total control...
[2015/11/20 17:56:30] <brmbrmcar> But you can make it play SuperTux.
[2015/11/20 17:56:38] <Tobbi> Your choice is severely limited by external factors...
[2015/11/20 17:56:44] <brmbrmcar> But it can't always hack.
[2015/11/20 17:57:42] <brmbrmcar> That is my best explanation.
[2015/11/20 17:58:08] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: My point is: If your choice is limited by external factors, that means you're not in total control...
[2015/11/20 17:59:10] <brmbrmcar> Exactly.
[2015/11/20 17:59:32] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: But that means you're not alive.
[2015/11/20 18:00:01] <brmbrmcar> How?
[2015/11/20 18:00:07] <brmbrmcar> I have a soul.
[2015/11/20 18:00:19] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Since your definition of "being alive" is "being in control"...
[2015/11/20 18:00:21] <Tobbi> But you're not in control...
[2015/11/20 18:00:30] <Tobbi> there are things beyond your control.
[2015/11/20 18:01:13] <brmbrmcar> Being alive is having a soul.
[2015/11/20 18:01:20] <brmbrmcar> And the control.
[2015/11/20 18:01:38] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How do you define having a soul?
[2015/11/20 18:01:54] <brmbrmcar> Soemthing you xan think with.
[2015/11/20 18:02:01] <brmbrmcar> Choose tothink with.
[2015/11/20 18:02:14] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So anything which can think is alive?
[2015/11/20 18:02:23] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What about plants...do plants "think"?
[2015/11/20 18:02:26] <Tobbi> How do you define thinking?
[2015/11/20 18:02:49] <Tobbi> Plants adapt to the environment around them, I believe without thinking...Thus they're not alive?
[2015/11/20 18:03:39] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/20 18:04:05] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Okay, but bacteria don't think either. Not alive?
[2015/11/20 18:04:10] <Tobbi> Or cancer cells...
[2015/11/20 18:04:14] <Tobbi> Or fertilized ovae.
[2015/11/20 18:04:23] <Tobbi> So, all of these things are not alive?
[2015/11/20 18:06:29] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/20 18:06:41] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/20 18:06:55] <brmbrmcar> Who said they wre?
[2015/11/20 18:06:58] @ alket joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/20 18:07:06] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: But you are a collection of cells... So if these are not alive because themselves they don't think...how can the resulting human be alive?
[2015/11/20 18:07:29] <brmbrmcar> I am not a scientist.

[2015/11/20 19:53:55] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2015/11/20 19:54:06] <Karkus> Tobbi: What do you mean?
[2015/11/20 19:54:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: I updated localizations on transifex, using makepot.sh to create the files.
[2015/11/20 19:54:30] <Tobbi> I set it to update automatically from a git submodule, and even that worked.
[2015/11/20 19:54:33] <Tobbi> I was quite surprised.
[2015/11/20 19:54:41] <Tobbi> I expected localizations to be lost.

[2015/11/21 08:56:22] <Tobbi> let me try to get a better stacktrace.
[2015/11/21 08:56:36] <grumbel> the libsupertux2 is needed for googletest, if you build with 'cmake .. -DBUILD_TEST=ON' it will create supertux2 and test_supertux2
[2015/11/21 08:56:43] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/11/21 08:56:56] <grumbel> run with supertux --debug, that should print the file where it goes broke
[2015/11/21 08:57:42] <Tobbi> Yes, one moment.
[2015/11/21 08:57:55] <Tobbi> my gdb is going mad right now.

[2015/11/21 09:01:06] <grumbel> you could try compiling sexp-cpp with: cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWARNINGS=ON -DWERROR=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
[2015/11/21 09:01:14] <Tobbi> okay...

[2015/11/21 09:02:59] <grumbel> compiling supertux with 'cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON' and then running 'build/test_supertux2' is also worth a try

[2015/11/21 09:23:42] <Tobbi> Value::Destroy() calls the destructor of m_cons.
[2015/11/21 09:23:55] <Tobbi> Which in turn calls Value::Destroy()
[2015/11/21 09:23:58] <Tobbi> At least that|s what I can see..
[2015/11/21 09:24:20] <grumbel> it should be calling destroy() on another sexp::Value, not on the same
[2015/11/21 09:24:31] <grumbel> it's probably some invalid pointer dereference foobar
[2015/11/21 09:25:33] <Tobbi> I already checked against NULL...doesn|t make any difference.

[2015/11/21 09:36:10] <Tobbi> Or one of hume's?
[2015/11/21 09:39:04] <Karkus> It's impossible trying to find a level when you don't know which of christoph1, christoph2 and christoph3 it is

[2015/11/21 09:48:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, an issue regarding the way stats are saved.
[2015/11/21 09:49:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes...Something like "Rework stats"
[2015/11/21 09:49:15] <Tobbi> Or something.
[2015/11/21 09:49:19] <Tobbi> I don't know.
[2015/11/21 09:49:38] <Tobbi> We could save an arbitrary ID in the stl file...
[2015/11/21 09:49:42] <Tobbi> and then set that...
[2015/11/21 09:49:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: But then again, the forest world isn't exactly supposed to be stable anyway, so we could merge this now...
[2015/11/21 09:49:59] <Tobbi> Yes, that's true.
[2015/11/21 09:50:09] <Tobbi> It's not supposed to be stable until about now :P
[2015/11/21 09:50:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: I reckon we do both
[2015/11/21 09:50:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, it just isn't

[2015/11/21 10:01:53] <Tobbi> He's proven himself worthwhile.
[2015/11/21 10:05:27] <brmbrmcar> I can take screenshots.

[2015/11/21 10:34:27] <Karkus> Or does it follow him off screen?

[2015/11/21 12:45:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah.
[2015/11/21 12:45:14] <Karkus> Okay
[2015/11/21 12:46:23] <brmbrmcar> Earth Tux's light should only be an aid, and not react with blocks.
[2015/11/21 12:46:40] <brmbrmcar> Otherwise it makes the game actually harder.
[2015/11/21 12:47:13] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: This is a feature for levels which I have considered basing a whole level around.
[2015/11/21 12:47:25] <Karkus> All light should do this.
[2015/11/21 12:47:47] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but then the light should be 360.
[2015/11/21 12:48:17] <Karkus> Err, well, no.

[2015/11/21 12:49:15] <Karkus> Or maybe not :D

[2015/11/21 12:51:21] <Karkus> Mr Candle isn't a magic block
[2015/11/21 12:51:36] <brmbrmcar> I have a feeling it will throw up a bug.

[2015/11/21 13:14:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: Did i do something wrong?
[2015/11/21 13:15:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, perfectly fine.
[2015/11/21 13:15:49] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/11/21 13:16:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why is that (target-time 0) added, though?
[2015/11/21 13:16:51] <brmbrmcar> New level editor does that.
[2015/11/21 13:17:06] <brmbrmcar> It doesn't make any difference.
[2015/11/21 13:17:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: I have no clue.
[2015/11/21 13:17:35] <Tobbi> The new level editor should be changed in that aspect.

[2015/11/21 13:18:10] <brmbrmcar> Why?
[2015/11/21 13:18:22] <brmbrmcar> It is only time wasting.
[2015/11/21 13:18:24] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: worldmaps don't have a target time at all.
[2015/11/21 13:19:39] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but it makes no difference to anything.
[2015/11/21 13:19:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't know why that line showed up. I was puzzled myself.
[2015/11/21 13:20:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: You can edit it out with a text editor, commit, squash...

[2015/11/21 13:21:42] <brmbrmcar> Maybe target times can be automatically deleted if set to zero, but it still shouldn't bother worldmaps.
[2015/11/21 13:22:25] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Removing it can be done quickly...
[2015/11/21 13:23:01] <brmbrmcar> And anyway, it's a nice way to see if something's been updated.

[2015/11/21 14:16:15] <Fire_> Yeah, my first name would be more adequate to what I'm trying to do!
[2015/11/21 14:16:18] <brmbrmcar> Doyou want to compile Supertux?
[2015/11/21 14:16:34] <Fire_> Trying to compile it on WIndows with VS 2013
[2015/11/21 14:16:40] <Tobbi> oh...
[2015/11/21 14:16:47] <Fire_> xD
[2015/11/21 14:16:52] <brmbrmcar> Haven't a clue how.
[2015/11/21 14:17:00] <brmbrmcar> I am the idiot around here.
[2015/11/21 14:17:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Stop it!
[2015/11/21 14:17:13] <Fire_> I compile it, but when I try to run it, gives the error: 0xc00007b
[2015/11/21 14:17:25] <Tobbi> That's not very verboe.
[2015/11/21 14:17:27] <Tobbi> verbose
[2015/11/21 14:19:07] <Fire_> I followed the steps here: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/INSTALL.md
[2015/11/21 14:19:20] <Fire_> But I had to copy some .dll manually
[2015/11/21 14:22:54] <Tobbi> Fire_: Do you have WinDBG installed? Or some other debugger?
[2015/11/21 14:23:24] <Fire_> Going to check with that
[2015/11/21 14:23:30] <brmbrmcar> Are you mixing 32 bit and 64 bit dlls?
[2015/11/21 14:23:51] <Tobbi> Fire_: Would you know how to get a backtrace? If so, go ahead.
[2015/11/21 14:23:52] <Fire_> Think not.
[2015/11/21 14:24:29] <Fire_> (about the DLL I mean)
[2015/11/21 14:24:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Maybe they are just busy.
[2015/11/21 14:25:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: No. one person walked past me and I said "Good day" or something and she pretended that she didn't hear me.
[2015/11/21 14:25:08] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/21 14:26:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: As i said, she was preoccupied. Just because they may seem rude doesn't mean that you have to seem rude back. :D
[2015/11/21 14:26:24] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am never explicitly rude.
[2015/11/21 14:26:31] <Tobbi> implicitly, maybe.
[2015/11/21 14:26:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well good...
[2015/11/21 14:27:15] <brmbrmcar> Fire_: OK. Er...
[2015/11/21 14:27:24] <Tobbi> head8debian: by the way: Wouldn't it be cool if you could create your own badguys from a lisp definition file?
[2015/11/21 14:27:25] <Fire_> I'm trying some stuff out, meanwhile
[2015/11/21 14:27:57] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/21 14:28:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, maybe?
[2015/11/21 14:28:55] <Tobbi> Or not...I don't know.
[2015/11/21 14:29:18] <brmbrmcar> Fire_: All I could see about the error was 32 and 64 bit stuff getting muddled.
[2015/11/21 14:29:28] <brmbrmcar> Might be to do with Supertux...
[2015/11/21 14:30:03] <Fire_> I'm using the dependencies from INSTALL.md, the only dll i had to copy manually was ssleay32.dll
[2015/11/21 14:30:23] <brmbrmcar> And were the others 64?
[2015/11/21 14:30:36] <brmbrmcar> sslway seems like 32 bit.
[2015/11/21 14:30:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: O_O
[2015/11/21 14:31:06] <Fire_> Others seem to be 32 too
[2015/11/21 14:31:17] <brmbrmcar> OK, then.
[2015/11/21 14:31:25] <Tobbi> head8debian: What?
[2015/11/21 14:31:41] <brmbrmcar> I know nothing about the Supertux build process, so...
[2015/11/21 14:35:49] <brmbrmcar> I want everything able to be made from a lisp definition file.

[2015/11/22 06:15:25] <Tobbi> I need to clear the snow...

[2015/11/22 06:15:38] <Tobbi> You're required to do so.
[2015/11/22 06:15:42] <Tobbi> according to law.
[2015/11/22 06:16:03] <brmbrmcar> Naughty law!
[2015/11/22 06:17:34] <Tobbi> Not really...
[2015/11/22 06:17:42] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/22 06:17:52] <brmbrmcar> It is a pain though.
[2015/11/22 06:18:12] <brmbrmcar> And I like snow because its cold.
[2015/11/22 06:18:35] <Hume2> I like snow because of SuperTux :D
[2015/11/22 06:19:01] <brmbrmcar> :D

[2015/11/22 06:23:26] <Tobbi> Basically, all issues that were reported in the last year and which giby didn't address...
[2015/11/22 06:26:32] <Tobbi> You shouldn't need to re-translate stuff...You can just click the appropriate thing from the translation memory.

[2015/11/22 06:36:45] <brmbrmcar> I haven't a clue.
[2015/11/22 06:37:53] <grumbel> Can anybody reproduce the issue of supertux getting really really slow in --debug mode?
[2015/11/22 06:38:03] <Karkus> grumbel: Let me try
[2015/11/22 06:38:04] <grumbel> Doesn't happen always, but like every second or third restart of the game
[2015/11/22 06:38:30] <grumbel> It's only slow for 30sec or so, then it goes back to normal
[2015/11/22 06:38:50] <grumbel> might be an AMD graphics driver issue, but could also be something completely different
[2015/11/22 06:39:06] <Karkus> It's fairly slow anyway, because of these -> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/labels/involves%3Aperformance
[2015/11/22 06:39:13] <brmbrmcar> No, but I do get the same issue sometimes starting normally.
[2015/11/22 06:42:07] <grumbel> any objections against merging feature/gtest into master?
[2015/11/22 06:42:57] <Karkus> grumbel: I've tried it quite a few times, and I haven't noticed any difference whatsoever

[2015/11/22 06:50:42] <Tobbi> So it shouldn't have any impact on the final game at all.
[2015/11/22 06:50:44] <Tobbi> Thus can be merged.

[2015/11/22 06:53:25] <Tobbi> Not enough to be clearing...
[2015/11/22 06:53:29] <Tobbi> apparently.
[2015/11/22 06:54:00] <brmbrmcar> So I'm not missing out.
[2015/11/22 06:54:35] <Tobbi> grumbel: Couldn't you only build a static library in case people actively choose to configure with -DTest?

[2015/11/22 06:55:24] <grumbel> not really worth the effort, static library doesn't add much extra time, it's just scooping up all the .o files into an lib*.a

[2015/11/22 10:12:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, I even had to exclude squirrel library from coverity because that part is just a mess.
[2015/11/22 10:12:29] <Tobbi> leyyin: People never want to see my code. They don't understand it anyway :D

[2015/11/22 10:13:50] <Tobbi> Why the hell didn't that trigger a coverity analysis? grr
[2015/11/22 10:13:54] <leyyin> Tobbi, you should put your university code on github ;)
[2015/11/22 10:14:01] <Tobbi> leyyin: Part of it is.
[2015/11/22 10:15:16] <Tobbi> leyyin: My bachelor project https://github.com/tobbi/projectgenerator

[2015/11/22 10:16:01] <Tobbi> leyyin: No. :P
[2015/11/22 10:16:12] <Tobbi> leyyin: Having this on github was just not that important to me.
[2015/11/22 10:16:23] <Tobbi> I mean: I didn't really care about perfectionism anyway.
[2015/11/22 10:16:35] <Tobbi> My thesis was 119 pages. I had no way to change that.

[2015/11/22 10:19:59] <leyyin> Tobbi, when you have great power you also have great responsibility :P
[2015/11/22 10:19:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: I have achieved a new low in relationships with society. People in my neighborhood ignore me even when I greet them :D
[2015/11/22 10:21:07] <leyyin> Tobbi, did that happen multiple times?
[2015/11/22 10:21:26] <Tobbi> leyyin: Oh, I told you already, didn't I? :D
[2015/11/22 10:21:30] <Tobbi> But it happens sometimes...
[2015/11/22 10:21:45] <leyyin> sometimes they do not hear...
[2015/11/22 10:21:55] <leyyin> just saying, I do not think they do it on purpose
[2015/11/22 10:22:11] <Tobbi> leyyin: Believe me, they do.
[2015/11/22 10:22:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: I'm really unpopular with the neighbours...
[2015/11/22 10:22:45] <leyyin> Tobbi, ask why, then fix it
[2015/11/22 10:22:54] <Tobbi> Mainly for not caring about my garden, keeping the christmas lights out even when its not christmas...
[2015/11/22 10:22:55] <Tobbi> >D
[2015/11/22 10:22:56] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/22 10:23:01] <Tobbi> And staying isolated.
[2015/11/22 10:23:10] <leyyin> Tobbi, you suck as a neighour then :P

[2015/11/22 10:23:24] <Tobbi> leyyin: I know. But I don't want to be dictated what to do by society...
[2015/11/22 10:23:27] <Tobbi> Thus, I do these things.
[2015/11/22 10:23:32] <leyyin> get your shit together
[2015/11/22 10:23:34] <leyyin> Tobbi, edgy
[2015/11/22 10:24:09] <Tobbi> leyyin: Not really... I believe people look down on me. i'm not willing to contribute to that by complying with society...
[2015/11/22 10:24:27] <leyyin> does not make any sense :D
[2015/11/22 10:24:42] <Karkus> I don't think either of you have OCD, by the way
[2015/11/22 10:25:02] <leyyin> not sure if compliment or insult, hmm.....
[2015/11/22 10:25:16] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes it does. If I comply with society, that means that people think I comply... If they accept me the way I am, I might even get to do the garden.
[2015/11/22 10:25:31] <Tobbi> But since they don't accept me as an equal, even though I don't do my garden, I don't do my garden.
[2015/11/22 10:25:40] <leyyin> does not make any sense
[2015/11/22 10:25:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am not so sure about the OCD part...I had OCD issues in the past.
[2015/11/22 10:25:45] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes it does.

[2015/11/22 10:25:51] <leyyin> for me it does not
[2015/11/22 10:25:58] <Tobbi> hahaha
[2015/11/22 10:26:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'm just trying to point out perfectionism != OCD
[2015/11/22 10:26:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: right...
[2015/11/22 10:27:24] <Tobbi> leyyin: What I want is for people to see me as an individual and not as "just this anonymous member of society", and once they do that they realize that my garden is my business.
[2015/11/22 10:27:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: Because OCD is a far wider problem, it can include automatic thoughts, and other pretty horrible symptoms.
[2015/11/22 10:27:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have had OCD automatic thoughts before.
[2015/11/22 10:27:46] <Tobbi> So, I know how it feels like.
[2015/11/22 10:27:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: I see..
[2015/11/22 10:27:54] <leyyin> Tobbi, you should be more like me, not give a shit what other people think :P
[2015/11/22 10:28:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: It's harder than you think.
[2015/11/22 10:28:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: Did / doyou? have OCD I mean?
[2015/11/22 10:28:45] <leyyin> Tobbi, you know in murica it's illegal to not mow your lawn
[2015/11/22 10:28:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: what? :D

[2015/11/22 10:30:07] <Tobbi> leyyin: haha, I'd get fined constantly...
[2015/11/22 10:30:09] <leyyin> because you are lowering the house pricing in that area
[2015/11/22 10:30:21] <leyyin> Tobbi, then they will drive you out with police....
[2015/11/22 10:30:28] <Tobbi> leyyin: With that many students in my hometown, everyone should be glad.
[2015/11/22 10:32:55] <Tobbi> leyyin: By the way: The scammers claiming to be microsoft don't call me anymore... :-( I fucked with them too extensively...
[2015/11/22 10:33:35] <Tobbi> Unless they call next month...but I doubt they'll do it.
[2015/11/22 10:33:36] <leyyin> cool scammers :D

[2015/11/22 10:34:30] <leyyin> I run arch on my small laptop :P
[2015/11/22 10:34:46] <leyyin> I did not get audio to work yet thought
[2015/11/22 10:35:08] <Tobbi> leyyin: Well, I didn't understand that indian random person (indians all sound the same, no matter whether guy or girl or horse) and they forwarded me to their manager...And once I couldn't understand that person either, after some time of pretending to understand, I was like "Okay, this time I wanted to scam you for a change"...
[2015/11/22 10:35:15] <head8debian> leyyin: *most* people wont get fined for not mowing their lawns. Its mainly in more expensive areas that you can.
[2015/11/22 10:35:16] <Tobbi> And I believe that made them stop.

[2015/11/22 10:37:03] <Tobbi> not sure if they are...
[2015/11/22 10:37:07] <Tobbi> maybe they're.
[2015/11/22 10:37:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: I won't email the OpenAL team until i hear back from someone else with the same issue.
[2015/11/22 10:37:29] <leyyin> head8debian, it's your driver :P
[2015/11/22 10:37:29] <Tobbi> head8debian: You can use a different email address...a temporary forwarding address.

[2015/11/22 10:41:08] <grumbel> Is the console in SuperTux working for anybody?
[2015/11/22 10:41:18] <Tobbi> grumbel: It has always been working for me.
[2015/11/22 10:41:24] <Tobbi> grumbel: Please check what mt said above.
[2015/11/22 10:41:27] <head8debian> mt: Does the git version of supertux have audio with the latest version of OpenAL on your system?
[2015/11/22 10:41:38] <head8debian> Console in supertux...?
[2015/11/22 10:41:57] <mt> what the packaging scripts are basically doing is `cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DINSTALL_SUBDIR_BIN=bin; make; make DESTDIR="${pkgdir}/" install`, then tar up $pkgdir and use it as package
[2015/11/22 10:42:10] <mt> that package then doesn't include the binary
[2015/11/22 10:42:11] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: I like the parody more than the original.
[2015/11/22 10:42:15] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/11/22 10:43:21] <head8debian> mt: Your building from a PKGBUILD?
[2015/11/22 10:43:30] <mt> yes
[2015/11/22 10:43:49] <Tobbi> grumbel: Check the shortcut for the console.
[2015/11/22 10:43:52] <Tobbi> And change it..
[2015/11/22 10:44:02] <Tobbi> I had to change the shortcut as well.
[2015/11/22 10:44:23] <head8debian> mt: Im building directly from git.
[2015/11/22 10:44:36] <head8debian> Not using a PKGBUILD.
[2015/11/22 10:44:43] <mt> well, the pkgbuild takes the git repo and uses it
[2015/11/22 10:44:55] <mt> because the Arch way
[2015/11/22 10:45:32] <mt> better write a pkgbuild than install something to some place and not knowing what it installs to what place

[2015/11/22 10:48:00] <mt> head8debian: music works, but it says `connect(2) call to /dev/shm/jack-1000/default/jack_0 failed (err=No such file or directory)` on startup
[2015/11/22 10:48:29] <Tobbi> grumbel: The console showing up and disappearing is intended behaviour.
[2015/11/22 10:48:36] <Tobbi> That's just for showing messages.
[2015/11/22 10:48:58] <Tobbi> grumbel: Did you try setting the console key to one of the F1..F12 keys?
[2015/11/22 10:49:02] <Tobbi> If not, try it.

[2015/11/22 11:10:03] <head8debian> mt: Yep, fixed it.
[2015/11/22 11:11:14] <grumbel> Any objections against removing the (console #t) flag in config along with --noconsole/--console options? It's all pretty redundant given that there is a developer mode which does much the same
[2015/11/22 11:11:30] <Tobbi> Okay, fine...
[2015/11/22 11:12:00] <head8debian> mt: Well, it fixes the issue for Supertux, but not other programs that were affected.
[2015/11/22 11:13:42] <Tobbi> But SuperTux is the most important...
[2015/11/22 11:14:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: :p
[2015/11/22 11:14:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: I think minetest is a bigger program. :)
[2015/11/22 11:14:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: Exactly! SuperTux stayed slim throughout the years.

[2015/11/22 12:53:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: Do we want all the passwords to be the same also?
[2015/11/22 12:54:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: I set a new password for the twitter handle.
[2015/11/22 12:54:18] <Tobbi> One that I'll have difficulties to remember.
[2015/11/22 12:54:20] <head8debian> I have set up 100 key passwords for our google account and email.
[2015/11/22 12:54:27] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/22 12:54:37] <head8debian> Thanks Keepassx.
[2015/11/22 12:55:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, who should i msg the info to. It *should* be safe to PM the info. Otherwise i can try to encrypt with GPG.
[2015/11/22 12:55:15] <brmbrmcar> 100 different ones or a 100 character long one?
[2015/11/22 12:55:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: uhm...one moment.
[2015/11/22 12:55:25] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: 100 character long.
[2015/11/22 12:55:39] <brmbrmcar> Why that secure?
[2015/11/22 12:56:23] <Tobbi> Unfortunately, I don't have any working GPG keys...
[2015/11/22 12:56:32] <Karkus> head8debian: Now that's too far. Most of my passwords are at least 15 chars, but thats enough
[2015/11/22 12:56:33] <brmbrmcar> There is no point. If someone really wanted to know the password they could hack into the sending of it.
[2015/11/22 12:56:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: Can you set up forwarding?
[2015/11/22 12:56:56] <brmbrmcar> I like long passwords though. :D
[2015/11/22 12:56:59] <Tobbi> As in: Forward all emails to that email address to my email?
[2015/11/22 12:57:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, what do you mean?
[2015/11/22 12:57:05] <Tobbi> I just explained.
[2015/11/22 12:57:06] <head8debian> I doubt it.
[2015/11/22 12:57:12] <Tobbi> really? Can't you try?
[2015/11/22 12:57:13] <head8debian> I can try though.

[2015/11/22 13:19:34] <Hume2> I think that the ideas should go to the forum.

[2015/11/22 13:20:50] <head8debian> We don't need a google+ page if we have a twitter page...
[2015/11/22 13:20:51] <Karkus> Hume2: It's difficult to know

[2015/11/22 13:21:49] <Karkus> Hume2: Where to put things.
[2015/11/22 13:22:02] <Karkus> The forum is less active than GitHub, for example
[2015/11/22 13:22:10] <Karkus> But I agree
[2015/11/22 13:22:31] <Hume2> At least the forum will be more active.
[2015/11/22 13:22:41] <Karkus> Hume2: Hopefully
[2015/11/22 13:23:15] <Karkus> Once we have a list of things there, it should be moved manually onto the wiki, and then slowly issues should be created for each thing.
[2015/11/22 13:25:20] <Hume2> That could work.
[2015/11/22 13:27:35] <Tobbi> We should get a verified handle on twitter.
[2015/11/22 13:27:42] <head8debian> Now we have a youtube page with no videos.
[2015/11/22 13:27:55] <brmbrmcar> Link for youtube page?

[2015/11/22 13:40:52] <mt> /me is actually an ACTION CTCP
[2015/11/22 13:40:58] * Hume2 didn't got too how /describe works.
[2015/11/22 13:41:10] <brmbrmcar> Try /describe brmbrmcar test. It might work online.
[2015/11/22 13:41:58] <Hume2> That doesn't work too: Unknown command DESCRIBE
[2015/11/22 13:42:26] <mt> /describe and /me are client specific
[2015/11/22 13:42:30] <mt> as is /ctcp
[2015/11/22 13:42:46] <mt> this is basically just a PRIVMSG

[2015/11/22 14:06:18] <Karkus> Cool fact: 1/5th of all supertux GitHub bugs are still open
[2015/11/22 14:06:40] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: So, do we close this, or what?
[2015/11/22 14:06:55] <Tobbi> that's not a lot.
[2015/11/22 14:06:57] <grumbel> Tobbi: supertux2 --debug, what file is it crashing on?
[2015/11/22 14:07:07] <brmbrmcar> You can, as it probably a glich with my crouton startup.
[2015/11/22 14:07:41] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: You are running ubuntu, correct?
[2015/11/22 14:08:01] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/22 14:08:15] <brmbrmcar> But I don't want the .deb or whatever.

[2015/11/22 14:08:40] <brmbrmcar> Yes, I tried.
[2015/11/22 14:09:06] <brmbrmcar> But 1. It doesn't work and 2. I don't actually want to install it.
[2015/11/22 14:09:26] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Then why are you asking to?
[2015/11/22 14:09:31] <head8debian> Its very easy.

[2015/11/22 14:30:36] <leyyin> which I can't do because it is my final year and I can't do an internship If I do no continue my studies
[2015/11/22 14:30:45] <Karkus> Were the people there nice, or arrogant?
[2015/11/22 14:30:55] <leyyin> and full time, this answers -> http://www.vladalexandruionescu.com/2015/09/dear-tech-giants-if-you-love-someone.html

[2015/11/22 14:31:26] <Karkus> leyyin: I know...
[2015/11/22 14:31:42] <leyyin> but I do not know to work for a corporation ;)

[2015/11/22 14:33:22] <leyyin> Karkus, meaning?
[2015/11/22 14:33:56] <Karkus> leyyin: What would you do instead of work for a corporation
[2015/11/22 14:34:04] <leyyin> work for yourself....
[2015/11/22 14:34:08] <leyyin> work on your own project
[2015/11/22 14:34:10] <leyyin> indie dev
[2015/11/22 14:34:26] <leyyin> start your own company, etc
[2015/11/22 14:34:37] <Karkus> leyyin: Ah, okay.
[2015/11/22 14:34:55] <leyyin> be at the top of the food chain :P
[2015/11/22 14:35:00] <leyyin> not slave in a corporation :P

[2015/11/22 14:35:14] <Karkus> I typed slave before you did.
[2015/11/22 14:35:34] <leyyin> well they pay you a lot
[2015/11/22 14:36:06] <Karkus> leyyin: But you can't escape the leash to go buy anything
[2015/11/22 14:36:15] <leyyin> meaning?
[2015/11/22 14:36:22] <leyyin> you can do whatever you like with your money....
[2015/11/22 14:36:53] <Karkus> leyyin: I mean, metaphorically. They make you work very hard, don't they?
[2015/11/22 14:37:07] <leyyin> you work as much as you want ;)
[2015/11/22 14:37:16] <leyyin> they do not track you in the office
[2015/11/22 14:37:25] <leyyin> no punch cards, etc
[2015/11/22 14:37:41] <Karkus> Hmmm
[2015/11/22 14:37:57] <Karkus> Can you work from home?
[2015/11/22 14:38:04] <leyyin> on some days yes
[2015/11/22 14:38:07] <leyyin> if there is a reason
[2015/11/22 14:38:12] <leyyin> you are sick, etc
[2015/11/22 14:38:16] <Karkus> leyyin: Do you get 20% time?
[2015/11/22 14:38:24] <leyyin> well, idk :P
[2015/11/22 14:38:32] <leyyin> some people said that 20% is still alive, others said nope
[2015/11/22 14:38:35] <leyyin> so I am not sure
[2015/11/22 14:38:48] <Karkus> leyyin: I don't understand...
[2015/11/22 14:38:50] <leyyin> Karkus, do you want to work for Google?
[2015/11/22 14:39:12] <brmbrmcar> I hate Google.
[2015/11/22 14:39:13] <Karkus> leyyin: I have considered trying to aim for it, but I've had doubts
[2015/11/22 14:39:34] <Karkus> leyyin: This is why I'm speaking to you :D
[2015/11/22 14:39:47] <leyyin> Karkus, are you a student?
[2015/11/22 14:39:58] <Karkus> But this isn't necessarily about Google, just in general

[2015/11/22 14:40:59] <brmbrmcar> You know what kind of job I want...

[2015/11/22 14:42:36] <leyyin> you just want to want it bad enough
[2015/11/22 14:42:38] <leyyin> and work hard
[2015/11/22 14:42:49] <brmbrmcar> I'll get Chrome OS to run all file types, hey? No chance.
[2015/11/22 14:42:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: That's how I got my Mozilla internship.
[2015/11/22 14:43:05] <leyyin> Tobbi, by being a slacker? :P
[2015/11/22 14:43:06] <brmbrmcar> I am not considering it at this stage.
[2015/11/22 14:43:34] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, I contributed constantly for around 3 years or so.
[2015/11/22 14:43:42] <Karkus> Also, does (open source = insecure)?
[2015/11/22 14:44:16] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: But you never implemented MNG support.
[2015/11/22 14:44:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: Worked your metaphorical socks off
[2015/11/22 14:44:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: You're aware of the fact that open source means more people take a look at the code, right?
[2015/11/22 14:44:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, I did.
[2015/11/22 14:44:46] <leyyin> well my dream would be to work on an open source product and be paid for it :P
[2015/11/22 14:44:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: I reckon I'm aware of that
[2015/11/22 14:44:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: Aka Mozilla.
[2015/11/22 14:45:07] <Karkus> leyyin: This exists
[2015/11/22 14:45:15] <Karkus> Android?
[2015/11/22 14:45:21] <leyyin> Tobbi, mozilla is going down the shit drain
[2015/11/22 14:45:41] <brmbrmcar> Android is not open source! But it is free!
[2015/11/22 14:45:43] <leyyin> I still read the new glassdoor reviews :P
[2015/11/22 14:45:54] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, check your facts mate ;)
[2015/11/22 14:46:00] <Tobbi> leyyin: there are new?
[2015/11/22 14:46:21] <leyyin> Karkus, well, they develop their new android version closed at first, but they release a new version down and there
[2015/11/22 14:46:26] <leyyin> under an open source license
[2015/11/22 14:46:27] <brmbrmcar> Well, show me the source for Android.
[2015/11/22 14:46:49] <Karkus> leyyin: But if you've got it on your phone, you can get the code.
[2015/11/22 14:46:49] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, heard of custom roms?
[2015/11/22 14:46:50] <brmbrmcar> And, if people pay for it, they get a nasty bonus.
[2015/11/22 14:46:57] <brmbrmcar> Yeah
[2015/11/22 14:47:09] * Tobbi opens up glassdoor.com
[2015/11/22 14:47:11] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, how do they do it, the custom roms, without the source code?
[2015/11/22 14:47:20] <brmbrmcar> Er...
[2015/11/22 14:47:28] <brmbrmcar> But then there is no cost!
[2015/11/22 14:47:35] <brmbrmcar> That is a different thing!
[2015/11/22 14:47:38] <leyyin> what?

[2015/11/22 14:48:56] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Android must be open source, as it is based off Linux
[2015/11/22 14:49:12] <leyyin> Karkus, *the kernel must be open source
[2015/11/22 14:49:17] <Karkus> The question is, does that mean that it is by definition less secure than iOS
[2015/11/22 14:49:27] <brmbrmcar> Where does the thing actually show the code?
[2015/11/22 14:49:27] <leyyin> any other part is not mandatory to be open source
[2015/11/22 14:49:30] <Tobbi> leyyin: The reviews are not *that* bad.
[2015/11/22 14:49:40] <Karkus> leyyin: It gets too complex for me.
[2015/11/22 14:49:50] <Karkus> All I know- GPL is infective
[2015/11/22 14:49:51] <Tobbi> I mean. There are 3 and 4 star reviews among them.

[2015/11/22 14:50:27] <Karkus> I have no idea how people work with code bases as huge as that...
[2015/11/22 14:50:28] <brmbrmcar> Ah. OK.
[2015/11/22 14:50:36] <brmbrmcar> Where do they charge then?

[2015/11/22 14:50:46] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, charge what?
[2015/11/22 14:50:56] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, are you as student?
[2015/11/22 14:51:43] <brmbrmcar> Like, what is the point of charging for it if someone can just git clone it?
[2015/11/22 14:51:51] <leyyin> ahem
[2015/11/22 14:51:59] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, who charges for android?
[2015/11/22 14:52:06] <Karkus> ...
[2015/11/22 14:52:07] <leyyin> android does not cost money....
[2015/11/22 14:52:27] <leyyin> I know a piece of software that is GPL (open source) and costs money

[2015/11/22 14:52:48] <Karkus> leyyin: ReTux :P
[2015/11/22 14:53:39] <brmbrmcar> Oh, Retux. I tried cracking it, but after about 200 minutes realised that it was going to take days, not minutes.
[2015/11/22 14:54:06] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Or years...
[2015/11/22 14:54:13] <brmbrmcar> Yes.

[2015/11/22 14:54:31] <Tobbi> Or millennia...
[2015/11/22 14:54:42] <brmbrmcar> I thought that it would dive in to the archive and just extract the thing.
[2015/11/22 14:54:44] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes. Uses our assets, new code base.

[2015/11/23 09:00:57] <Tobbi> ah

[2015/11/23 09:08:52] <grumbel> The general syntax is '(section (name value) (name value) ...)'

[2015/11/23 09:10:53] <Tobbi> grumbel: Could we potentially have the parsing on a different thread?
[2015/11/23 09:12:21] <grumbel> Tobbi: not easily, Level loading right now triggers Tilemap loading that triggers OpenGL and OpenGL isn't happy when two threads access it
[2015/11/23 09:16:39] <grumbel> The initial worldmap loading could be spread across threads, as that isn't even using the regular Level loading

[2015/11/23 10:37:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: Which is?
[2015/11/23 10:37:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ask on the openal github page. :p
[2015/11/23 10:38:03] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/23 10:38:15] <brmbrmcar> Always happens.
[2015/11/23 10:38:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: They did give us a solution to try though.
[2015/11/23 10:38:39] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/23 10:40:40] <brmbrmcar> But what was the solution?
[2015/11/23 10:52:38] <leper`> possible workaround is the better description
[2015/11/23 10:52:57] <leper`> (but yes, sounds (hehe) more like an upstream issue than a packaging issue)
[2015/11/23 10:55:57] <Tobbi> badum tss.
[2015/11/23 10:58:40] <leper`> Tobbi: Are you for hire? I might need sfx in a few other chans in case you are and you don't want to be paid in real money.
[2015/11/23 10:59:05] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 10:59:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: What does he want? I don't understand his english. :)
[2015/11/23 10:59:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: You may have gotten youself a job. :F
[2015/11/23 10:59:57] <head8debian> :D*
[2015/11/23 11:00:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's rude to talk about someone else in the third person.
[2015/11/23 11:00:18] <head8debian> It is?
[2015/11/23 11:00:22] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/23 11:00:26] <head8debian> Sorry leper`.
[2015/11/23 11:00:37] * head8debian is being nosey...
[2015/11/23 11:00:45] <brmbrmcar> Has head8debian been naughty?
[2015/11/23 11:00:51] * head8debian nods...
[2015/11/23 11:01:03] <head8debian> Hehe.
[2015/11/23 11:01:06] <leper`> head8debian: they also told me it's rude to talk about onself in the third person
[2015/11/23 11:01:29] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Saturday detention!
[2015/11/23 11:01:35] <head8debian> And why did "they" tell you that? :-)
[2015/11/23 11:01:41] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: From what?
[2015/11/23 11:02:04] <brmbrmcar> You being rude.
[2015/11/23 11:02:07] <Tobbi> Alright, that's enough.
[2015/11/23 11:02:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes it is.
[2015/11/23 11:02:34] <head8debian> Sorry.
[2015/11/23 11:02:52] <brmbrmcar> ACTION 
[2015/11/23 11:03:22] * head8debian goes back to my school...
[2015/11/23 11:03:34] <brmbrmcar> back to my?
[2015/11/23 11:03:35] * head8debian bangs his head on the table...
[2015/11/23 11:03:50] <leper`> head8debian: hm, someone should have asked them that before we got them decapitated
[2015/11/23 11:05:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why don't you bang someone / something else?
[2015/11/23 11:05:57] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/23 11:06:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: ...
[2015/11/23 11:06:39] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:07:37] <leper`> Tobbi: You're having a blast, aren't you?
[2015/11/23 11:07:50] <Tobbi> leper`: What?
[2015/11/23 11:08:15] <leper`> and I thought you wanted to continue with the drum puns
[2015/11/23 11:08:19] <head8debian> leper`: Haha. He always does teasing me. :)
[2015/11/23 11:08:42] <leper`> you mean he's beating the head8drum again?
[2015/11/23 11:08:51] <head8debian> He sure is not the young grouch i first thought he was. :p
[2015/11/23 11:09:15] <leper`> I guess he showed you some id :P
[2015/11/23 11:09:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Any chocolate show up from that guy yet? :D
[2015/11/23 11:09:44] <Tobbi> leper`: Oh!
[2015/11/23 11:09:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: Nope.
[2015/11/23 11:09:50] <head8debian> :(
[2015/11/23 11:09:56] <head8debian> Slow air mail.
[2015/11/23 11:09:58] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/23 11:10:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh c'mon.
[2015/11/23 11:10:11] <Tobbi> I should've never given him my mailing address...
[2015/11/23 11:10:23] <brmbrmcar> Air mail?
[2015/11/23 11:10:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im joking!
[2015/11/23 11:10:28] <leper`> I'd have sent you a picture of chocolate
[2015/11/23 11:10:30] <Tobbi> I know, it's right.
[2015/11/23 11:12:05] <brmbrmcar> Where are the links to the Supertux social stuff you did yesterday?
[2015/11/23 11:13:03] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: https://twitter.com/supertux_team
[2015/11/23 11:13:51] <brmbrmcar> And...
[2015/11/23 11:14:56] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: And what? Thats it ATM.
[2015/11/23 11:15:18] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: If you get us some live footage of you playing supertux i will make a video.
[2015/11/23 11:15:35] <head8debian> I dont have enough GPU power to record and play.
[2015/11/23 11:15:48] @ Quit: brmbrmcar: Quit: Lost terminal
[2015/11/23 11:15:50] <leper`> head8debian: guess I'll get someone to make out twitter account follow yours or something
[2015/11/23 11:15:52] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/11/23 11:16:22] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why did you call brmbrmcar an ATM?
[2015/11/23 11:16:27] <Tobbi> He doesn't look like an ATM.
[2015/11/23 11:16:29] <Tobbi> Not by far.
[2015/11/23 11:16:36] <Tobbi> Actually, guess I cannot know that.
[2015/11/23 11:17:11] <leper`> Tobbi: but if he looks like an ATM that might help with getting money
[2015/11/23 11:17:19] <Tobbi> leper`: Or losing it again...
[2015/11/23 11:17:21] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:17:41] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/23 11:17:52] <leper`> you do use the ATM wrong in that case
[2015/11/23 11:18:02] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/11/23 11:19:15] <brmbrmcar> IMAGINE IF IT WAS WINDIWS!
[2015/11/23 11:19:32] <leper`> WHAT?
[2015/11/23 11:19:50] <brmbrmcar> Twitter is evil.
[2015/11/23 11:20:11] <leper`> and?
[2015/11/23 11:20:30] <brmbrmcar> It overloaded crouton.
[2015/11/23 11:20:55] <leper`> whatever that is
[2015/11/23 11:20:56] <brmbrmcar> That page was more than id
[2015/11/23 11:21:04] <brmbrmcar> is left in my SSD.
[2015/11/23 11:21:08] <head8debian> leper`: Its a tasty treat for a salad.
[2015/11/23 11:21:22] <Tobbi> Indeed.
[2015/11/23 11:21:28] <Tobbi> I like Croutons  as well.
[2015/11/23 11:21:30] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/23 11:21:55] <leper`> head8debian: so bacon?
[2015/11/23 11:22:01] <brmbrmcar> I mean the thing for Chromebooks.
[2015/11/23 11:22:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: We have gotten about 6 inches of snow. o_O And its makign a huge mess since its not freezing out.
[2015/11/23 11:22:19] <brmbrmcar> I want an external HDD.
[2015/11/23 11:22:27] <head8debian> leper`: On salad? Meh.
[2015/11/23 11:22:34] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: You are so lucky!
[2015/11/23 11:22:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: Really? We haven't gotten any more snow.
[2015/11/23 11:22:42] <leper`> you don't have to have the salad
[2015/11/23 11:22:49] <head8debian> leper`: On brocolli salad, yum! :D
[2015/11/23 11:22:51] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Could it be that you're slightly autistic?
[2015/11/23 11:23:06] <head8debian> I hate snow. I have to work in it. :D
[2015/11/23 11:23:07] <brmbrmcar> What?
[2015/11/23 11:23:17] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Know what autism is?
[2015/11/23 11:23:32] <Tobbi> if not, never mind.
[2015/11/23 11:23:39] <leper`> (there is some car - auto pun hidden in there)
[2015/11/23 11:23:44] <brmbrmcar> yeah.
[2015/11/23 11:24:04] <Tobbi> leper`: hah. I didn't even think about that.
[2015/11/23 11:24:18] <leper`> I know, that's why I'm here
[2015/11/23 11:28:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: [Ar] 4d9. :D
[2015/11/23 11:28:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: What? Argon?
[2015/11/23 11:28:34] <Tobbi> Chess?
[2015/11/23 11:28:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: If you give me you address i may give you a pack of resistors for christmas. :D
[2015/11/23 11:28:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: Isnt that Copper?
[2015/11/23 11:29:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why would I want resistors?
[2015/11/23 11:29:21] <leper`> to join the resistance
[2015/11/23 11:29:31] <Tobbi> leper`: Bad pun...
[2015/11/23 11:29:39] <leper`> I've got worse
[2015/11/23 11:29:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: How about a dog collar? :D
[2015/11/23 11:29:59] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am not into SM
[2015/11/23 11:30:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: How about some old SD RAM? :D I think i have a whopping 512mb lying around...
[2015/11/23 11:30:27] <head8debian> Nm. :)
[2015/11/23 11:30:31] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:30:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about chocolate?
[2015/11/23 11:30:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:30:53] <Tobbi> I'd prefer chocolate over anything else.
[2015/11/23 11:31:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: If i can ship chocolate from amazon, sure...
[2015/11/23 11:31:23] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:31:26] <Tobbi> Doubt it
[2015/11/23 11:31:31] <Tobbi> Besides, nah.
[2015/11/23 11:31:37] <head8debian> Hehe. :-)

[2015/11/23 11:31:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: How about a amazon gift card? :D
[2015/11/23 11:32:02] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/23 11:32:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: 1k USD?
[2015/11/23 11:32:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, 5 USD?
[2015/11/23 11:32:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, compromise: (Google Security Bug Bounty) USD
[2015/11/23 11:33:07] <head8debian> Heh.
[2015/11/23 11:33:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: deal?
[2015/11/23 11:33:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: Nah. :D
[2015/11/23 11:34:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why not? Google Security Bug Bounty is almost cheap.
[2015/11/23 11:34:01] <Tobbi> Almost.

[2015/11/23 11:34:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: Want to have a look?

[2015/11/23 11:35:32] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't go to choir any longer...
[2015/11/23 11:36:22] <brmbrmcar> Nice bit of dosh for hacking...

[2015/11/23 11:37:04] <head8debian> .
[2015/11/23 11:37:10] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I remember the days when Mozilla only paid 500 USD per security issues.
[2015/11/23 11:37:12] <Tobbi> Those days...
[2015/11/23 11:37:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Money inflation...
[2015/11/23 11:37:31] <brmbrmcar> Ah, so I'd better hack Chrome.
[2015/11/23 11:37:31] <Tobbi> I could've gotten 15K instead of only 1.5K
[2015/11/23 11:37:33] <head8debian> Welcome Hume2 and Karkus!
[2015/11/23 11:37:44] <Tobbi> Or rather, 9K
[2015/11/23 11:37:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: you got anything at all?
[2015/11/23 11:37:48] <Hume2> Hi, head8debian.
[2015/11/23 11:38:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: I go 1.5K for 2 security bugs (+ helping QA 1)
[2015/11/23 11:38:28] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2015/11/23 11:38:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: They pay you if you fix a security issue?
[2015/11/23 11:38:40] <Tobbi> That was back in the old days...
[2015/11/23 11:38:44] <brmbrmcar> Like ReTux.
[2015/11/23 11:38:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: Fix??? No, find! :D
[2015/11/23 11:38:58] <Tobbi> Mozilla, that is.
[2015/11/23 11:39:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: O.o
[2015/11/23 11:39:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: But that was in 2010...or so...
[2015/11/23 11:39:19] <Tobbi> So 5 years ago...time flies.
[2015/11/23 11:39:32] <Karkus> When you're having fun?
[2015/11/23 11:39:44] <Tobbi> Karkus: somewhat :P
[2015/11/23 11:39:44] <brmbrmcar> If Microsoft gave out money for this they'd be bankrupt.
[2015/11/23 11:39:56] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Yup
[2015/11/23 11:39:57] <Hume2> :DDDDDDD
[2015/11/23 11:40:13] <brmbrmcar> Same goes for Apple.
[2015/11/23 11:40:20] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: They do: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dn425055.aspx
[2015/11/23 11:40:53] <head8debian> Does this link work for anyone? http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/periodic_table/chemical_symbols.html
[2015/11/23 11:41:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2010-34/
[2015/11/23 11:41:25] <brmbrmcar> But they don't pay, they just use other free rewards.
[2015/11/23 11:41:32] <Tobbi> Also https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2009-45/
[2015/11/23 11:41:48] <brmbrmcar> Which is how Microsoft is still in business.
[2015/11/23 11:42:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: I can file a security report against microsoft! Windows is a complete vunerablity! There. :D
[2015/11/23 11:42:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: That will likely not work...
[2015/11/23 11:42:39] <Hume2> It's a spyware.
[2015/11/23 11:42:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: No, probably not.
[2015/11/23 11:42:51] <Tobbi> head8debian: Also, that's not a bug but intended behaviour.
[2015/11/23 11:42:55] <Tobbi> Thus, no $$$
[2015/11/23 11:43:21] <Hume2> Windows 10 is a spyware. If you had another spyware on your computer, you would solve it.
[2015/11/23 11:43:21] <Karkus> I will just say there's a virus on my computer, and show them the fix of formatting the partition
[2015/11/23 11:43:22] <brmbrmcar> Or alternatively I could actually hackWindows and they might not press charges when I tell them the issue.
[2015/11/23 11:43:44] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:44:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, WIndows 10 give me adware, so its bugged somehow. :D
[2015/11/23 11:44:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Still intended behaviour
[2015/11/23 11:44:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: I know, i know. :)
[2015/11/23 11:44:52] <head8debian> Sorry Microsoft, im giving you a hard time.
[2015/11/23 11:45:02] <head8debian> Its hard to please everyone these days.
[2015/11/23 11:45:17] <Hume2> á	Ì²
[2015/11/23 11:45:29] <head8debian> You either have people who hate it or love it...
[2015/11/23 11:45:33] <brmbrmcar> Highlighter!
[2015/11/23 11:46:05] <Tobbi> Hume2: ?
[2015/11/23 11:46:17] <Karkus> head8debian: You're mixing up Marmite with Microsoft. Everyone hates Microsoft.
[2015/11/23 11:46:18] <Hume2> It was just an unicode test.
[2015/11/23 11:47:01] <head8debian> I don't hate Microsoft, i hate Windows. :)
[2015/11/23 11:47:12] <brmbrmcar> Everyone hates Microsoft! Apart from peple who don't!
[2015/11/23 11:47:20] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2015/11/23 11:47:21] <head8debian> I don't *hate* windows, just prefer not to use it.
[2015/11/23 11:47:25] <brmbrmcar> I hate Microsoft.
[2015/11/23 11:47:52] <brmbrmcar> All of Microsoft's money is fromindows.
[2015/11/23 11:47:52] <Hume2> Do never do any banking stuff on Windows 10.
[2015/11/23 11:48:10] <brmbrmcar> Never do any banking stuff onWindows.
[2015/11/23 11:48:34] <brmbrmcar> Any Windows.
[2015/11/23 11:48:37] <head8debian> And why not? Its still encrypted with HTTPS.
[2015/11/23 11:48:45] <Karkus> Key logger.
[2015/11/23 11:48:57] <Hume2> They send the keybord input.
[2015/11/23 11:49:17] <head8debian> Well try disabling Cortana...
[2015/11/23 11:49:22] <Karkus> Then again, Google does it too.
[2015/11/23 11:49:29] <Hume2> So you have to make a macro that changes the nubres, i.e. you press 1 and it writes 3.
[2015/11/23 11:49:31] <Karkus> With all of its products

[2015/11/23 11:50:38] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/23 11:50:52] <brmbrmcar> Actually, I think I have an idea for a fake terminal.
[2015/11/23 11:51:21] <brmbrmcar> Especially easy onWindows, although I did make my computer vunerable.
[2015/11/23 11:51:24] <head8debian> I prefer real terminals.
[2015/11/23 11:52:00] <brmbrmcar> No, you change the input, and display what you actually typed.
[2015/11/23 11:54:45] <brmbrmcar> Nice?
[2015/11/23 11:55:01] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/23 11:55:13] <Hume2> Hmmm...
[2015/11/23 11:55:54] <leper`> head8debian: got you followed
[2015/11/23 11:56:00] <head8debian> leper`: What?
[2015/11/23 11:56:10] <leper`> meaning I told someone to follow you
[2015/11/23 11:56:50] <leper`> (that doesn't really answer your question, does it?)
[2015/11/23 11:56:53] <head8debian> leper`: Follow me on what?
[2015/11/23 11:57:12] <head8debian> leper`: I don't have a twitter account.
[2015/11/23 11:57:35] <head8debian> Good luck finding me on other social media sites.
[2015/11/23 11:57:44] <leper`> might have been a plural you ;-)
[2015/11/23 11:57:57] <leper`> (and you posted a twitter thingy above)
[2015/11/23 11:58:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: OUR TEAM twitter, ffs.
[2015/11/23 11:58:17] <head8debian> leper`: oh, OUR team? Its not *me*!
[2015/11/23 11:58:21] <brmbrmcar> Was there a Supertux Youtube account?
[2015/11/23 11:58:44] <head8debian> There is, but its empty.
[2015/11/23 11:59:28] <leper`> head8debian: yes, but some things also work for the plural case, and pinging roughly a third of the channel is rude
[2015/11/23 11:59:33] <brmbrmcar> Link for it?
[2015/11/23 11:59:38] <head8debian> leper`: :)
[2015/11/23 11:59:55] <leyyin> hmm leper` is here too
[2015/11/23 11:59:58] <leper`> but I guess I can try
[2015/11/23 12:00:03] <leyyin> can't go on freenode without this guy around :P
[2015/11/23 12:00:21] <leper`> Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: head8debian told me to ping everyone
[2015/11/23 12:00:29] <head8debian> leper`: I wish some people knew that its rude to ping half the channel...
[2015/11/23 12:00:34] <Tobbi> leper`: I don't suffer from MPD
[2015/11/23 12:00:41] <Hume2> Does anyone have an access to the SuperTux Youtube account?
[2015/11/23 12:00:48] <leper`> music player daemon?
[2015/11/23 12:00:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Should we give hum access?
[2015/11/23 12:00:55] <brmbrmcar> Come on, a link for the YouTube page? Are you guys torturing me?
[2015/11/23 12:00:58] <head8debian> Hume2*
[2015/11/23 12:01:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: If he doesn't wreck it...
[2015/11/23 12:01:14] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: There isn o channel currently!
[2015/11/23 12:01:15] <leper`> leyyin: any channels you're on and I'm not?
[2015/11/23 12:01:18] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You're torturing yourself enough.
[2015/11/23 12:01:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes or no?
[2015/11/23 12:01:30] <Tobbi> head8debian: If he doesn't wreck it.
[2015/11/23 12:01:30] <brmbrmcar> Thank you, head8debian.
[2015/11/23 12:01:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: lOL. :)
[2015/11/23 12:01:39] <leper`> (also we do need Arthur_* in here)
[2015/11/23 12:01:52] <Tobbi> Hume2: Will you wreck the youtube channel?
[2015/11/23 12:02:08] <head8debian> Hume2: Do you promise to not wreck our accounts if i give you the info to log into them? :) And promise to not change the password?
[2015/11/23 12:02:14] <leyyin> leper`, #unknown-horizons ;)
[2015/11/23 12:02:39] <Hume2> Do I look like I wreck channels on purpose?
[2015/11/23 12:02:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: Plus, promise not to upload any videos of you dancing naked in the shower?
[2015/11/23 12:02:42] <brmbrmcar> What's evil about Hume2?
[2015/11/23 12:02:56] <Tobbi> Not even with a geo 3corners...
[2015/11/23 12:03:10] <leper`> leyyin: I take it that is the full list :P
[2015/11/23 12:03:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: That is the worst joke i have ever heard out of you.
[2015/11/23 12:03:22] <leper`> (haven't played that in ages, not really my kind of game)
[2015/11/23 12:03:24] <head8debian> Hume2: We are joking. :)
[2015/11/23 12:03:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: This is a geo three corner: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Set_square_Geodreieck.svg/2000px-Set_square_Geodreieck.svg.png

[2015/11/23 12:13:29] <brmbrmcar> What is the difference between giby and giby_the_kid?
[2015/11/23 12:13:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: No, Access.

[2015/11/23 12:13:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/23 12:14:00] <brmbrmcar> Are they the same person?
[2015/11/23 12:14:13] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: YES!
[2015/11/23 12:14:31] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/23 12:14:42] <head8debian> usually head8debian and head8deb1an are the same person also!
[2015/11/23 12:15:38] <head8debian> One could be my goat, you never know. :D

[2015/11/23 12:19:28] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Oops.

[2015/11/23 12:20:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: giby has alot of open ports on his network. o_O
[2015/11/23 12:20:19] <Tobbi> ...
[2015/11/23 12:20:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats your IP address so i can scan your network? :D
[2015/11/23 12:20:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do I want that?
[2015/11/23 12:20:56] <head8debian> Just keeping us safe. :D
[2015/11/23 12:21:06] <head8debian> You can scan mine all you want.
[2015/11/23 12:21:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: PM
[2015/11/23 12:21:21] <head8debian> Unless my ISP hacked in and set up port forwarding...
[2015/11/23 12:29:34] <brmbrmcar> I am conecting from home.
[2015/11/23 12:30:51] <head8debian> I wish i had my own IP address.
[2015/11/23 12:30:54] * head8debian cries...
[2015/11/23 12:31:01] <brmbrmcar> I want my own IP.
[2015/11/23 12:31:24] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: You probably can. I cannot.
[2015/11/23 12:31:31] <brmbrmcar> 4913.4913.4913.4913, but they would never allow one that long. :(
[2015/11/23 12:31:37] <brmbrmcar> How?
[2015/11/23 12:32:18] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Look it up.
[2015/11/23 12:32:30] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: 999.999.999 is the biggest IPV4 can handle.
[2015/11/23 12:32:34] <head8debian> Wait.
[2015/11/23 12:32:40] <head8debian> 999.999.999.999.
[2015/11/23 12:32:41] <head8debian> There.
[2015/11/23 12:32:53] <brmbrmcar> I just tried.
[2015/11/23 12:33:10] <brmbrmcar> But I cannot find anything part from my public IP.
[2015/11/23 12:33:40] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Don't worry about it. If you don't know what exactly you are doing you can open gateways for hackers to walk right in and hack your computer.
[2015/11/23 12:34:02] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: And you have no need for it.
[2015/11/23 12:34:17] <leper`> head8debian: Did you mean 255?
[2015/11/23 12:34:20] <Hume2> head8debian: No, biggest is 255.255.255.255.
[2015/11/23 12:34:29] <leper`> or are you working for CSI?
[2015/11/23 12:34:36] <brmbrmcar> And I can only change my settings through Chrome OS.
[2015/11/23 12:34:51] <Hume2> You can use IP changer.
[2015/11/23 12:35:30] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but that won't work for me.
[2015/11/23 12:35:42] <head8debian> I figured it was 255, but i thought 999 sounded cool. I was referencing to it being 3x4 digits long...
[2015/11/23 12:35:51] <leyyin> lemme write a visual basic program to trace your IP
[2015/11/23 12:35:53] <head8debian> 4x3. whatever.
[2015/11/23 12:36:06] <leyyin> *visual basic GUI
[2015/11/23 12:36:06] <leper`> wasn't that s/program/gui/?
[2015/11/23 12:36:07] <head8debian> Why not traceroute? :)
[2015/11/23 12:36:29] <leper`> head8debian: You're no real hacker if you do that
[2015/11/23 12:36:38] <head8debian> Im not a real hacker!
[2015/11/23 12:36:49] <leyyin> yes, head8debian you are on a list now, FBI most likely ;)
[2015/11/23 12:36:50] <head8debian> I just want to keep people out of *my* hair.
[2015/11/23 12:37:02] <head8debian> Huh?
[2015/11/23 12:37:04] <leper`> then go bald
[2015/11/23 12:37:06] <leper`> er bold!
[2015/11/23 12:37:36] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/11/23 12:37:48] <head8debian> I am, i have no IP address, and cannot get one. :D
[2015/11/23 12:37:56] <head8debian> I cannot even get a IPV6 tunnel...
[2015/11/23 12:38:12] <brmbrmcar> You have anIP address.
[2015/11/23 12:38:17] <brmbrmcar> Everyone does.
[2015/11/23 12:38:50] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, I don't
[2015/11/23 12:38:55] <leyyin> I live in the ether of the internet
[2015/11/23 12:38:59] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: No, not everyone.
[2015/11/23 12:39:03] <head8debian> leper`: ether?
[2015/11/23 12:39:05] <leper`> get some cheap vps? (then forward)
[2015/11/23 12:39:07] <head8debian> leyyin: ^
[2015/11/23 12:39:09] <leper`> lol
[2015/11/23 12:39:16] <head8debian> To much money. :D
[2015/11/23 12:39:17] <leper`> head8debian: something you can sniff
[2015/11/23 12:39:19] <brmbrmcar> So if you were to takeyour cloak off, what would it say?
[2015/11/23 12:39:19] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/23 12:39:28] <mt> >Too much money
[2015/11/23 12:39:32] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: My ISPs IP address.
[2015/11/23 12:39:37] <mt> You can get VPSes for $15/year
[2015/11/23 12:39:41] <brmbrmcar> Like for me.
[2015/11/23 12:39:44] <head8debian> Its not too much money, but my parents won't let me.
[2015/11/23 12:40:04] <head8debian> My ISP feeds a couple hundred people on 2 IP addresses.
[2015/11/23 12:40:13] <brmbrmcar> Poor head8debian.
[2015/11/23 12:40:19] <leper`> mt: possibly less if you have some .edu email
[2015/11/23 12:40:21] <Hume2> I tried some on-line IP tracking stuff and any of them could trace me correctly.
[2015/11/23 12:41:18] <brmbrmcar> Not for me.
[2015/11/23 12:42:08] <head8debian> There are people who want a IP address and cannot have one and there are people who have one and dont have a clue that theyt have one.
[2015/11/23 12:42:24] @ Wuzzy joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/23 12:43:46] <brmbrmcar> Then steal one from the people who do not know. :D
[2015/11/23 12:44:17] <mt> but seriously - CGNAT and no IPv6
[2015/11/23 12:44:31] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Thats kinda hard.
[2015/11/23 12:44:57] <brmbrmcar> I was joking.
[2015/11/23 12:45:32] <mt> >kinda hard - get some bgp peering w/o prefix filtering and announce a route
[2015/11/23 12:46:07] <head8debian> mt: What?
[2015/11/23 12:46:08] <brmbrmcar> How do you get whatever IP you eant for free?
[2015/11/23 12:46:17] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: You don't.
[2015/11/23 12:46:18] <brmbrmcar> Without any software?
[2015/11/23 12:46:28] * brmbrmcar cries
[2015/11/23 12:47:12] @ Quit: Tobbi: Remote host closed the connection
[2015/11/23 12:47:57] <mt> well
[2015/11/23 12:48:03] <mt> you can leak a BGP route
[2015/11/23 12:48:58] <head8debian> mt: I think i can survive with it the way it is. :)
[2015/11/23 12:49:07] <head8debian> I have no one's IP address to use anyways.
[2015/11/23 12:49:20] <head8debian> All my relatives use the same ISP.
[2015/11/23 12:50:10] <mt> when you leak a route you usually do that without the owner's permission
[2015/11/23 12:50:11] <brmbrmcar> That is annoying.
[2015/11/23 12:50:36] <head8debian> mt: Ok, then im *NOT* doing it.
[2015/11/23 12:50:38] <head8debian> :)
[2015/11/23 12:51:05] <mt> you can't anyway without a BGP session
[2015/11/23 12:51:53] <mt> and there's ROA to prevent bad announcements as well
[2015/11/23 12:52:11] <mt> however, it can happen that ISPs leak routes they're not supposed to announce
[2015/11/23 12:52:30] <mt> and even if that's a one-person ISP it can actually take down entire Google
[2015/11/23 12:52:45] <brmbrmcar> Awesome!
[2015/11/23 12:52:52] <brmbrmcar> Can you do that?
[2015/11/23 12:53:03] <leper`> head8debian: in case you have an .edu email https://education.github.com/pack and the digitalocean thing might help you for some time
[2015/11/23 12:53:12] <mt> I don't have any BGP sessions in the real internet
[2015/11/23 12:53:22] <head8debian> leper`: .edu email?
[2015/11/23 12:53:25] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2015/11/23 12:53:33] <leper`> as in school
[2015/11/23 12:53:43] <head8debian> No i don't have one.
[2015/11/23 12:53:44] <mt> leper`: you don't even need an .edu address if you can send them a copy of your student ID iirc
[2015/11/23 12:53:54] <leper`> never got that far
[2015/11/23 12:54:04] <head8debian> Whats a student id?
[2015/11/23 12:54:11] <brmbrmcar> What is a Student ID?
[2015/11/23 12:54:25] <brmbrmcar> oops
[2015/11/23 12:54:42] <mt> "Please upload an image of your school ID, academic transcript, or other proof of affiliation. Please make sure dates are visible, verifying your status as a current student."
[2015/11/23 12:55:08] <brmbrmcar> I have none of that.
[2015/11/23 12:55:24] <head8debian> nm...
[2015/11/23 12:55:25] <mt> that shows up if you select "I don't have a school-issued email"
[2015/11/23 12:56:21] <mt> and - any high school, university, college, etc should actually be able to provide you a 'proof of affiliation', as in a proof that you visit a state-recognized school
[2015/11/23 12:56:36] <head8debian> mt: Im Homeschooled.
[2015/11/23 12:57:21] <mt> americans...
[2015/11/23 12:57:24] <leyyin> :D
[2015/11/23 12:57:38] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Is that good?
[2015/11/23 12:58:05] <mt> head8debian: but don't you have to write tests or so that proof that you actually get enough education?
[2015/11/23 12:59:48] <leyyin> I have no idea what you are talking about mt, all this network stuff :P, too low level
[2015/11/23 13:00:21] <leyyin> I never heard of BGP before, TIL

[2015/11/23 13:06:12] <head8debian> Sounds interesting.
[2015/11/23 13:07:06] <leyyin> well I am reading now on wikipedia
[2015/11/23 13:07:23] <mt> btw, @German-speaking people: http://www.daserste.de/information/reportage-dokumentation/citizenfour/index.html
[2015/11/23 13:07:41] <leyyin> seems weird that such a fundamental protocol is in the application layer ;)
[2015/11/23 13:09:01] <head8debian> The more studying i do on networking the less i realize i know...

[2015/11/23 13:09:58] <leyyin> it seems to me this is routing tables protocol for large networks :P
[2015/11/23 13:10:03] <head8debian> And we never noticed. :D
[2015/11/23 13:10:55] <Tobbi> mt: Ja, nee, das muss jetzt nicht sein. Hast du nicht irgendwas Ã¼ber Meerschweinchen, die sich durch Aufnahme von Smarties in eine Discokugel verwandelt haben oder so?

[2015/11/23 13:11:49] <leyyin> wtf?

[2015/11/23 13:14:23] <leyyin> I listen to google
[2015/11/23 13:14:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: And Google listens to you?

[2015/11/24 11:24:03] <Tobbi> maths22: How would you do that? The menu file in which the logo is defined doesn't support #if since it's not c++
[2015/11/24 11:24:03] <brmbrmcar> Is that a good idea?
[2015/11/24 11:24:32] <maths22> Tobbi: We use a CMake .in file
[2015/11/24 11:24:46] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It is a very good idea
[2015/11/24 11:25:01] <maths22> Duplicating code (or levels) is a bad idea because then only 1 will get changed

[2015/11/24 11:25:42] <maths22> Where is the logic for that?
[2015/11/24 11:25:42] <grumbel> ok
[2015/11/24 11:26:41] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I found the logic.  I'll think about it...
[2015/11/24 11:27:40] <brmbrmcar> maths22: OK.
[2015/11/24 11:27:54] <brmbrmcar> But we don't want it to bug up.
[2015/11/24 11:28:00] <maths22> brmbrmcar: of course
[2015/11/24 11:28:51] <brmbrmcar> So I probably wouldn't want to implement anything until after 0.4.0.
[2015/11/24 11:29:31] <Tobbi> ...unless those are really minor changes that won't break.
[2015/11/24 11:29:54] <brmbrmcar> But best be on the safe side.

[2015/11/24 14:33:59] <maths22> mt: Great
[2015/11/24 14:34:12] <maths22> I just figured having 3 copies of the main level is not a good idea
[2015/11/24 14:34:25] <maths22> It also meant that, during christmas time, the development logo would not be used
[2015/11/24 14:34:29] <brmbrmcar> the backgroundchange for the Christmas one?
[2015/11/24 14:34:37] <mt> Does the christmas hat also appear correctly if you're in development 'mode'?
[2015/11/24 14:34:56] <maths22> mt: Yes.  I tested it by changing my computer's date
[2015/11/24 14:35:11] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It is handled through an if clause in the menu.stl file
[2015/11/24 14:35:26] <Karkus> developer mode or debug build?
[2015/11/24 14:35:26] <brmbrmcar> Ah, it changes it all. :D
[2015/11/24 14:35:33] <mt> protip: rather make the code return true even if it's not christmas
[2015/11/24 14:35:51] <maths22> mt: I also did that
[2015/11/24 14:35:55] <mt> maybe we should even add an #ifdef for that for development purposes
[2015/11/24 14:36:06] <maths22> mt: why?
[2015/11/24 14:36:14] <maths22> Karkus: Sorry.  Debug build

[2015/11/24 14:36:25] <maths22> Why would developmer mode affect it at all
[2015/11/24 14:36:41] <maths22> mt: I get what you are saying.  I can add a CMake define for that

[2015/11/24 16:52:36] <Tobbi> thank you...
[2015/11/24 16:52:47] <maths22> I just created these issues so I don't forget in the future that I have this to work on
[2015/11/24 16:53:01] <Tobbi> :) Fine with me.
[2015/11/24 16:53:10] <Tobbi> And post-0.4.0 is a loooong way from today...
[2015/11/24 16:53:47] <maths22> Tobbi: I know, but 0.4.0 is a month from today (at least in theory)
[2015/11/24 16:53:52] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/24 16:54:04] <Tobbi> maths22: We'll make it. 20th of December...
[2015/11/24 16:54:26] <maths22> Tobbi: Also, once 0.4.0 releases, we should rename post-0.4.0 to future
[2015/11/24 16:54:33] <maths22> And we should create 0.4.1
[2015/11/24 16:55:10] <maths22> (future would be for things that don't yet have a specific target, like post-0.4.0 is now)
[2015/11/24 16:56:14] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/24 16:56:21] <Tobbi> Sounds good.

[2015/11/24 16:58:40] <Tobbi> maths22: I know ;)
[2015/11/24 16:58:48] <Tobbi> I only read it once, though.
[2015/11/24 16:58:54] <maths22> Tobbi: I've only read it once too
[2015/11/24 16:59:04] <maths22> I really should read it again.  It was a lot of fun
[2015/11/24 16:59:13] <Tobbi> Yeah, same here.
[2015/11/24 16:59:21] <Tobbi> Maybe this time in English instead of German..
[2015/11/24 16:59:52] <head8debian> Ive heard things about it... good things...
[2015/11/24 16:59:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: Really?
[2015/11/24 17:00:04] <Tobbi> That's weird...

[2015/11/24 17:00:31] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/11/24 17:00:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's a shame when you publicly critize a Christian for being hypocritical and he doesn't even reply...
[2015/11/24 17:00:58] <Tobbi> Know that feeling? :P
[2015/11/24 17:01:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: ?

[2015/11/24 17:01:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, there's this guy at Mozilla, whom I didn't like for being too Christian and too provocative...He wore a shirt with "Ask me about Jesus" at a public mozilla event on purpose.
[2015/11/24 17:01:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: sure, go ahead.

[2015/11/24 17:06:22] <Tobbi> We have no true account of what the Pilgrims ate that day, but from what we know we can safely guess that they feasted on Duck,  Rabbit, Lobsters,  roasted venison,  boiled turkey,  fish and stewed pumpkin. (what?)
[2015/11/24 17:06:36] <Tobbi> How do you know it if you don't have any accounts of it?
[2015/11/24 17:06:44] <Tobbi> I believe God liked to play counter strike
[2015/11/24 17:06:53] <Tobbi> It can never be read anywhere, though.
[2015/11/24 17:06:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: we can safely guess...

[2015/11/24 17:09:53] <Tobbi> Oh wait, you don't have those in America.
[2015/11/24 17:10:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: WHat do you think of it over all?
[2015/11/24 17:11:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh, I didn't read it, I just checked for spelling mistakes.
[2015/11/24 17:11:44] <head8debian> :p

[2015/11/25 10:45:35] <grumbel> Has anybody ever used the support for multiple tilesets inside a level (i.e. the (tilesets ...) tag in .stl files)?
[2015/11/25 10:46:42] <grumbel> I feel tempted to remove it, as it turns the code into a bit of a mess
[2015/11/25 10:47:06] <grumbel> Could also be cleaner implemented inside the tileset instead of inside the level files
[2015/11/25 10:47:25] <brmbrmcar> It seems useful although I have nevr used it.
[2015/11/25 10:49:20] <grumbel> The only level that uses them is ./data/levels/test_old/tilesets.stl and that one doesn't even work
[2015/11/25 10:49:51] <brmbrmcar> I would use it, but I nothing about tilesets myself.
[2015/11/25 10:50:00] <brmbrmcar> Is it a major change?
[2015/11/25 10:50:12] <grumbel> no, just removal of dead code
[2015/11/25 10:50:36] <brmbrmcar> OK, then. Fine.
[2015/11/25 10:50:53] <brmbrmcar> Probably won't be needed now.
[2015/11/25 10:58:40] <grumbel> All the addons that use custom tilesets just define a new one right now instead of mixing them inside the .stl
[2015/11/25 10:59:19] <grumbel> and the editor doesn't support it either of course

[2015/11/25 12:47:49] <Hume2> Hello Tobbi. Could you describe me what you think I've done recently?
[2015/11/25 12:48:05] <Tobbi> Hume2: I don't know. I believe it was a mistake on my part.
[2015/11/25 12:48:29] <Hume2> Tobbi: see https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commit/1f616741767b08e5c2db876f9484b327fcfd4cd9#diff-900335f1aa051f8b032208aa4a763c18L432
[2015/11/25 12:48:55] <Hume2> Tobbi: This is the code I've replaced with some more effective stuff.
[2015/11/25 12:48:57] <Tobbi> Hume2: Some tiles might need to have the COIN setting or something.
[2015/11/25 12:49:18] <Tobbi> I|m talking about // Marked for removal. Don't use
[2015/11/25 12:50:27] <Hume2> Tobbi: The COIN attribute is done another way.
[2015/11/25 12:50:34] <Tobbi> Sure?
[2015/11/25 12:50:37] <Tobbi> What about the others?

[2015/11/25 12:54:32] <Tobbi> I see?
[2015/11/25 12:55:07] <Hume2> Tobbi: In the case ob Brick, there was just a list of IDs which sprite is for which tiles.
[2015/11/25 12:55:14] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/25 12:55:41] <Hume2> Tobbi: All blocks with coin #t had the default con sprite.
[2015/11/25 12:55:55] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yes. but I am willing to change that.
[2015/11/25 12:56:02] <Tobbi> Aka, have the blue coin sprite for other levels...
[2015/11/25 12:56:12] <Tobbi> For the Yeti's Revenge levels.
[2015/11/25 12:56:23] <Hume2> Tobbi: Was this even possible?
[2015/11/25 12:56:31] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yes it worked the one time I tried.
[2015/11/25 12:56:41] <Hume2> I'll take a look on it's tileset.
[2015/11/25 12:57:09] <Hume2> I think it must be a powerup, but I'll take a look anyway.
[2015/11/25 12:58:19] <Hume2> Tobbi: Yet's Revenge doesn't use any custom tileset.
[2015/11/25 12:58:45] <Tobbi> Hume2: As long as I can still set (coin #t) on some object, I am fine.
[2015/11/25 12:59:24] <Hume2> Tobbi: What are you speaking about? (coin #t) on tiles?
[2015/11/25 12:59:31] <Hume2> ...or on objects?
[2015/11/25 12:59:34] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yeah, not sure...
[2015/11/25 12:59:39] <Tobbi> Not sure how I managed it last time.
[2015/11/25 13:01:33] <Hume2> Tobbi: I don't know any object with a "coin" boolean.
[2015/11/25 13:01:58] <Hume2> Tobbi: And when you apply it on a tile, it becomes the normal yellow coin.
[2015/11/25 13:02:22] <Hume2> That's the previous behaviour.
[2015/11/25 13:07:58] <Hume2> Tobbi: Blue coins work by the way.

[2015/11/25 13:17:49] <Tobbi> Hume2: I know that they work. But they don't show the coin animation...
[2015/11/25 13:17:53] <Tobbi> when you collect them.
[2015/11/25 13:18:02] <Hume2> hmmm...
[2015/11/25 13:18:03] <Tobbi> Thus, setting coin to #t, then setting a sprite file should work...
[2015/11/25 13:18:51] <Hume2> Tobbi: It's a powerup and I didn't affected powerups.
[2015/11/25 13:19:06] <Tobbi> Hume2: The coins are custom objects.

[2015/11/25 14:15:48] <head8debian> "I am concerned about poultry and animals being given growth hormones". Arg... We don't give them growth hormones! We would be put out of buisiness if we did, but people don't realize that.
[2015/11/25 14:22:21] <head8debian> Also, the only reason we would(if ever) give them antibiotics is if they are not feeling well. Its illegal for us to sell animals with these antibiotics in their systems for up to 60 days after the last dose was given.
[2015/11/25 14:22:44] <head8debian> If any antibiotics are found in the meat the meat gets dumped and we get put out of buisiness, pretty much.

[2015/11/25 17:21:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: For a electrical fixture to be legally put up over here they have to meet some pretty strict quality standards.
[2015/11/25 17:22:00] <Tobbi> really?

[2015/11/26 08:36:14] <head8deb1an> mt: That also. As i quote "CE is useless without any actual supervision and quality control"
[2015/11/26 08:36:34] <head8deb1an> mt: Its so over-used that you don't know whats safe or not.
[2015/11/26 08:38:18] <mt> if you'd continue the lines of the C and E both should finish up in a circle, some companies with unauthorized CE marks make the mistake to forget that ;)

[2015/11/26 09:19:18] <grumbel> Tobbi: It's all build ontop of the other sexp and memorycleanup branch, might be possible to transfer it, but not really worth it

[2015/11/26 12:27:50] <Tobbi> mt: Come on, why are you nitpicking?
[2015/11/26 12:28:02] <Tobbi> You're almost as bad as that other nitpicker I kind of remember.
[2015/11/26 12:28:10] <Tobbi> very very vaguely...
[2015/11/26 12:29:15] <mt> ok, I'll stop *hides*
[2015/11/26 12:29:37] * brmbrmcar is getting confused...
[2015/11/26 12:31:58] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You have always been confused... There's no "getting confused" for you.
[2015/11/26 12:32:27] <brmbrmcar> I will fix the finishworldmap() command...
[2015/11/26 12:33:21] <brmbrmcar> Ah, it isn't called that.
[2015/11/26 12:34:10] <brmbrmcar> But the real one doesn't work!
[2015/11/26 12:35:55] <Tobbi> head8arch: I just tweeted a call-out to potential translators.
[2015/11/26 12:36:10] <Tobbi> Not sure if many read it, though.
[2015/11/26 12:39:07] <Tobbi> By the way: Do we follow people back that follow us? Might seem nice.
[2015/11/26 12:42:20] <mt> you might also want to follow the fsf/gnu accounts, github, transifex (if they have twitter)
[2015/11/26 12:43:05] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/11/26 12:48:13] <mt> So how can I review translations in transifex
[2015/11/26 12:49:30] <leper`> you need to be reviewer or coordinator or project owner (or something like that)
[2015/11/26 12:49:40] <leper`> then you have a review button in the webinterface
[2015/11/26 12:49:54] <mt> also, regarding the requestion languages: what's your opinion on adding en_AU and de_AT? seems pretty useless
[2015/11/26 12:50:03] <Tobbi> mt: I don't know if I've been given you the necessary rights, yet. But if you ask one of the admins nicely, then I am sure something can be arranged :P

[2015/11/26 12:51:31] <leper`> (to add to the country specific thing: We (0ad in case nobody saw the above link) don't add those for the most part (unless the languages actually differ enough), and we also do not add lang_FOO but lang normally)
[2015/11/26 12:51:48] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/26 12:53:39] <leper`> (which helps since we have some code for falling back to eg en in case en_AU is the system/user locale and en_AU does not exist)

[2015/11/26 13:33:52] <grumbel> Same problem with the darktrap, load() changes the state
[2015/11/26 13:38:23] <Hume2> grumbel: There's another thing. It's called again in the next update...
[2015/11/26 13:39:48] <grumbel> just revert both commits
[2015/11/26 13:40:45] <Hume2> grumbel: It works the same way as before. Do you know why?
[2015/11/26 13:40:57] <Hume2> I got why.
[2015/11/26 13:41:06] <Hume2> And it works. I tested it.
[2015/11/26 13:42:56] <grumbel> It does something different then before and is now a frame late
[2015/11/26 13:43:17] <grumbel> I have no idea if it matters, it just the type of bug that I prefer to not have to deal with

[2015/11/26 13:43:29] <grumbel> thus it's better to not introduce them in the first place
[2015/11/26 13:43:43] <Hume2> grumbel: Yes, but all the other states begin on time check.
[2015/11/26 13:44:04] <Hume2> And we can expect that the timer is much longer than one frame.

[2015/11/26 14:51:56] <brmbrmcar> I queried red_bot once and tried to figlet the full chemical name of titin.
[2015/11/26 14:52:08] @ leyyin joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/26 14:52:09] <brmbrmcar> It just threw up an error.
[2015/11/26 14:52:12] <Karkus> I did the same except with lorum ipsum
[2015/11/26 14:52:21] <Tobbi> *lorem
[2015/11/26 14:52:33] <leper`> et si dolor
[2015/11/26 14:52:38] <brmbrmcar> I don't get lorem ipsum.
[2015/11/26 14:52:38] <Karkus> Meant that :D
[2015/11/26 14:52:45] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: And you never will.
[2015/11/26 14:52:47] <Karkus> https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=lorum+ipsum
[2015/11/26 14:52:53] <Tobbi> It's latin. Naturally you don't get it.
[2015/11/26 14:53:06] <Karkus> It's not proper Latin though
[2015/11/26 14:53:07] <brmbrmcar> I don't see the point.
[2015/11/26 14:53:22] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Visual deficiency as well, now?
[2015/11/26 14:53:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: I thought it was...
[2015/11/26 14:53:31] <brmbrmcar> You could just type in anything you want.
[2015/11/26 14:53:43] <Hume2> I don't understand latin.
[2015/11/26 14:53:56] <Tobbi> Oh, no, it is not...
[2015/11/26 14:54:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: "The lorem ipsum text is typically a scrambled section of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC Latin text by Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin."
[2015/11/26 14:54:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yup, the German wikipedia told me kind of the same, anyway.
[2015/11/26 14:54:43] @ Drangue joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/26 14:54:44] <brmbrmcar> I have never used lorem isum.
[2015/11/26 14:54:55] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: No wonder, it's called lorem ipsum.
[2015/11/26 14:55:04] @ Quit: alket: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2015/11/26 14:55:43] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: That was a typo!
[2015/11/26 14:55:54] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: No, that was a reply to your typo.
[2015/11/26 14:56:02] <Tobbi> And that was some person quitting due to ping timeout.
[2015/11/26 14:56:02] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/26 14:56:22] <brmbrmcar> Any way of hanging Tux's sprite in a level?
[2015/11/26 14:56:32] <Tobbi> I should write my ph.D. on how to properly annoy immature-acting individuals.
[2015/11/26 14:56:37] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: It's filler text. Its purpose is to mean nothing while still displaying the features of the thing...
[2015/11/26 14:56:44] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Decals
[2015/11/26 14:57:01] <brmbrmcar> So why not write in This is a filler text!
[2015/11/26 14:57:22] <Karkus> Because that would be far too easy for simple people to understand/
[2015/11/26 14:57:24] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Because people who have OCD get so drawn to reading this, than a non-sensical text.
[2015/11/26 14:57:25] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/26 14:57:26] <leper`> Tobbi: just so you can write phallus Dickus next to your name when signing things
[2015/11/26 14:57:36] <Tobbi> leper`: *Biggus dickus.
[2015/11/26 14:57:49] <leper`> but that doesn't fit the abbreviation
[2015/11/26 14:57:53] <Tobbi> Oh, right.
[2015/11/26 14:58:25] <leper`> (and yes there's a pun hidden there)
[2015/11/26 14:58:59] <Tobbi> whatever...
[2015/11/26 14:59:30] <leper`> well you wanted to write about being a dick on the internet
[2015/11/26 15:00:16] <Tobbi> ah
[2015/11/26 15:00:17] <Tobbi> hah.

[2015/11/26 15:03:04] <Hume2> It's cool.

[2015/11/26 15:03:30] <Tobbi> Why can't he change his quit message to something sane?
[2015/11/26 15:03:48] <leper`> /quite something sane
[2015/11/26 15:03:54] <leper`> /quit something sane
[2015/11/26 15:03:56] <leper`> dang
[2015/11/26 15:03:59] @ Quit: Karkus: Quit: Leaving
[2015/11/26 15:04:07] <Tobbi> Yeah, for example that ^
[2015/11/26 15:04:10] <Tobbi> Leaving!
[2015/11/26 15:04:13] <Tobbi> That sounds sane.
[2015/11/26 15:04:35] <leper`> "Living" would be another one

[2015/11/26 15:18:46] <Tobbi> Just translating...
[2015/11/26 15:18:56] <Karkus> Did I miss something?
[2015/11/26 15:19:11] <Tobbi> Karkus: In the literal sense? Nothing much.
[2015/11/26 15:19:40] <Karkus> So what are you translating from?
[2015/11/26 15:19:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: A video...
[2015/11/26 15:20:30] <Karkus> Oh, okay :D Google translate captions are great, too
[2015/11/26 15:21:00] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2015/11/26 15:21:03] <Tobbi> let me see...

[2015/11/26 15:21:53] <Tobbi> That's a difference.
[2015/11/26 15:21:54] <brmbrmcar> How do you even set a quit message? I have to do it manually!
[2015/11/26 15:22:39] <Karkus> If you think really hard about it for long enough, it will change. Other than that, yes, you must do it manually
[2015/11/26 15:22:58] <brmbrmcar>  /set quitMessage quit?
[2015/11/26 15:23:07] <brmbrmcar> Absolutely crazy.
[2015/11/26 15:24:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: tele-quit-nesis?
[2015/11/26 15:24:43] <Karkus> Yep
[2015/11/26 15:24:56] <brmbrmcar> I set it!
[2015/11/26 15:25:11] <Karkus> Well done
[2015/11/26 15:25:19] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Okay, now. Try it out.
[2015/11/26 15:25:22] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/11/26 15:26:41] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You didn't quit hard enough.
[2015/11/26 15:26:51] <Karkus> It worked great!
[2015/11/26 15:26:53] <brmbrmcar> Well, I set it.
[2015/11/26 15:26:53] <Tobbi> Break your router, maybe it'll work the.
[2015/11/26 15:26:55] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/11/26 15:26:57] <Hume2> The quit message was "brmbrmquit".
[2015/11/26 15:27:01] <Karkus> What did you change it to again?
[2015/11/26 15:27:05] <brmbrmcar> Inyellow?
[2015/11/26 15:27:32] <Hume2> I saw "brmbrmquit".
[2015/11/26 15:27:37] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/26 15:28:03] <Karkus> sudo rm -rf / #<quit message>
[2015/11/26 15:28:10] <brmbrmcar> No!
[2015/11/26 15:28:30] <brmbrmcar> I removed the password requirement!
[2015/11/26 15:28:38] <Karkus> Wow
[2015/11/26 15:28:51] <brmbrmcar> sudo visudo
[2015/11/26 15:28:57] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Why would you do that?
[2015/11/26 15:28:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: I can tell that this worked.
[2015/11/26 15:29:09] <Tobbi> I mean: brmbrmcar: I can tell that Karkus' advice worked.
[2015/11/26 15:29:17] <brmbrmcar> Because I'm very lazy.
[2015/11/26 15:29:39] <brmbrmcar> sudo rm -rf won't actually delete everything.
[2015/11/26 15:29:56] <Tobbi> Oh, maybe format...something.
[2015/11/26 15:30:01] <brmbrmcar> Only if you get to root.
[2015/11/26 15:30:34] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: What if you do sudo rm -rf / by accident?
[2015/11/26 15:30:34] <Karkus> like, when changing your quit message
[2015/11/26 15:31:04] <brmbrmcar> Lets see if running commands actually works from irssi?
[2015/11/26 15:31:20] <brmbrmcar> sudo arduino
[2015/11/26 15:31:24] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: But, will it remove your IRC client?
[2015/11/26 15:31:33] <brmbrmcar> I'll take that as a no.
[2015/11/26 15:31:38] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: No.
[2015/11/26 15:31:43] <brmbrmcar> sudo rm -rf
[2015/11/26 15:31:49] <brmbrmcar> See.
[2015/11/26 15:32:00] <Hume2> Um...
[2015/11/26 15:32:11] <Hume2> Does it do anything?
[2015/11/26 15:32:17] <brmbrmcar> Nope.
[2015/11/26 15:32:24] <Hume2> That's good.
[2015/11/26 15:32:49] <brmbrmcar> Otherwise it would be like Unknown command! Unknown command!
[2015/11/26 15:32:56] <Karkus> [sudo] password for brmbrmcar:
[2015/11/26 15:33:13] <brmbrmcar> Not telling  you the password...
[2015/11/26 15:33:20] <Tobbi> I suppose it's brmbrmcar.
[2015/11/26 15:33:24] <Tobbi> or brmbrmpassword
[2015/11/26 15:33:28] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/26 15:33:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: Haha
[2015/11/26 15:33:32] <brmbrmcar> Because you are on s different computer
[2015/11/26 15:33:42] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: What about ssh?
[2015/11/26 15:33:58] <brmbrmcar> Nah. Not through irssi.
[2015/11/26 15:34:04] <Karkus> I am secretly a super anonymous hacker
[2015/11/26 15:34:31] <Hume2> Karkus: Can we analyze angrystone.cpp?
[2015/11/26 15:34:46] <brmbrmcar> Invert my GitHub profile picture then, hacker.
[2015/11/26 15:34:48] <Karkus> Hume2: Analyse? Why?
[2015/11/26 15:35:24] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Challenge accepted.
[2015/11/26 15:35:25] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/26 15:35:42] <brmbrmcar> OK, then.
[2015/11/26 15:35:43] <Hume2> Karkus: There's some kind of "bug" about that I want to know more.
[2015/11/26 15:35:49] <brmbrmcar> 5 minutes left.
[2015/11/26 15:35:51] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Solution: turn your computer upside down
[2015/11/26 15:36:07] <Hume2> Karkus: Angrystone::active_update
[2015/11/26 15:36:20] <brmbrmcar> I ean horizontally!
[2015/11/26 15:36:29] <brmbrmcar> Or whichever way that is!
[2015/11/26 15:36:57] <Hume2> Karkus: I changed there something and I want to know whether it's better or worse.
[2015/11/26 15:37:18] <Karkus> So, you want me to test it?
[2015/11/26 15:37:33] <Hume2> Karkus: No, see the code please.
[2015/11/26 15:37:36] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: http://imgur.com/h6PPmOi
[2015/11/26 15:37:51] <Karkus> Hume2: Right. Which commit?
[2015/11/26 15:38:14] <Hume2> Karkus: The last two commits.
[2015/11/26 15:38:23] <Karkus> Okay
[2015/11/26 15:38:39] <Hume2> Karkus: As you can see, I changed the bunch of if's to a switch.
[2015/11/26 15:38:59] <Karkus> You did.
[2015/11/26 15:39:14] <Hume2> Karkus: There's a problem that the state can be changed inside the switch.
[2015/11/26 15:39:46] <Hume2> Karkus: As it was before, it went to the other state's if exception, but now it skips it.
[2015/11/26 15:40:19] <Karkus> Of course, that's how switches work...
[2015/11/26 15:40:29] <Hume2> Karkus: However, there's something that causes that it behaves exacly the same.
[2015/11/26 15:40:51] <Karkus> I don't understand?
[2015/11/26 15:41:03] <Karkus> You mean, it shouldn't work but it does?
[2015/11/26 15:41:22] <Hume2> Karkus: No, I mean that it worked before the same as it does now.
[2015/11/26 15:41:49] <Hume2> Karkus: As you can see, there's a nested exception in each case.
[2015/11/26 15:42:43] <Hume2> Karkus: Do you see it?
[2015/11/26 15:44:11] <brmbrmcar> tobbi: Awesome!
[2015/11/26 15:44:19] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: And now stop.

[2015/11/27 10:39:23] <Tobbi> giby: Are you there?
[2015/11/27 10:40:30] <head8debian> Hello Tobbi.
[2015/11/27 10:40:46] <Tobbi> hello head8debian
[2015/11/27 10:42:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: So, here is a question. I want to start doing screencasts for computer-related things, but what should i do?
[2015/11/27 10:42:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh?
[2015/11/27 10:42:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: Make a beautiful supertux 0.4.0 video...
[2015/11/27 10:42:44] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/27 10:42:48] <giby> Hi Tobbi
[2015/11/27 10:42:56] <brmbrmcar> Install screencasting software.
[2015/11/27 10:43:10] <Tobbi> giby: So, when you download po files, how are they arranged? Assuming I want to create a script that packages these into add-ons.
[2015/11/27 10:43:10] <brmbrmcar> I assume you can get it to work...
[2015/11/27 10:43:23] <Tobbi> giby: I am talking about the tx client.
[2015/11/27 10:43:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: The issue with that is that my GPU cannot keep up when running a screen recorder and SUpertux.
[2015/11/27 10:43:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: Well, then, you're doomed.
[2015/11/27 10:43:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: Doomed? ;D
[2015/11/27 10:44:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: yes.
[2015/11/27 10:44:02] <brmbrmcar> Find a way around it.
[2015/11/27 10:44:20] <giby> Tobbi, ... well first I unzip the add ons, put the po files in each folders, then repack, get md5sum and push
[2015/11/27 10:44:31] <brmbrmcar> Like one of those programs they use to spy on you.
[2015/11/27 10:44:59] <Tobbi> giby: So, you do this manually... When you download them, what do you download? I want to create a script that automates creating langpacks...
[2015/11/27 10:45:21] <Tobbi> I assume you keep getting po files that I also get when I download manually...
[2015/11/27 10:45:34] <Tobbi> Are the po files all in one folder?
[2015/11/27 10:45:50] <Tobbi> I just need information on the folder structure of the stuff you download.
[2015/11/27 10:46:25] <giby> I use the client
[2015/11/27 10:47:12] <Tobbi> giby: Okay, what do you get then? one po file per language per add-on?
[2015/11/27 10:47:18] <Tobbi> in one folder?

[2015/11/28 08:26:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: Cool.
[2015/11/28 08:26:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: How far are you guessing that you are on it?
[2015/11/28 08:27:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: It can create zip files and create an nfo file to be appended to the repo index.
[2015/11/28 08:27:31] <Tobbi> So, that's done.
[2015/11/28 08:27:37] <Tobbi> Not sure what else is needed, though.
[2015/11/28 08:27:55] <Tobbi> It also might only work on OSX...
[2015/11/28 08:28:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: o_O
[2015/11/28 08:29:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: When you do md5 <file path>, does it give you the file path in that case?
[2015/11/28 08:29:57] <Tobbi> Sorry, I meant md5 -q <file path>
[2015/11/28 08:30:39] <head8debian> Hmm, let me try it on a random file.
[2015/11/28 08:30:49] <Tobbi> head8debian: I meant the md5 of that thing.
[2015/11/28 08:30:59] <Tobbi> md5 -q <file path> should give you the md5 of course.
[2015/11/28 08:32:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: There is no md5, only md5sum.
[2015/11/28 08:32:59] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/11/28 08:33:03] <head8debian> And there is no -q perameter for it.
[2015/11/28 08:33:04] <mt> can we switch to something more future-proof than md5, like BLAKE2, or at least SHA-2
[2015/11/28 08:33:22] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, there's the problem with mac vs. linux.
[2015/11/28 08:33:29] <head8debian> There is --quiet, not -q...
[2015/11/28 08:35:06] <mt> it's a bsd vs gnu difference, not something apple or linux specific
[2015/11/28 08:36:02] <Tobbi> I see.
[2015/11/28 08:36:14] <Tobbi> mt: So, how do I get an md5 that likely works on all platforms?
[2015/11/28 08:37:47] <mt> you write one in python, perl or ruby
[2015/11/28 08:37:58] <Tobbi> Hmm, that might work...
[2015/11/28 08:39:17] <mt> or, if openssl/libressl works, `openssl dgst -md5 -hex /path/to/file`
[2015/11/28 08:40:21] <mt> md5 in that command can be replaced with sha256, sha384, sha512, whirlpool and some others I don't want to mention because they're also outdated
[2015/11/28 08:40:50] <Tobbi> Yes, unfortunately we currently depend on MD5...and we should keep it that way until after 0.4.0...
[2015/11/28 08:40:55] <Tobbi> Otherwise people will complain.
[2015/11/28 08:42:47] <mt> one might argue: "but it's just downloading an addon file", well the actual problem: the zips could be modified to work like a zip-bomb (and that's the reason why one doesn't simply extract any archive without verification)
[2015/11/28 08:44:16] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/28 08:49:52] <Tobbi> So, I just added language packs that I created.
[2015/11/28 08:52:36] <Tobbi> Yay! Okay, I wrecked it :D

[2015/11/28 09:00:20] <Tobbi> This will wreck downloading add-ons for everyone who doesn't have the latest version.
[2015/11/28 09:00:21] <Tobbi> But who cares

[2015/11/28 09:03:00] <Tobbi> Currently you have to go through all these languages in the add-on manager and get your language pack.
[2015/11/28 09:05:44] <Tobbi> Actually, before I wreck it for everyone, I might want to exclude the _ add-ons from the repo index.
[2015/11/28 09:09:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: If I only showed the language pack for the selected language, would that work?

[2015/11/28 14:34:59] <head8debian> In a min.\
[2015/11/28 14:36:22] <Tobbi> head8debian: Also, start with --debug
[2015/11/28 14:36:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: Odd, when i run --debug the music starts quite a bit before the game appears.
[2015/11/28 14:36:32] <Tobbi> Oh, I already told you that :D
[2015/11/28 14:36:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: Latest master?
[2015/11/28 14:36:48] <Tobbi> *sigh* not odd at all...
[2015/11/28 14:37:11] <head8debian> Yes, latest master.
[2015/11/28 14:37:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, instaleld german. Now what?
[2015/11/28 14:37:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am downloading language packs...or checking for language packs...
[2015/11/28 14:37:30] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/11/28 14:37:32] <Tobbi> Seems like this might not be the best way to do it, then.
[2015/11/28 14:37:34] <head8debian> You have quite a list.
[2015/11/28 14:37:47] <Tobbi> Your internet connection is small, I assume.
[2015/11/28 14:37:51] <Tobbi> eeh slow

[2015/11/28 14:40:29] <Tobbi> head8debian: No...I don't know what we could do.
[2015/11/28 14:40:38] <Tobbi> Unless we start the process after the game has started...
[2015/11/28 14:40:43] <Tobbi> We could look into that.
[2015/11/28 14:41:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: WHAT Proccess?
[2015/11/28 14:41:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: The download process...
[2015/11/28 14:41:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot follow when you talk half to yourself. :)
[2015/11/28 14:41:57] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/11/28 14:42:05] <head8debian> When is it starting now?
[2015/11/28 14:42:10] <head8debian> Oh, i see...
[2015/11/28 14:42:22] <head8debian> Hmm.
[2015/11/28 14:42:36] <head8debian> I'd prefer the download to be triggered manually, personally.
[2015/11/28 14:42:55] <head8debian> Otherwise supertux has because windows. Downloading things without your knowledge.
[2015/11/28 14:43:19] <head8debian> ;)
[2015/11/28 14:43:32] <mt> after the game has started/in parallel to loading would require working reload capability
[2015/11/28 14:44:28] <mt> head8debian: we could do it like supertuxkart, ask for permission to access network functions on the first start
[2015/11/28 14:44:58] <head8debian> Exactly...
[2015/11/28 14:45:30] <mt> but I guess that won't happen in 0.4.x because string freeze
[2015/11/28 14:45:35] <head8debian> The few people on dialup will think that supertux doesn't work because of slow startup.
[2015/11/28 14:46:35] <Tobbi> mt: Yeah, I will possibly revert my attempt to load it at startup. If you have a better idea, go right ahead.

[2015/11/29 11:04:57] * Tobbi punches head8debian back.
[2015/11/29 11:05:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: My lights aren't even on.
[2015/11/29 11:05:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: Nm... :D
[2015/11/29 11:05:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, what about that script that I wanted which fixes lang strings?
[2015/11/29 11:06:04] <Tobbi> Do you have it ready? :D
[2015/11/29 11:06:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: You wanted one?
[2015/11/29 11:06:24] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yes, of course. I couldn't do it, so I guessed, you might be the right person, with your programming skills and everything.
[2015/11/29 11:07:03] * head8debian blinks...
[2015/11/29 11:07:18] * head8debian wonders if Tobbi has me confused with someone else...
[2015/11/29 11:07:22] <Tobbi> leyyin: You worked at Google, thus you know everything... How do I prevent xtinygettext from altering my source file strings (it removes "\" from the source file strings)
[2015/11/29 11:07:43] <Tobbi> head8debian: I wonder if I have confused myself with someone else, sometimes.
[2015/11/29 11:08:31] <leyyin> Tobbi, xgettext?
[2015/11/29 11:08:42] <Tobbi> leyyin: xgettext = extraction from source files...
[2015/11/29 11:08:50] <leyyin> yes :D
[2015/11/29 11:08:52] <leyyin> I know that
[2015/11/29 11:08:52] <Tobbi> aka, string extraction...
[2015/11/29 11:08:58] <leyyin> I only worked with that
[2015/11/29 11:09:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: I have \n in scripts...it removes that during parsing.
[2015/11/29 11:09:11] <Tobbi> Any way to prevent that?
[2015/11/29 11:09:24] <leyyin> is xtinygettext different?
[2015/11/29 11:09:40] <Tobbi> leyyin: I meant xgettext
[2015/11/29 11:09:43] <Tobbi> I am confused.
[2015/11/29 11:09:46] <Tobbi> But you know that
[2015/11/29 11:09:57] <Tobbi> And sometimes I am a fanatic lychee.
[2015/11/29 11:10:03] <Tobbi> Oh god, I sound like brmbrmcar
[2015/11/29 11:10:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, i code the script and you replace a head gasket? :D Only be $300 + 20 hours of time.
[2015/11/29 11:10:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: If you pay for that, sure... I mean: Pay for limo, plus flight plus limo to your home, plus my time...
[2015/11/29 11:10:46] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/29 11:10:56] <Tobbi> plus, restaurant, hotel etc.
[2015/11/29 11:11:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: You eat cow feed! :D
[2015/11/29 11:11:07] <leyyin> Tobbi, xgettext should not modify source files...
[2015/11/29 11:11:12] <leyyin> as far as I know
[2015/11/29 11:11:15] <head8debian> And sleep in the barn. :D
[2015/11/29 11:11:27] <Tobbi> leyyin: It doesn't modify the source files, but it omits the backslash while parsing,
[2015/11/29 11:11:31] <Tobbi> I checked.
[2015/11/29 11:12:28] <leyyin> weird
[2015/11/29 11:13:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: Indeed. I know that normally line breaks are written some other way in gettext files, but the source string is like this "This is some text\ninmultiplelines" so it needs to be that exact way...
[2015/11/29 11:13:40] <Tobbi> I could fix the strings with some other python script, but I'd rather avoid doing this magic.
[2015/11/29 11:14:36] <leyyin> Tobbi, Each of untranslated-string and translated-string respects the C syntax for a character string, including the surrounding quotes and embedded backslashed escape sequences. When the time comes to write multi-line strings, one should not use escaped newlines. Instead, a closing quote should follow the last character on the line to be continued, and an opening quote should resume the string at the beginning of the following PO file line.
[2015/11/29 11:14:38] <leyyin> rtfm
[2015/11/29 11:15:07] <Tobbi> leyyin: I could do that, but it wouldn't find the source string then...
[2015/11/29 11:15:15] <Tobbi> The source string is like that with the escaped \n.
[2015/11/29 11:15:18] <Tobbi> ffs.
[2015/11/29 11:15:34] <leyyin> did you read above?
[2015/11/29 11:15:35] <leyyin> "Instead, a closing quote should follow the last character on the line to be continued, and an opening quote should resume the string at the beginning of the following PO file line."
[2015/11/29 11:15:44] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, it'll find that?
[2015/11/29 11:15:48] <Tobbi> I'll try...one moment.
[2015/11/29 11:15:51] <leyyin> yes...

[2015/11/29 11:16:40] <Tobbi> leyyin: But, be proud of me: I did my first few steps in bash programming and succeeded, somewhat
[2015/11/29 11:16:41] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/29 11:17:22] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/29 11:17:28] <leyyin> bash sucks anyways
[2015/11/29 11:17:36] <leyyin> bash syntax even more
[2015/11/29 11:17:49] <Tobbi> leyyin: I know...but makepot.sh was written in bash.
[2015/11/29 11:18:03] <leyyin> it's fine, if the script is under 100 lines :P
[2015/11/29 11:18:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: the important stuff is done in python anyway...
[2015/11/29 11:18:31] <Tobbi> As in: Fetching the source strings to translate and getting them in a format that xgettext can understand.
[2015/11/29 11:20:04] <leyyin> and for your shell you should use zsh or better, fish :P
[2015/11/29 11:20:30] <Tobbi> leyyin: I don't care about the bash script anyway...I should probably reprogram ./makepot.sh to use python instead.
[2015/11/29 11:25:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: Okay, it worked. I will try to split the string then...
[2015/11/29 11:30:56] <leyyin> see, if you read the manual you win ;)
[2015/11/29 11:38:01] <Tobbi> leyyin: By asking you, one might win as well :D
[2015/11/29 11:38:08] <Tobbi> Since you are basically google, you know everything :D
[2015/11/29 11:38:18] <leyyin> right....
[2015/11/29 11:38:39] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/29 11:47:13] <Hume2> Transifex is very working :D
[2015/11/29 11:50:30] <Tobbi> Hume2: It's working?
[2015/11/29 12:00:22] <Tobbi> Atom is actually quite a nice text editor.

[2015/11/29 12:27:54] <leyyin> do not call len() every freaking time on the list
[2015/11/29 12:28:01] <leyyin> it's time consuming

[2015/11/29 12:29:13] <leyyin> wait, it's python

[2015/11/29 16:33:43] <Tobbi> I figured we might want to add those...
[2015/11/29 16:33:46] <Tobbi> Before the release, I mean.
[2015/11/29 16:34:08] <giby> Ok

[2015/11/29 16:34:49] <Tobbi> If not, I might need to do some changes.
[2015/11/29 16:35:03] <giby> I'll check
[2015/11/29 16:35:11] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/29 16:35:20] <Tobbi> And do reset the generated files afterwards
[2015/11/29 16:35:33] <Tobbi> They are generated inside the translations/ subdirectory now.

[2015/11/30 11:40:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: I managed to get the intro talk between penny and tux on transifex.
[2015/11/30 11:40:14] <Tobbi> Now it only needs to be translated.
[2015/11/30 11:40:55] <Tobbi> Also, release in just...3 (?) weeks?
[2015/11/30 11:41:02] <Tobbi> Less than, even.
[2015/11/30 11:41:13] <Tobbi> We set the 20th, didn't we?
[2015/11/30 11:41:48] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/30 11:41:53] <brmbrmcar> 20 days.
[2015/11/30 11:42:50] <Karkus> Well, it depends whether you want a test build now to ensure everything works... e.g. test windows and installer.
[2015/11/30 11:43:04] <Karkus> by 'now' I mean soon
[2015/11/30 11:43:06] <head8debian> It would probably be a good idea.
[2015/11/30 11:43:27] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/30 11:44:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: I did you a favour and removed langpack update checking at startup.
[2015/11/30 11:44:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/30 11:46:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, let's get a test build out in a week? Hoping that maths22 is ready...
[2015/11/30 11:47:05] <Tobbi> We should integrate l10n from transifex before, though.
[2015/11/30 11:47:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: Sounds like a plan
[2015/11/30 11:48:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: Also, check out this *beautiful* python script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SuperTux/supertux/master/extract_strings.py It's so beautiful that the beauty it radiates makes everything around it even more beautiful.
[2015/11/30 11:49:57] <brmbrmcar> I like it.
[2015/11/30 11:50:07] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/30 11:50:07] <brmbrmcar> Easy enough to understand.
[2015/11/30 11:50:12] <Tobbi> I am merely messing with you guys.
[2015/11/30 11:50:13] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/30 11:50:23] <Tobbi> Because it's just a python script.
[2015/11/30 11:50:46] <brmbrmcar> Iwish Arduino was Python...
[2015/11/30 11:51:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: Nothing special about it?
[2015/11/30 11:51:44] <Tobbi> Karkus: Just that I had to write it because xgettext wouldn't appreciate "\n" inside the source strings.
[2015/11/30 11:52:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: The scripts fetches translate tags from squirrel files and writes them to a lisp file.
[2015/11/30 11:52:19] <Tobbi> Which xgettext can fetch.
[2015/11/30 11:52:49] <Karkus> Okay :)
[2015/11/30 11:53:20] <brmbrmcar> xgettext?
[2015/11/30 11:53:52] <Tobbi> ...extracts translatable strings fro source files.
[2015/11/30 11:53:57] <Tobbi> *from
[2015/11/30 11:54:38] <brmbrmcar> Oooh.

[2015/11/30 11:59:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: Is that level even in the worldmap?
[2015/11/30 11:59:24] <Hume2> Tobbi: No, it isn't.
[2015/11/30 12:02:18] <brmbrmcar> Nice level.
[2015/11/30 12:02:25] <Tobbi> nice eyes...
[2015/11/30 12:02:29] <Tobbi> nice ice
[2015/11/30 12:02:36] <Tobbi> We should add a couple levels to incubator...
[2015/11/30 12:03:08] <brmbrmcar> Like what?
[2015/11/30 12:03:34] <Tobbi> There are some levels that didn't make it into Bonus Island 3.
[2015/11/30 12:04:07] <Hume2> Any idea why they aren't there?
[2015/11/30 12:05:04] <Tobbi> Hume2: I talked to LMH and he removed some of them...
[2015/11/30 12:05:12] <Tobbi> Hume2: But the latest worldmap is here: http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=915
[2015/11/30 12:05:41] <Tobbi> Can you go through them, and see which ones aren't in Bonus Island 3 and add these to Incubator...?
[2015/11/30 12:06:28] <Hume2> Tobbi: will do
[2015/11/30 12:06:44] <Tobbi> Actually, LMH claims the add-ons repo contains an updated version, not sure if that's true.
[2015/11/30 12:08:25] <Hume2> Tobbi: It's true, the .zip is there, but the sorve in /src is missing.
[2015/11/30 12:08:28] <brmbrmcar> There was  variant of Bonus Island 3 in 0.3.4 and previous.
[2015/11/30 12:08:40] <Tobbi> Hume2: Link to the zip.
[2015/11/30 12:08:42] <Tobbi> please.

[2015/12/01 09:48:13] <jesusalva> 'Atarctica' is annoying to translate. Half translated as 'antartiDa', half as 'antartiCa'. And the most annoying part? Both are correct. :/

[2015/12/01 10:45:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why?
[2015/12/01 10:45:39] <brmbrmcar> Christmas music is just a way to get a bkt of fast profit.
[2015/12/01 10:46:15] <brmbrmcar> All the other businesses selling stuff benefit, and music wants to join.
[2015/12/01 10:46:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't know, im just over annoyed by it this year.

[2015/12/01 10:51:19] <Tobbi> one line each.
[2015/12/01 10:52:12] <brmbrmcar> I have a song.
[2015/12/01 10:52:18] <brmbrmcar> For Christmas.
[2015/12/01 10:52:25] <brmbrmcar> Well, thew lyrics.
[2015/12/01 10:52:29] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I said "I" not, you.
[2015/12/01 10:52:41] <Tobbi> oh, those weren't lyrics.
[2015/12/01 10:53:15] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2015/12/01 10:54:55] <brmbrmcar> All these other songs over-axaggarate Christmas.
[2015/12/01 10:55:43] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: axe...
[2015/12/01 10:55:50] <Tobbi> fits to xmas perfectly...
[2015/12/01 10:55:52] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/01 10:56:03] <brmbrmcar> I meant exaggerate.
[2015/12/01 10:56:20] <brmbrmcar> And I don't like "xmas".
[2015/12/01 10:56:27] <brmbrmcar> It's "Christmas".
[2015/12/01 10:56:36] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: axe mess.
[2015/12/01 10:56:40] <Tobbi> *mass
[2015/12/01 10:56:46] <Tobbi> wait, no mess...
[2015/12/01 10:57:12] <Tobbi> Jesus was born and it was a big axe mess.
[2015/12/01 10:57:34] <brmbrmcar> Oh, that is why it's called Christmas.
[2015/12/01 10:57:41] <brmbrmcar> I forgot.
[2015/12/01 10:59:22] <Tobbi> He took my arm, I don't know how it happened... he cut the floor and he said: Oh, don't you dare look back, I'll keep your eyes for me, he said: don't hold it back, I said: Shut up and cut for me.
[2015/12/01 10:59:32] <Tobbi> And he was like: "This torso is my destiny"
[2015/12/01 11:00:25] <brmbrmcar> Why do calenders stop at 24?
[2015/12/01 11:02:17] <Tobbi> Or even better: This chainsaw is my destiny...
[2015/12/01 11:02:41] <brmbrmcar> A saw on a chain?
[2015/12/01 11:03:10] <Tobbi> Shut up and cut with me.

[2015/12/01 11:26:47] <brmbrmcar> Aww.
[2015/12/01 11:27:27] <brmbrmcar> What year was Jesus really born?
[2015/12/01 11:27:33] <brmbrmcar> Don't say 0.
[2015/12/01 11:30:04] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Who knows...Why is it so important...for all I know...he never existed in his form...
[2015/12/01 11:30:10] <Tobbi> *this*
[2015/12/01 11:32:50] <jesusalva> Of course 0 it wasn't. If it was year 0, you could say Jesus didn't existed 'cause there is no year 0 on the calendar, we go straight from 1AD to 1BC.
[2015/12/01 11:33:02] <jesusalva> So roman maths aside
[2015/12/01 11:33:39] <brmbrmcar> I  know, jesusalva.

[2015/12/01 12:12:09] <Tobbi> Hume2: Which ones?
[2015/12/01 12:12:13] <Tobbi> Oh, anyway.

[2015/12/01 12:22:21] <Hume2> Maybe because I thought that "Behind the glaciers" can't be "Po ledovcÃ­ch".
[2015/12/01 12:23:02] <Tobbi> Hume2: Issue with the Czech translation?
[2015/12/01 12:23:06] <Tobbi> Fix it on tx then.
[2015/12/01 12:23:19] <Hume2> Tobbi: I like this translation.
[2015/12/01 12:23:31] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/12/01 12:23:34] <Hume2> It's not exact, but suitable.
[2015/12/01 12:25:00] <Tobbi> Hume2: Could you try downloading the Czech translation file for world1, then put it in the right place and see if the dialogue between penny and tux gets translated?
[2015/12/01 12:25:03] <Tobbi> Just want to make sure that it does
[2015/12/01 12:25:43] <Tobbi> then of course reset your index to HEAD

[2015/12/01 13:05:11] <brmbrmcar> So where is the source?
[2015/12/01 13:05:32] <mt> https://github.com/notifico/notifico
[2015/12/01 13:05:53] <Tobbi> Translating "Graveyard Shift" as "Nachtschicht" in the Halloween levels make them sound a lot less scary :D
[2015/12/01 13:06:48] <brmbrmcar> Why is everything on GitHub?
[2015/12/01 13:07:00] <Tobbi> Because github is the best...
[2015/12/01 13:07:13] <mt> Because nobody wants to use MS CodePlex
[2015/12/01 13:07:20] <Tobbi> ...or google code.
[2015/12/01 13:07:25] <Tobbi> Oh, wait that doesn't exist anymore.
[2015/12/01 13:07:27] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/01 13:07:38] <mt> and people are just starting to use GitLab(.com| CE| EE)
[2015/12/01 13:08:31] <brmbrmcar> Makeyour own site for it. :D
[2015/12/01 13:09:06] <mt> tbh I'd probably use GitLab CE for self-hosting
[2015/12/01 13:09:43] <brmbrmcar> GitHub charges people for stuff!
[2015/12/01 13:10:21] <mt> then use GitLab.com, afaik they don't have priced services yet
[2015/12/01 13:12:23] <brmbrmcar> Yeah, but...
[2015/12/01 13:12:32] <brmbrmcar> I want my own git site!
[2015/12/01 13:12:41] <mt> then get a VPS or a dedi
[2015/12/01 13:12:51] <mt> and host GitLab CE on it
[2015/12/01 13:13:12] <mt> or simply the C-based gitweb
[2015/12/01 13:13:26] <mt> or Gogs
[2015/12/01 13:13:40] <brmbrmcar> Not GitHub!
[2015/12/01 13:13:45] <brmbrmcar> Or GitLab!
[2015/12/01 13:14:04] <mt> GitLab CE is open-source, fwiw
[2015/12/01 13:14:15] <brmbrmcar> GitHub is not.
[2015/12/01 13:14:32] <Tobbi> mt: Is Gitlab CE better than gogs in terms of resource usage?
[2015/12/01 13:14:35] <brmbrmcar> As far as I know of.
[2015/12/01 13:14:36] <Tobbi> Can it run on a rbp
[2015/12/01 13:15:00] <mt> dunno
[2015/12/01 13:15:17] <Tobbi> oh, rbp 2...they have setup instructions for that.
[2015/12/01 13:15:24] <Tobbi> I should probably get myself a rbp 2
[2015/12/01 13:15:30] <mt> get and rbp 0
[2015/12/01 13:15:36] <mt> it's just $5
[2015/12/01 13:16:19] <brmbrmcar> Why pay?
[2015/12/01 13:16:20] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/01 13:16:34] <mt> EUR5.61 with 19% VAT in Germany ;)
[2015/12/01 13:16:47] <Tobbi> I wouldn't run a git server on that...
[2015/12/01 13:16:51] <Tobbi> Might kill itself.
[2015/12/01 13:16:53] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/01 13:17:14] <mt> it's "40x faster than the first-gen Pi B"
[2015/12/01 13:17:24] <Tobbi> mt: What? :D
[2015/12/01 13:17:36] <Tobbi> mt: How does it compare against RBP 2?
[2015/12/01 13:17:48] @ Icefoxfireho21 joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/01 13:17:51] <mt> er, 40 times

[2015/12/01 13:18:06] <mt> but still
[2015/12/01 13:18:14] <Tobbi> lol, i might get that.
[2015/12/01 13:18:16] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/01 13:18:35] <Tobbi> I believe I am running a rbp first gen here...
[2015/12/01 13:18:54] <Tobbi> mt: What about electricity-wise? Shouldn't use as much of that, should it?
[2015/12/01 13:18:59] <mt> when they're available in Germany I'll probably get some for running Tor relays
[2015/12/01 13:19:35] <mt> well 5V 500mA is enough for running a Pi (even tho 800mA is probably better), so 2.5W
[2015/12/01 13:19:42] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/12/01 13:19:53] <Tobbi> Anyway, bbl...doing some sports.

[2015/12/01 18:00:13] <head8debian> Good evening Tobbi and jesusalva and the rest of the team.
[2015/12/01 18:00:27] <Tobbi> hello head8debian, may the schwartz be with you.
[2015/12/01 18:00:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: I just realized i have a party to go to the day of our release.
[2015/12/01 18:00:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: What kind of brand is that?
[2015/12/01 18:00:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: Just a reference to Spaceballs.
[2015/12/01 18:00:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: So, could we get this release done early? I guess i could try to get up early/
[2015/12/01 18:01:08] <head8debian> I did say *try*.
[2015/12/01 18:01:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: What's early for you?
[2015/12/01 18:04:29] <Tobbi> head8debian: what time is it now, how many hours are you ahead of me?
[2015/12/01 18:05:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its 18:00 here. Early would be 6:00 for me... i'd have about an hour and a half to help before having to go out.
[2015/12/01 18:05:28] <Tobbi> So, that would be noon for me, right?
[2015/12/01 18:05:36] <head8debian> Uhm, would it?
[2015/12/01 18:05:49] <Tobbi> head8debian: it's midnight for me right now
[2015/12/01 18:06:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Then it would be.
[2015/12/01 18:06:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: We certainly could do the release at noon.
[2015/12/01 18:06:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: We should create a release planning task list.
[2015/12/01 18:07:11] <Tobbi> Make sure we don't forget stuff.
[2015/12/01 18:07:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: Good idea
[2015/12/01 18:08:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: Shall I create an issue?
[2015/12/01 18:08:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: I should be able to get up at that time as long as my family doesn't hear me....
[2015/12/01 18:08:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sure.
[2015/12/01 18:08:33] <Tobbi> head8debian: When do you normally get up?
[2015/12/01 18:09:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: 7:30, but then im not available untill rightly 10:00
[2015/12/01 18:09:29] <head8debian> roughly*
[2015/12/01 18:09:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: And i will have from 10:00 to 12:00 open.
[2015/12/01 18:10:05] <Tobbi> Hmm... 10am...is 4pm here...
[2015/12/01 18:10:07] <Tobbi> So, maybe...
[2015/12/01 18:11:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whatever you want to do. I don't really like getting up early...
[2015/12/01 18:11:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, let's target 4pm
[2015/12/01 18:11:58] <Tobbi> Leaves us more time...
[2015/12/01 18:12:10] <Tobbi> 10am for you.
[2015/12/01 18:12:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok.
[2015/12/01 18:12:57] <Tobbi> Good.
[2015/12/01 18:13:01] <Tobbi> And it's a sunday...

[2015/12/01 18:24:54] <maths22> Also, working windows builds coming soon!

[2015/12/01 18:29:15] <maths22> Tobbi: That won't change.  Sorry, but CPack doesn't support it (however, there will be an uninstall button in the folder as well)

[2015/12/01 18:29:29] <Tobbi> I don't really mind.
[2015/12/01 18:30:02] <maths22> I have also updated the numbering scheme (so the lastest version is actually 0.3.5.447)
[2015/12/01 18:30:13] <Tobbi> I'm so damn happy when this release is out of the door...

[2015/12/01 18:30:34] <maths22> Tobbi: yep.  Git describe
[2015/12/01 18:30:38] <Tobbi> Ah!
[2015/12/01 18:31:26] <maths22> The window heading has "v0.3.5-447-g58285e5"
[2015/12/01 18:31:50] <Tobbi> maths22: But should have 0.4.0 as soon as that's out the door, right? aka, properly tagged...
[2015/12/01 18:32:30] <Tobbi> maths22: Is there anything else I might have forgotten on that release list?
[2015/12/01 18:32:33] <maths22> Tobbi: exactly.  It relies on the git tag to get a version number
[2015/12/01 18:33:03] <maths22> I don't think so.  I'm going to try to get builds working very soon
[2015/12/01 18:34:13] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/12/01 18:34:46] <maths22> And my changes break travis.  Fixing... (This is why it went on its own branch)

[2015/12/02 09:17:16] <Tobbi> hey maths22
[2015/12/02 09:17:30] <maths22> That underscore thing is odd
[2015/12/02 09:18:16] <Tobbi> maths22: git describe gives me 0_3_5-502-gc997b70
[2015/12/02 09:18:30] <Tobbi> Maybe it depends on git version?
[2015/12/02 09:18:40] <Tobbi> mine is git version 2.4.9 (Apple Git-60)
[2015/12/02 09:21:19] <maths22> Tobbi: can you paste the output of "git tag" for me?
[2015/12/02 09:21:25] <maths22> (In a pastebin or something)
[2015/12/02 09:21:56] <Tobbi> maths22: http://pastebin.com/Ae87yFLy I guess I understand now.
[2015/12/02 09:22:05] <Tobbi> So, I might have old tags that haven|t been cleaned up.
[2015/12/02 09:22:10] <maths22> Correct
[2015/12/02 09:22:27] <Tobbi> hrm...
[2015/12/02 09:22:31] <maths22> Leave the underscore splitter in the cmake file, but it isn't actually necessary
[2015/12/02 09:22:44] <Tobbi> Okay, I will try to clean them up.
[2015/12/02 09:23:08] <maths22> I predict you will get different output once you do that
[2015/12/02 09:23:24] <maths22> (I had thought you had underscores instead of dashes, which would be a git issue)
[2015/12/02 09:23:41] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/12/02 09:24:28] <Tobbi> I thought so too...I didn|t think of tags.
[2015/12/02 09:26:47] <Tobbi> Yup, now it says v0.3.5-502-gc997b70
[2015/12/02 09:26:50] <Tobbi> Which seems to be good

[2015/12/02 12:46:11] <brmbrmcar> I don't know much in this area.
[2015/12/02 12:55:14] <brmbrmcar> Maybe they would actually need to be implemented into the SuperTux source code to work.

[2015/12/02 13:07:03] <Hume2> This is a list of commands for Tux.
[2015/12/02 13:07:13] <brmbrmcar> Thanks.
[2015/12/02 13:07:39] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It looks like Tobbi knows a lot, but not everything.
[2015/12/02 13:07:43] <brmbrmcar> I want to try adding set_bonus.
[2015/12/02 13:08:24] <Hume2> I'll try to add this command here.
[2015/12/02 13:09:11] <brmbrmcar> Where are these things defined?
[2015/12/02 13:09:42] <brmbrmcar> Because I know that just typing in set_bonus is never going to work.
[2015/12/02 13:11:04] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/src/object/player.cpp
[2015/12/02 13:11:52] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Thanks. Looks very long.
[2015/12/02 13:12:26] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Is that what you usually talk about with Tobbi?
[2015/12/02 13:12:55] <brmbrmcar> Noo.
[2015/12/02 13:13:31] <brmbrmcar> Will just removing all the ifs and just running it work?
[2015/12/02 13:13:44] <brmbrmcar> Just return add_bonus(type);
[2015/12/02 13:14:48] <Hume2> add_bonus("none") should work another way then set_bonus(none), shouldn't it?
[2015/12/02 13:15:29] <brmbrmcar> Yes. But add_bonus("none") doesn't work.
[2015/12/02 13:15:58] <Hume2> :D That's what I'm now working on.
[2015/12/02 13:16:59] <brmbrmcar> Good.
[2015/12/02 13:17:20] <brmbrmcar> Worst scripting ever https://github.com/brmbrmcar/supertux/commit/20d576a5d8b5c20d08d1ed147d69e3f23fd90b80.
[2015/12/02 13:17:27] <brmbrmcar> Not even complete.
[2015/12/02 13:18:13] <leyyin> why does your function accept a parameter that you are not using?
[2015/12/02 13:18:25] <mt> brmbrmcar: I hope you'll reword your commit messages when you're done
[2015/12/02 13:18:45] <brmbrmcar> That code just disabled everything.
[2015/12/02 13:23:54] <brmbrmcar> A poor none bonus method could be if fireflower etc shrink twice, growup once, none never.
[2015/12/02 13:24:37] <Karkus> That is true. Well done.
[2015/12/02 13:24:53] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I have it nearly done. I'm just testing it.

[2015/12/02 13:25:37] <brmbrmcar> What was your fix?
[2015/12/02 13:26:29] <Hume2> *sigh*
[2015/12/02 13:26:45] <Hume2> It's more complicated.
[2015/12/02 13:27:23] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Do never suggest your way to Tobbi. Good advice.
[2015/12/02 13:28:41] <brmbrmcar> Yours probably works. Mine probably will blow up.
[2015/12/02 13:32:22] <Hume2> The squirel seems more complicated than I thought...

[2015/12/02 13:41:36] <brmbrmcar> How about new none()?

[2015/12/02 14:01:46] <leyyin> no, open source projects have a a bad reputation for code quality....
[2015/12/02 14:01:51] <vpx> shouldn't I be able to call sector.set_gravity( float ) from the console?
[2015/12/02 14:02:08] <vpx> they do, but they shouldn't ..
[2015/12/02 14:02:09] <Tobbi> leyyin, Bad reputation meaning "being slaggish"?
[2015/12/02 14:02:31] <leyyin> lacking in consistency, ugly code, etc
[2015/12/02 14:02:40] <Tobbi> leyyin, SuperTux is lacking in consistency as well.
[2015/12/02 14:02:52] <Tobbi> As for ugly code...I don't know. I've been trying to avoid this.
[2015/12/02 14:03:33] <leyyin> look at openssl :D
[2015/12/02 14:03:38] <leyyin> so nice
[2015/12/02 14:03:45] <Tobbi> vpx, If it isn't there, you can program it in. An example should be in the most recent commits.
[2015/12/02 14:03:51] <vpx> hmm
[2015/12/02 14:04:02] <vpx> the funcion set_gravity is in scripting/ssector.hpp
[2015/12/02 14:04:05] <vpx> as well as the sector file itself
[2015/12/02 14:04:09] <Tobbi> leyyin, I am so burnt out...
[2015/12/02 14:04:16] <Tobbi> I don't know anything about motivation...
[2015/12/02 14:04:18] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/02 14:04:49] <vpx> but the console still says that the index 'set_gravity' does not exist
[2015/12/02 14:05:04] <Tobbi> A squirrel wrapper needs to exist.
[2015/12/02 14:05:33] <vpx> from what I understand, isn't that the src/scripting/ssector.hpp
[2015/12/02 14:05:34] <vpx> ?Â»
[2015/12/02 14:05:35] <leyyin> Tobbi, so I am like your advisor or something?
[2015/12/02 14:05:46] <Tobbi> leyyin, Yes... :P
[2015/12/02 14:05:56] <Tobbi> leyyin, No, you're not...never mind.
[2015/12/02 14:06:10] <Tobbi> vpx, No, it isn't.
[2015/12/02 14:06:12] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2015/12/02 14:07:00] <leyyin> I have +20% OCD bonus

[2015/12/02 14:08:10] <Tobbi> src/scripting/wrapper.cpp
[2015/12/02 14:08:23] <Tobbi> If you want to help, create such a wrapper for that function above that you miss.
[2015/12/02 14:11:05] <vpx> Oh, i didn't notice that file
[2015/12/02 14:11:08] <vpx> Will take a look, thanks
[2015/12/02 14:11:17] <Tobbi> vpx, If you do, please create a pull request.
[2015/12/02 14:11:24] <Tobbi> We can merge that in before the release in 3 weeks.
[2015/12/02 14:11:47] <vpx> I will if I manage to make this work right
[2015/12/02 14:13:27] <Tobbi> leyyin, I will let some other person lead SuperTux for a while. If Hume or brmbrmcar think they can be better project leaders than me, fine...
[2015/12/02 14:13:33] <Tobbi> No need to stress myself over it.

[2015/12/02 14:47:11] <Tobbi> Karkus, mt: If people have a problem with me, they are free to a) leave the project or b) tell me in the face...
[2015/12/02 14:47:56] <Tobbi> I'd prefer 1) because complains about me are most likely the sign that there's something wrong with the person having problems with me.
[2015/12/02 14:48:01] <Tobbi> I. am. flawless.
[2015/12/02 14:48:36] <Karkus> That's a quote to keep :D
[2015/12/02 14:48:54] <Tobbi> Karkus, I have it hanging above my bed since I was born.
[2015/12/02 14:49:21] <brmbrmcar> I will resist an annoying comment.
[2015/12/02 14:49:23] <Karkus> You could probably convince me that was true :P
[2015/12/02 14:49:27] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/02 14:49:29] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Please do
[2015/12/02 14:49:37] <brmbrmcar> Well...
[2015/12/02 14:50:01] <Tobbi> Karkus, To be honest, I really have a problem with authority.
[2015/12/02 14:50:06] <Tobbi> And that's a problem in itself.
[2015/12/02 14:50:27] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi got a and 1 confused, and then said he was flawless.
[2015/12/02 14:51:03] <brmbrmcar> It depends what he means by "flawless".

[2015/12/02 17:32:26] <Tobbi_> head8debian: Have you ever put a cow upside-down?

[2015/12/02 17:33:16] <Tobbi_> head8debian: But, in order to prevent accidents, you need to find out when it kills them and when it doesn't.
[2015/12/02 17:33:27] <Tobbi_> Because, if a cow accidentally gets turned upside down, or inside out...
[2015/12/02 17:33:32] <Tobbi_> Well...you know what to do.
[2015/12/02 17:33:59] <head8debian> Tobbi_: You cannot do anything when they get a twisted stomach. If we could we would love to know how.
[2015/12/02 17:34:32] <Tobbi_> head8debian: All you need is a lot of hot air pressure... then the cow inflates and the stomach untwists...
[2015/12/02 17:34:42] <Tobbi_> Actually, I am making that up as I go along.

[2015/12/03 10:30:08] <head8debian> maths22: So, you are going to work on a OSX build today?
[2015/12/03 10:30:44] <Tobbi> hello foot9ubuntu

[2015/12/03 10:35:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: ...
[2015/12/03 10:35:39] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Will you be civil today and not be getting on our nerves?
[2015/12/03 10:36:19] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/12/03 10:36:37] <brmbrmcar> Thw Windsows builds aren't working on Wine...
[2015/12/03 10:36:47] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Error message?
[2015/12/03 10:37:00] <brmbrmcar> None.
[2015/12/03 10:37:14] <brmbrmcar> It compiles, but doesn't sart.
[2015/12/03 10:37:28] <brmbrmcar> bin/supertux2.exe
[2015/12/03 10:37:30] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: That should still give you an error message.
[2015/12/03 10:37:42] <brmbrmcar> How?
[2015/12/03 10:37:45] <brmbrmcar> Where?
[2015/12/03 10:38:30] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How do you start the build?
[2015/12/03 10:38:42] <brmbrmcar> I just downloaded it.
[2015/12/03 10:39:16] <brmbrmcar> I opened he file,and followed the instructions.
[2015/12/03 10:39:41] <brmbrmcar> Open with Wine.
[2015/12/03 10:43:55] <leyyin> Tobbi, do you want to hear something funny?
[2015/12/03 10:44:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: Sure.
[2015/12/03 10:45:06] <leyyin> this year at my university, the 'Security' course is taught by Bitdefender (the anti-virus company), well they got good teachers, because last summer they got caught with having stored PLAIN PASSWORDS http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/07/31/bitdefender-hacked/
[2015/12/03 10:45:08] <leyyin> idiots
[2015/12/03 10:45:40] <leyyin> how the heck can you store plain text passwords, and you are a security firm......
[2015/12/03 10:45:47] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/03 10:45:58] <leyyin> *this summer
[2015/12/03 10:46:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: How comes they even let outside companies teach a security course at a university?
[2015/12/03 10:46:38] <leyyin> because we are corporate slaves
[2015/12/03 10:46:53] <leyyin> we have 3-4 (optional courses) taught by people from corporations
[2015/12/03 10:47:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: At least they're optional...
[2015/12/03 10:48:02] <Tobbi> leyyin: Our small university is too small to be corporate slaves anyway...
[2015/12/03 10:49:03] <leyyin> well it depends on semester, you got too choose some optional courses
[2015/12/03 10:49:08] <leyyin> 2 out of 6 courses
[2015/12/03 10:49:13] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/12/03 10:49:27] <Tobbi> leyyin: Want to know what I noticed? I worry too much :P
[2015/12/03 10:49:43] <leyyin> so this is unheard off in Germany? having corporations teach a course?
[2015/12/03 10:49:57] <leyyin> do you have ads at your university?
[2015/12/03 10:49:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: Probably not... But it's not common, I'd think.
[2015/12/03 10:50:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: No?
[2015/12/03 10:50:08] <leyyin> by corporations ? :D
[2015/12/03 10:50:11] <leyyin> we have them too
[2015/12/03 10:50:22] <Tobbi> leyyin: Universities are not private...
[2015/12/03 10:50:29] <leyyin> yeah
[2015/12/03 10:50:32] <leyyin> this one too
[2015/12/03 10:50:38] <Tobbi> That's weird.
[2015/12/03 10:50:39] <leyyin> but we got ads by corporations :D
[2015/12/03 10:50:52] <leyyin> "Check out our awesome company"
[2015/12/03 10:50:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: That is totally mental.
[2015/12/03 10:50:55] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/03 10:51:10] <leyyin> even in big lecture rooms
[2015/12/03 10:51:14] <leyyin> in front of the class
[2015/12/03 10:51:28] <brmbrmcar> Can I put up an ad?
[2015/12/03 10:51:45] <leyyin> Tobbi, and friends think I am crazy when I tell them this is not normal :D
[2015/12/03 10:52:13] <Tobbi> leyyin: Okay, tell them to come to the Fachhochschule Flensburg. There are no ads, never...
[2015/12/03 10:52:21] <Tobbi> leyyin: We do, however, have a list of openings...
[2015/12/03 10:52:31] <Tobbi> But that's not the same.
[2015/12/03 10:53:51] <leyyin> list of openings?
[2015/12/03 10:54:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: ubuntu is not debian, and ubuntu is still not stuck on version 9.
[2015/12/03 10:54:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: job openings...
[2015/12/03 10:54:32] <Tobbi> So, companies post their openings on to a blackboard.
[2015/12/03 10:54:40] <leyyin> ah ok, that is totally different
[2015/12/03 10:55:02] <brmbrmcar> Debian is better than Ubuntu.
[2015/12/03 10:55:18] <leyyin> linux is better than debian
[2015/12/03 10:55:45] <leyyin> Tobbi, thank you for making me feel normal :D
[2015/12/03 10:55:52] <leyyin> so I am not crazy when I am against those ads
[2015/12/03 10:56:02] <Tobbi> leyyin: Normal depends on your definition...
[2015/12/03 10:56:14] <brmbrmcar> Debian is Linux.
[2015/12/03 10:56:21] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, impossible
[2015/12/03 10:56:27] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, debian is a fork of windows
[2015/12/03 10:56:31] <brmbrmcar> Linux distro
[2015/12/03 10:56:38] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, not true
[2015/12/03 10:56:46] <brmbrmcar> leyyin: You are messing with me.
[2015/12/03 10:56:55] <leyyin> not true either :D
[2015/12/03 10:57:00] <brmbrmcar> I HATE WINDOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[2015/12/03 10:58:56] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You're messing with yourself.
[2015/12/03 10:59:17] <brmbrmcar> Nope.
[2015/12/03 10:59:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: Do these outside lecturers advertise their company?
[2015/12/03 10:59:31] <leyyin> Tobbi, idk, I never went to one
[2015/12/03 10:59:32] <leyyin> Tobbi, ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)
[2015/12/03 10:59:37] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2015/12/03 10:59:43] <leyyin> [17:56:30] <@Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You're messing with yourself.
[2015/12/03 10:59:53] <brmbrmcar> 15:57:17 < leyyin> [17:56:30] <@Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You're messing with yourself.
[2015/12/03 11:00:10] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, we had one lecturer who was the boss of spielen.de, an online platform for online games...
[2015/12/03 11:00:11] <brmbrmcar> leyyin started it!
[2015/12/03 11:00:24] <Tobbi> But he told us something about how to run a company etc.
[2015/12/03 11:00:26] <maths22> head8debian: Hopefully
[2015/12/03 11:00:33] <Tobbi> And did not advertise it in any way.
[2015/12/03 11:00:56] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Okay, so, if you mess with me, I will kick you, leyyin has free reign...but he is a respected member of this community.
[2015/12/03 11:00:59] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Which file, and what is the error?
[2015/12/03 11:01:34] <leyyin> hmm, I am an asshole, why I am respected thought
[2015/12/03 11:01:38] <leyyin> weird people :D
[2015/12/03 11:02:08] <Tobbi> leyyin: I can talk normally with you, thus you're respected.
[2015/12/03 11:02:14] <brmbrmcar> maths22: How do you get the errr message?
[2015/12/03 11:02:34] <brmbrmcar> maths22: I booted from bin/supertux2.exe
[2015/12/03 11:02:49] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Which installer version?
[2015/12/03 11:03:34] <brmbrmcar> I don't know. But I used SuperTux-0.3.5.507-win32.msi.
[2015/12/03 11:03:42] <maths22> That answers my question
[2015/12/03 11:03:49] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/03 11:04:24] <maths22> Try running it through the command line 'wine /path/to/bin/supertux2.exe'
[2015/12/03 11:04:32] <maths22> That should give you the error message
[2015/12/03 11:04:45] <maths22> (Otherwise, I'll try wine later today when I am running linux)

[2015/12/03 11:55:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: When I comment on flexlay, notifico doesn't notify
[2015/12/03 11:55:22] <Tobbi> hmm, okay.
[2015/12/03 11:55:32] <Tobbi> mt: ^^
[2015/12/03 11:55:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could only show background images if the zoom level is above a certain value.
[2015/12/03 11:55:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: When I push, it works, but not in the same way
[2015/12/03 11:56:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: We could...
[2015/12/03 11:56:15] <Tobbi> how does the old editor do it?
[2015/12/03 11:56:25] <Tobbi> Can anyone of you guys check?
[2015/12/03 11:56:30] <Karkus> Just tiles them lots of times
[2015/12/03 11:56:38] <Karkus> I took a screen shot
[2015/12/03 11:57:08] <brmbrmcar> Which old editor?
[2015/12/03 11:57:33] <Tobbi> Oh, so that's the old one...
[2015/12/03 11:57:34] <Tobbi> right...
[2015/12/03 11:57:36] <Tobbi> of course.
[2015/12/03 11:57:45] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'm going to tranfer all the labels from supertux to flexlay, is that okay?
[2015/12/03 11:57:48] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/12/03 11:57:58] <Tobbi> makes sense.
[2015/12/03 11:58:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's the old one, yes
[2015/12/03 11:58:03] <brmbrmcar> Background shows fine on the 0.3.4-git one.
[2015/12/03 11:58:20] <Tobbi> tomorrow's my graduation party...
[2015/12/03 11:58:36] <Tobbi> well "party"
[2015/12/03 11:58:36] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Shows fine?
[2015/12/03 11:58:47] <Karkus> Why '"party"'?
[2015/12/03 11:59:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: Because it's just a graduation celebration with the president of the university and all graduates.
[2015/12/03 11:59:19] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: I mean on the standard editor.
[2015/12/03 11:59:20] <Tobbi> And family members.
[2015/12/03 11:59:28] <Tobbi> My father'll attend as well...
[2015/12/03 11:59:35] <Tobbi> And I had to debrief him on proper conduct.
[2015/12/03 11:59:45] <Karkus> : )
[2015/12/03 12:00:13] <mt> Karkus: well, notifico isn't set up for flexlay
[2015/12/03 12:00:13] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Please can you show me what 'shows fine' means (with a screenshot)
[2015/12/03 12:00:21] <Karkus> mt: How can I set it up?
[2015/12/03 12:00:23] <mt> and  github's commit bot doesn't announce comments
[2015/12/03 12:00:33] <mt> I can set up an hook URL
[2015/12/03 12:00:41] <mt> and then give it to Tobbi in PM
[2015/12/03 12:00:58] <mt> (or do you happen to have admin access to the flexlay repo)
[2015/12/03 12:01:14] <Karkus> Admin access?
[2015/12/03 12:01:15] <mt> because anyone with access to it could spam the channel using the notifico bots
[2015/12/03 12:01:45] <Karkus> I am a 'Contributor'
[2015/12/03 12:01:54] <brmbrmcar> http://i.cubeupload.com/X0BSYm.png
[2015/12/03 12:02:14] <mt> then you don't have admin access
[2015/12/03 12:02:31] <Tobbi> One moment.
[2015/12/03 12:02:35] <Tobbi> Let me see if Karkus has.
[2015/12/03 12:02:56] <brmbrmcar> Contributor? For what?
[2015/12/03 12:03:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: I added you to the admin group.
[2015/12/03 12:04:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, thanks :D

[2015/12/03 12:18:48] <mt> commit #243: "Edit by @maxteufel, 2015-12-03 16:15 UTC: Added Arch Linux to list of people to notify"
[2015/12/03 12:19:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yeah, that resource library idea is a minor one... :P
[2015/12/03 12:19:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: Shouldn't be too difficult though.
[2015/12/03 12:19:51] <Tobbi> That's right.
[2015/12/03 12:23:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Should it search the whole data directory?
[2015/12/03 12:24:12] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could search the directories for certain things...data/image for sprite files, data/music for ogg, right?
[2015/12/03 12:24:22] <Tobbi> Is faster than searching data/ fullz.
[2015/12/03 12:24:23] <Tobbi> fully
[2015/12/03 12:24:30] <Karkus> Yep
[2015/12/03 12:25:58] <mt> re people to ping about release I guess that'd also be @amigadave (https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/packager/amigadave/) and possibly @Vincent-C
[2015/12/03 12:27:17] <mt> (https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=Vincent+Cheng) for the latter
[2015/12/03 12:27:20] <Tobbi> mt: Add them to the release issue.
[2015/12/03 12:28:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: Does the game search the datadir for .sprite files?
[2015/12/03 12:28:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, it doesn't. The sprite files are hardcoded within the game.
[2015/12/03 12:29:05] <Tobbi> *sprite file paths
[2015/12/03 12:29:30] <Karkus> Hmmm, okay

[2015/12/03 12:31:11] <Karkus> mt: I've wondered that too...
[2015/12/03 12:31:19] <Tobbi> mt: Well, you mentioned yourself, did it notify you?
[2015/12/03 12:31:44] <mt> no, that's not expected because I'm watching the repository anyway
[2015/12/03 12:31:56] <mt> and you also don't get a notification for comments you write
[2015/12/03 12:32:04] <Tobbi> right
[2015/12/03 12:35:58] <Karkus> I edited my comment, mt. Did you get an email?
[2015/12/03 12:36:52] <mt> no
[2015/12/03 12:37:16] <Karkus> There you have it, then

[2015/12/03 12:49:18] <Tobbi> mt, Hume2: We should, however, note non-visible changes as something like "Engine improvements" etc.
[2015/12/03 12:49:32] <mt> yeah
[2015/12/03 12:49:47] <Hume2> Yes, you can just write -Code improvements.

[2015/12/03 12:50:00] <Hume2> Or that. And that stands for all.
[2015/12/03 12:50:08] <Tobbi> Do I put myself as "Project lead"? :P
[2015/12/03 12:50:21] <Tobbi> I'd rather not take on that role, but others attribute it to me :D

[2015/12/03 12:54:34] <brmbrmcar> What about the other 10&?
[2015/12/03 12:54:35] <Tobbi> maths22: What changes would you do that has an effect on XP?
[2015/12/03 12:54:46] <Hume2> However, Windows XP is still better than 10.
[2015/12/03 12:54:47] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Translators do have a lot to translate.
[2015/12/03 12:54:53] <maths22> Tobbi: It's a compiler thing, not a source thing
[2015/12/03 12:54:56] <mt> I'd say: don't even think about supporting unsupported software
[2015/12/03 12:55:02] <brmbrmcar> So, what will it look like?
[2015/12/03 12:55:21] <brmbrmcar> With incomplete translations?
[2015/12/03 12:55:23] <maths22> mt: This is my belief, but I just wanted to check, since Visual Studio 2012+ builds don't run on XP

[2015/12/03 12:55:39] <Tobbi> maths22: If there's a high enough demand for SuperTux on XP, we can create an executable on XP.
[2015/12/03 12:55:45] <Tobbi> But, wait, XP is soo old.
[2015/12/03 12:56:03] <Hume2> ...but better than Windows 7.
[2015/12/03 12:56:04] <mt> if it's more than 'just change one line', forget it?
[2015/12/03 12:56:25] <brmbrmcar> What was always wrong with Vista?
[2015/12/03 12:56:34] <mt> Hume2: I disagree, tbh
[2015/12/03 12:56:52] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Vista is just slow. That's all.
[2015/12/03 12:57:08] <Hume2> However, Windows 7 has IQ 7.
[2015/12/03 12:57:32] <brmbrmcar> All Windows is awful.
[2015/12/03 12:57:38] <maths22> I'm using the IE vms to test the installer on old versions, and started with XP (where it didn't run)
[2015/12/03 12:57:41] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2015/12/03 12:57:57] <maths22> I'm now trying 7.  The good thing is it is a clean install, so I will know if any dependencies are missing
[2015/12/03 12:58:11] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/12/03 12:58:23] <maths22> Tobbi: really, I don't care if it runs in Wine
[2015/12/03 12:58:39] <Tobbi> maths22: That's alright... :D We publish native executables anyway.
[2015/12/03 12:58:43] <maths22> We have native linux builds, so if Wine doesn't like it, its not the end of the world
[2015/12/03 12:58:56] <maths22> Tobbi: exactly
[2015/12/03 12:59:00] <brmbrmcar> Yeah, but I prefer running stuff in Wine on Linux.
[2015/12/03 12:59:12] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: ...
[2015/12/03 12:59:14] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Why do you not like the native builds?
[2015/12/03 12:59:51] <brmbrmcar> I can't seem to ever get the linux ones working, and it uses less disk space.
[2015/12/03 13:00:10] <brmbrmcar> Because on Wine you can just throw away the soycre.
[2015/12/03 13:00:24] <Karkus> I dual boot Windows 10, so I can double check that
[2015/12/03 13:00:28] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Linux builds should not include source [binary ones anyways]
[2015/12/03 13:00:53] <maths22> Karkus: Thanks.  I do the same, but I have all the dev tools installed, so the vms give me a nice clean slate
[2015/12/03 13:01:09] <brmbrmcar> Karku:I mean the thing to install from.
[2015/12/03 13:01:18] <brmbrmcar> I meant maths22 then.
[2015/12/03 13:01:26] <Karkus> maths22: Okay
[2015/12/03 13:01:46] <mt> maths22: uh, builds are usually binaries :P
[2015/12/03 13:01:54] <maths22> mt: I know
[2015/12/03 13:02:03] <Tobbi> Not for something like JavaScript :P
[2015/12/03 13:02:05] <maths22> brmbrmcar was confusing me, and I gave a confusing reply back :(
[2015/12/03 13:02:32] <brmbrmcar> maths22: Where is the Linux source file anyway? You know, that tar.gz one.
[2015/12/03 13:02:47] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Not yet being built.
[2015/12/03 13:02:54] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/03 13:03:49] <Tobbi> What is this individual complaining about, anyway? http://a062.apm.etc.tu-bs.de/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=5175#p5175
[2015/12/03 13:03:53] <maths22> I'm dissapointed with the installer.  The background graphics don't work in Windows 7
[2015/12/03 13:04:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: You should announce the new Twitter page on the website
[2015/12/03 13:04:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, yes, I should.
[2015/12/03 13:04:28] <Tobbi> Actually, it needs to be done in the source files as well...

[2015/12/03 13:37:56] <Tobbi> I really have no idea.

[2015/12/03 13:45:30] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/12/03 13:45:35] <Tobbi> uhm...
[2015/12/03 13:45:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, these are the default sprites for badguys, they should stay as they are.
[2015/12/03 13:46:05] <Karkus> What I've commented out, you mean?
[2015/12/03 13:46:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: yes.
[2015/12/03 13:46:14] <Tobbi> What we need is a general sprite library.
[2015/12/03 13:46:18] <Tobbi> That includes all sprites.
[2015/12/03 13:46:22] <Tobbi> All found ones.
[2015/12/03 13:46:39] <maths22> The current installer creates a system that only works on Windows 10.  That will be fixed tonight
[2015/12/03 13:46:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hmm, what do you mean?
[2015/12/03 13:47:30] <Karkus> What I've tried to do is automatically load all the sprites and badguys
[2015/12/03 13:47:36] <Tobbi> Ah...
[2015/12/03 13:47:42] <Tobbi> wait a minute.
[2015/12/03 13:47:47] <Tobbi> Yes, that's a good idea actually.

[2015/12/03 13:48:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Problem is exactly what you pointed out: Directory names don't correlate with badguy names.
[2015/12/03 13:48:33] <Tobbi> So, unfortunately that part of the code needs to stay intact.
[2015/12/03 13:49:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hmm, so where could I get the names from?
[2015/12/03 13:49:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, it's useless hardcoding it in
[2015/12/03 13:49:38] <Tobbi> right.
[2015/12/03 13:50:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: You could use the directory name...
[2015/12/03 13:50:26] <Tobbi> Seems like that's the only thing that can be used.
[2015/12/03 13:50:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is that always correct?
[2015/12/03 13:51:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, it doesn't need to be correct, right? What I am thinking of when I mean "Sprite library" is a window that has a list of categories (maybe the names of the directory) and on the right it displays the sprites found in that directory.
[2015/12/03 13:51:55] <Tobbi> Maybe I haven't thought this through....
[2015/12/03 13:52:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, when you want to specify a sprite for a badguy, the library opens, you select the sprite and it copies its filename.
[2015/12/03 13:53:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Custom badguys?
[2015/12/03 13:53:18] <Hume2> No, just the sprites.
[2015/12/03 13:53:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, not in terms of behaviour, but in terms of how they look.
[2015/12/03 13:53:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: badguys have a sprite property in the lisp file.
[2015/12/03 13:53:40] <Karkus> Is that a useful thing though?
[2015/12/03 13:53:43] <Tobbi> That defines how the badguy looks...
[2015/12/03 13:53:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't know. But it's better than having to copy the filename to the sprite file, right?
[2015/12/03 13:54:00] <Tobbi> At least IMO
[2015/12/03 13:54:07] <brmbrmcar> There should be something to accept define files indata levels.
[2015/12/03 13:54:54] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: That's a lot of words, but not a lot of sense
[2015/12/03 13:55:05] <brmbrmcar> You know, like .c files.
[2015/12/03 13:55:24] <brmbrmcar> That you can add into like a worldmap.
[2015/12/03 13:56:07] <Tobbi> Oh no.

[2015/12/03 13:56:51] <Tobbi> we'd need to integrate a c parser...
[2015/12/03 13:56:52] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: C is a comiled language != scripting
[2015/12/03 13:56:54] <Tobbi> or compiler...
[2015/12/03 13:57:48] <brmbrmcar> How about something that allows more customisability, but not computer destruction.
[2015/12/03 13:59:00] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: We have squirrel, what else do we need?
[2015/12/03 13:59:24] <Tobbi> We should enhance our scripting capabilities after 0.4.0

[2015/12/03 14:07:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: Colours, everything you can...
[2015/12/03 14:07:26] <Hume2> Disco snow!
[2015/12/03 14:07:59] <Tobbi> Yes, that too.
[2015/12/03 14:08:01] <Hume2> It's SuperTux, not DiscoTux :D But I can try.
[2015/12/03 14:12:24] <Tobbi> Hume2: Nah, it's good for post 0.4.0
[2015/12/03 14:12:36] <Tobbi> scripting whatever can be scripted
[2015/12/03 14:14:17] <Hume2> Well, after 0.4.0. There is more important stuff now.
[2015/12/03 14:14:41] <Tobbi> That's right.
[2015/12/03 14:14:47] <Tobbi> Hume2: But scripting is one of these important things.
[2015/12/03 14:15:29] <Hume2> I know, there are more important scripting stuff than disco weather.
[2015/12/03 14:15:49] <brmbrmcar> The invisible wall near the end of Down The Rabbit hole should be replaced.
[2015/12/03 14:16:03] <Tobbi> Hume2: Disco weather is actually rather important :D

[2015/12/03 14:16:19] <Tobbi> It makes for quite an interesting effect.

[2015/12/03 14:48:50] <Hume2> :D Good note.
[2015/12/03 14:50:54] <Hume2> I'd suggest to make only one level a day, else it will look like TeraTux.
[2015/12/03 14:51:50] <Hume2> When I was working on TeraTux, I tried to make 6 levels a day.
[2015/12/03 14:51:50] <Tobbi> Yes.

[2015/12/03 14:51:56] <Tobbi> Why this OCD?
[2015/12/03 14:51:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/03 14:53:01] <brmbrmcar> I made a levelset like TeraTux, apart from it had a load of scripts.
[2015/12/03 14:54:13] <Hume2> How many levels made you a day when working on it?
[2015/12/03 14:55:42] <Hume2> Making more levels a day is really dangerous. The first time I made some decent levels, but after that it started to bore me.
[2015/12/03 14:56:03] <Tobbi> This will hopefully be improved with the new level editor.
[2015/12/03 14:56:40] <Hume2> ...so the levels were crappier and crappier. After that I was so bored, so I couldn't make any level, even a crappy one.
[2015/12/03 14:57:05] <Hume2> Tobbi. I have already seen some crappy levels made in the new editor.

[2015/12/03 17:23:09] <Tobbi> what?
[2015/12/03 17:27:22] <Tobbi> maths22: So, you're using WiX to create the installer. Does it support compression?
[2015/12/03 17:30:06] @ Quit: leyyin: Quit: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
[2015/12/03 17:50:20] <maths22> Tobbi: Sure.  I don't know that it will do very much, but I can see about turning it on
[2015/12/03 17:50:34] <maths22> (The installer is 3 mb bigger than the 0.3.5a one)
[2015/12/03 17:50:43] <Tobbi> maths22: If you can, LZMA2 compression...
[2015/12/03 18:04:57] <maths22> Tobbi: I can't choose the algorithm-sorry.  How much of a size change would that create?
[2015/12/03 18:05:09] <Tobbi> maths22: I am not sure. Could we use NSIS instead?
[2015/12/03 18:05:51] <maths22> Tobbi: I'll see.  Why?
[2015/12/03 18:06:01] <Tobbi> maths22: Because that allows you to set compression.
[2015/12/03 18:06:02] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/03 18:06:10] <Tobbi> LZMA2 as well, afiak.
[2015/12/03 18:07:40] <maths22> Running now-will compare output sizes
[2015/12/03 18:07:49] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2015/12/03 18:09:47] <Tobbi> It allows setting LZMA, not LZMA2...
[2015/12/03 18:09:49] <Tobbi> but still...
[2015/12/03 18:15:37] <maths22> With high compression set on WIX, it is a 2 mb difference
[2015/12/03 18:17:42] <maths22> Do you have any other reason to prefer one or the other?
[2015/12/03 18:18:09] <maths22> WIX has much better handling of upgrades
[2015/12/03 18:19:41] <Tobbi> maths22: No, it's fine.
[2015/12/03 18:19:44] <Tobbi> Just use WiX then.

[2015/12/03 18:21:52] <Tobbi> I guess since it's mostly binary files...
[2015/12/03 18:21:58] <Tobbi> it wouldn't compress well, anyway.

[2015/12/03 20:40:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: That is odd.
[2015/12/03 20:40:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, it's not the actual download that is causing the problem?

[2015/12/03 20:46:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: The video is uploading. Notice that the audio starts much earlier. That is not normal, and when you first run after building it sits and appears to do nothing for quite a while.
[2015/12/03 20:46:42] <head8debian> :)

[2015/12/04 08:53:16] <jesusalva> Belive me, it's worse in Brazil. If you work late from 22:00 to 05:00, you must receive 50% bonus by extra time, 20% bonus by night time, the hours worked are different, each hour haves only 52 minutes...
[2015/12/04 08:53:51] <jesusalva> And you still need to calc how much he will gain by sundays, and besides, if the work is dangerous or may damage your health, you have extra bonuses.
[2015/12/04 08:54:32] <jesusalva> Which must be considered before calculating the extra time you worked at night. Not even to say about calcs of Brazilian taxes.

[2015/12/04 15:41:02] <Hume2> Hello, Karkus.
[2015/12/04 15:41:45] <Hume2> I'm just wonder that some people don't know what objects we have in SuperTux.
[2015/12/04 15:42:31] <Hume2> Well, some people, but I mean some people among the developers.
[2015/12/04 15:42:58] <Hume2> Or am I a specialist for that?
[2015/12/04 15:44:30] <Karkus> A specialist at knowing what objects we have?
[2015/12/04 15:44:44] <Hume2> It looks like that.
[2015/12/04 15:45:19] <Hume2> It's really a strange feeling.
[2015/12/04 15:47:15] <Hume2> I know that Tobbi knows many things I don't know.

[2015/12/05 08:34:26] <mt> brmbrmcar: are you still in the internet middle-age where everyone uses silly file upload sites with loads of ads and user tracking? come on. there's pastebins where you can paste plain text stuff (that includes SuperTux levels, worldmaps and most other code) and there's rather serious and well-known image hosts (imgur)
[2015/12/05 08:52:59] <head8debian> Or just use the cloud account that comes with google or amazon.
[2015/12/05 08:55:02] <mt> that'd increse the NSA problem
[2015/12/05 09:07:38] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: I can confirm that level is pretty awful
[2015/12/05 09:46:04] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: Thank you.

[2015/12/05 09:57:15] <head8debian> mt: True, but its really no worse than using these oddball file upload sites which you have absolutely *no* clue of what they do with your data.
[2015/12/05 09:58:01] <head8debian> At least i know what google would do with my data.
[2015/12/05 10:03:00] <mt> well, I like to use https://github.com/sebsauvage/ZeroBin or https://github.com/sametmax/0bin pastebin sites
[2015/12/05 10:03:25] <mt> as the data is stored encrypted in the URL and never (not even in encrypted form) sent to the server
[2015/12/05 10:04:00] <mt> er, the data is well sent to the server
[2015/12/05 10:04:03] <mt> but always encrypted
[2015/12/05 10:04:09] <mt> the key is never sent to the server
[2015/12/05 10:05:11] <head8debian> mt: I use owncloud with my email provider.
[2015/12/05 10:05:23] <head8debian> Well, they use owncloud, so i do. ;)
[2015/12/05 10:05:48] <mt> owncloud doesn't encrypt, I'd only use it via HTTPS and only when hosted on servers I have access to
[2015/12/05 10:06:57] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: Can you finish it?
[2015/12/05 10:06:59] <head8debian> mt: It doesn't encrypt itself, but my email provider encrypts the conection.
[2015/12/05 10:07:11] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Finish what?
[2015/12/05 10:07:37] <head8debian> mt: And i find my email providers TOS decent.
[2015/12/05 10:08:00] <mt> head8debian: and yet I'd not actually trust any external email provider for not doing bullshit
[2015/12/05 10:08:45] <brmbrmcar> The level.
[2015/12/05 10:09:52] <head8debian> mt: True. But im not goign to host my own email.
[2015/12/05 10:09:56] <head8debian> mt: https://www.openmailbox.org/tos
[2015/12/05 10:10:21] <mt> I should switch my mail server to OpenSMTPd at some point
[2015/12/05 10:11:10] <head8debian> They even have a freenode channel.
[2015/12/05 10:11:15] <head8debian> Not a huge one though.
[2015/12/05 10:15:03] <head8debian> mt: But barely any data is private anymore. You would have to encrypt your data on a public hosted VPS for it to be private.
[2015/12/05 10:15:50] <head8debian> What the world is coming to....
[2015/12/05 10:17:28] <mt> choose a provider you trust, use rather safe virtualization (KVM)/get a dedi/host at home/host at a DC you trust and set up an AS yourself, make sure to defend yourself against silly encryption and surveillance laws, then you're fine
[2015/12/05 10:21:29] <head8debian> Yes...
[2015/12/05 10:21:45] <head8debian> THats why i don't take video/pictures of myself and post them all over the interwebs. :D
[2015/12/05 10:43:21] <brmbrmcar> Most pastebins are wayworse than file uploaders.
[2015/12/05 10:44:04] <brmbrmcar> Bigger sites are the worst, because they will modify your files.
[2015/12/05 10:47:59] <mt> encrypted pastebins don't work like that
[2015/12/05 10:48:30] <mt> since if you modify the content something will cryptographically break
[2015/12/05 10:48:33] <brmbrmcar> I use ubuntu pastebin.
[2015/12/05 10:48:51] <brmbrmcar> pastebin.com is adware.
[2015/12/05 10:49:02] <mt> >pastebin.com
[2015/12/05 10:49:41] <brmbrmcar> Yes...
[2015/12/05 10:49:48] <mt> I use gist.github.com (all pastes are git repos <3) or 0bin/zerobin instances (pastes are encrypted <3)
[2015/12/05 10:50:05] <brmbrmcar> I would never use imgur.
[2015/12/05 10:51:06] <mt> why not? seems like a sane solution for me (at least for anything that's not strictly private)
[2015/12/05 10:51:15] <head8debian> Me also.
[2015/12/05 10:52:00] <brmbrmcar> Imgur is full of annoying ads, and a massive company.
[2015/12/05 10:52:04] <brmbrmcar> Use cubeupload
[2015/12/05 10:52:42] <brmbrmcar> And it is almost impossible to link to the actual picture.
[2015/12/05 10:53:29] <mt> >annoying ads >not using adblocker/https://i.imgur.com/${imageid}.${fileextension}
[2015/12/05 10:55:13] <brmbrmcar> I use adblock.
[2015/12/05 10:55:31] <mt> there's also https://ptpb.pw/ (open source), https://uguu.se/ (for large files, also open source) and tons of http://pomf.se/ clones (open source)
[2015/12/05 10:55:52] <head8debian> I don't care about ads too much as long as they dont get in the way of actual use.

[2015/12/05 10:56:16] <brmbrmcar> I will use uguu.se
[2015/12/05 10:56:31] <mt> ads collect your private data more than you'd think
[2015/12/05 10:56:43] <head8debian> And that they don't use flash ads and collect data...

[2015/12/05 10:57:21] <brmbrmcar> Only 24 hours though...
[2015/12/05 11:00:00] <brmbrmcar> I once got Superfish.
[2015/12/05 11:00:08] <brmbrmcar> Worst ads ever.
[2015/12/05 11:01:21] <mt> (why do people use crapware-loaded Windows installs instead of reinstalling clean)
[2015/12/05 11:02:01] <brmbrmcar> I had Superfish on Chrome OS.
[2015/12/05 11:02:18] <brmbrmcar> I deleted it quickly.
[2015/12/05 11:03:54] <brmbrmcar> If it was Windows it would still be there...
[2015/12/05 11:12:55] <head8debian> mt: I feel the same way as you, but i don't want to buy a OEM copy of windows and a licence key on top of the cost of a new computer. At least i can delete the junk-ware, but it leaves crud on my system.
[2015/12/05 11:15:18] <mt> just need to get the ISO from MS and enter your license key to reinstall
[2015/12/05 11:15:57] <mt> OEM keys won't work without OEM ISOs, but anything that ships with OEM software nowadays stores the license key in the hardware (UEFI)
[2015/12/05 11:16:28] <head8debian> I didn't know that.
[2015/12/05 11:16:34] <mt> which means that you can reinstall from the MS ISO without having to enter any key
[2015/12/05 11:16:39] <head8debian> SO no more external product keys?
[2015/12/05 11:16:40] <head8debian> COol.
[2015/12/05 11:17:10] <head8debian> I havent touched anything new in a while.
[2015/12/05 11:17:33] <mt> Well, I guess it's stored in the UEFI as that's the only thing that can store custom data w/o having to add a new internal device ;)
[2015/12/05 11:21:12] <head8debian> TWrue.
[2015/12/05 11:21:14] <head8debian> True*
[2015/12/05 11:29:05] <brmbrmcar> You want Windows?
[2015/12/05 11:30:30] <brmbrmcar> I don't understand how you can criticise me for my lack of security when you guys run Windows.

[2015/12/05 11:49:51] <Tobbi> hello...
[2015/12/05 11:50:04] <Tobbi> I know...the pastebin fun talk is over, now that I am here.
[2015/12/05 11:50:09] <Tobbi> We Germans don't understand fun.
[2015/12/05 11:50:10] <Tobbi> Never.
[2015/12/05 11:51:13] <brmbrmcar> Thanks for ending!
[2015/12/05 11:55:12] <head8debian> Good greif. :/
[2015/12/05 11:55:20] <Tobbi> Actually, now that I think about it: You may continue...
[2015/12/05 11:55:26] <Tobbi> Now that brmbrmcar is annoyed by it.
[2015/12/05 11:56:30] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2015/12/05 11:57:25] <head8debian> Anyways...
[2015/12/05 12:00:10] <brmbrmcar> You think Windows isfine, and yet you scream at me for getting a Chromebook. Are you insane?

[2015/12/05 12:05:27] <head8debian> Tobbi: o_O
[2015/12/05 12:05:43] <Tobbi> head8debian: FINALLY!
[2015/12/05 12:05:46] <Tobbi> god damn it.
[2015/12/05 12:06:08] <Tobbi> But, hey, this guy reads the logs so he will get back here...
[2015/12/05 12:14:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: FINALY what?
[2015/12/05 12:14:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Finally this guy left.
[2015/12/05 12:14:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/12/05 12:15:12] <mt> you can also prevent a join!
[2015/12/05 12:15:25] <Tobbi> mt: By banning him... :P
[2015/12/05 12:15:29] <Tobbi> yeah, I know.
[2015/12/05 12:15:34] <mt> yeah
[2015/12/05 12:15:46] <mt> or at least hmm...
[2015/12/05 12:15:49] <Tobbi> But this is a friendly channel... I don't ban people until they get severly on my nerves...
[2015/12/05 12:15:56] <mt> yeah
[2015/12/05 12:15:57] <Tobbi> Actually, wait  amoment.
[2015/12/05 12:16:00] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/05 12:16:32] <Tobbi> mt: Is it justified that I ban him?
[2015/12/05 12:16:46] <mt> a (insert the not +b but almost +b mode) could at least make him wonder what's happened :>
[2015/12/05 12:17:20] <Tobbi> mt: I don't want him to wonder. For all I know, him wondering leads to his annoying behaviour.
[2015/12/05 12:17:21] <mt> dunno, your decision
[2015/12/05 12:17:53] <Tobbi> I will ban him the next time he gets on my nerves.
[2015/12/05 12:18:20] <mt> for me, annoying behavior can be a reason to justify a ban if it continues to be a problem after telling the user to stop
[2015/12/05 12:18:29] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/12/05 12:18:36] <Tobbi> It won't be long before he tries it again.
[2015/12/05 12:18:49] <Tobbi> I just don't have time or nerves to deal with people like him.

[2015/12/05 15:29:04] <head8debian> Good afternoon Tobbi.
[2015/12/05 15:29:37] <Tobbi> hello head8debian
[2015/12/05 15:29:45] <Tobbi> Did anything interesting happen while I was away?
[2015/12/05 15:30:13] <head8debian> Tobbi: Nope, except all my computers shut off randomly and my brother runs up to me telling me that the comptuer froze...
[2015/12/05 15:30:29] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay...
[2015/12/05 15:31:07] <head8debian> I think my brother hit the power switch.
[2015/12/05 15:31:15] <head8debian> With his toe.

[2015/12/05 18:37:53] @ tux|dude joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/05 18:53:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: Morning?
[2015/12/05 18:54:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: In some place in this world, it is morning.
[2015/12/05 18:54:22] <Tobbi> Always think about that.
[2015/12/05 18:54:52] <Karkus> But for me it isn't, and I don't think it is for you either
[2015/12/05 18:56:35] <Karkus> Interestingly, nowhere in the world is June a summer month.
[2015/12/05 19:09:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: According to SuperTux, it is officially Christmas time now
[2015/12/05 19:09:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: Indeed ;)
[2015/12/05 19:09:58] <Karkus> Is 6th of December an important date?
[2015/12/05 19:11:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: Saint Nicholas day?
[2015/12/05 19:11:36] <Tobbi> Whatever Nikolaustag is in English.
[2015/12/05 19:12:28] <Karkus> Seems to be so. I don't know much about these festivities.
[2015/12/05 19:12:51] <Karkus> Also, the main menu level is annoying me now. Tux walks into walls too many times
[2015/12/05 19:14:59] @ Quit: leyyin: Quit: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
[2015/12/05 19:25:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: Tux walks into walls?
[2015/12/05 19:26:02] <Tobbi> That shouldn't happen.
[2015/12/05 19:26:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: He bumps into them as he's jumping up the steps
[2015/12/05 19:26:28] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2015/12/05 19:26:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: But he still advances right?
[2015/12/05 19:26:43] <Karkus> Yeah
[2015/12/05 19:27:02] <Tobbi> Karkus: If it matters, change the lookahead stuff in that file which I can't remember the name of...
[2015/12/05 19:27:06] <Tobbi> And I'm too lazy to look it up.
[2015/12/05 19:27:46] <Karkus> Tobbi: I've looked at it before, let me see if I can find it
[2015/12/05 19:32:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: Also, when M2 is complete, will we have to change the executable name to supertux3?
[2015/12/05 19:32:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: Never thought about that before.
[2015/12/05 19:32:28] <Tobbi> We might need to.
[2015/12/05 19:32:29] <Karkus> (and everything else e.g ~/.supertux3)
[2015/12/05 19:32:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: But might be a lot of work.
[2015/12/05 19:32:39] <Karkus> could mess things up big time
[2015/12/05 19:32:55] <Tobbi> I intend to take a longer break after the release.
[2015/12/05 19:33:06] <Karkus> Okay :)
[2015/12/05 19:33:30] <Tobbi> I helped you guys with the release, it's fine. If you guys want to continue...well, you don't depend on me, you all have access rights etc.
[2015/12/05 19:33:48] <Karkus> We will, of course
[2015/12/05 19:34:45] <Tobbi> great. :-)
[2015/12/05 19:35:11] <Tobbi> My life is strange...
[2015/12/05 19:35:20] <Tobbi> but what's normal anyway.
[2015/12/05 19:35:25] <Karkus> And, of course, when you come back to check up on us, there will be 10 worlds and it will be M5
[2015/12/05 19:35:57] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/12/05 19:36:06] <Karkus> D:
[2015/12/05 19:36:42] <Karkus> I guess that'll mean you unsubscribe from all the github emails and the mailing list then?
[2015/12/05 19:37:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, that means I need to take a longer break to reflect on my life, my achievements and my abilities.
[2015/12/05 19:37:30] <Tobbi> It was quite overdue...
[2015/12/05 19:38:04] <Tobbi> *is
[2015/12/05 19:39:42] <Karkus> Yeah, it's fine

[2015/12/06 10:02:32] <Tobbi> head8debian: Mine as well... oh, wait, that wasn't an innuendo.
[2015/12/06 10:04:27] <mt> I guess now that we have a 0.4.1 milestone in github we can rename Post-0.4.0 to 0.5.0?
[2015/12/06 10:04:37] <Tobbi> possibly?
[2015/12/06 10:04:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Can you raise your IQ by eating gifted children? :P
[2015/12/06 10:05:04] <Hume2> :D
[2015/12/06 10:05:44] <Hume2> I'll just add a paralax background to Bonus Level, it will be fast.

[2015/12/06 10:35:09] <Hume2> Hello, brmbrmcar.

[2015/12/06 10:43:25] <Tobbi> Bulgarian is at 97%.
[2015/12/06 10:44:14] <Hume2> Is there a level that hasn't paralax background so far? (and isn't in addon)
[2015/12/06 10:44:35] <Hume2> (...and can have)

[2015/12/06 10:48:46] <Hume2> :D I guess that all levels those had arctic.jpg have now paralaz background.
[2015/12/06 10:49:09] <Hume2> Wait, menu level doesn't have so far!

[2015/12/06 10:54:02] <mt> what does the earth bonus actually do?
[2015/12/06 10:55:23] <brmbrmcar> mt:give Tux a light.
[2015/12/06 10:55:27] <Hume2> Press ctrl+down to become invincible for a moment.
[2015/12/06 10:56:12] <Tobbi> Hume2: The christmas hat someone slides across tux's head sometimes...can you fix that? I am too lazy to do so :P
[2015/12/06 10:56:28] <Tobbi> Aka, it doesn't feel like it's in complete sync with Tux's hat.
[2015/12/06 10:57:02] <Hume2> Tobbi: I noticed that, but I think that it's intended.
[2015/12/06 10:57:06] <Tobbi> Hume2: I was the one doing this change.
[2015/12/06 10:57:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: Actually, keep it.
[2015/12/06 10:57:20] <Tobbi> If you think it's intended, others will think so as well :D
[2015/12/06 10:58:57] <Hume2> :D
[2015/12/06 11:03:05] <brmbrmcar> I never noticed the earth hat invincibility.
[2015/12/06 11:03:23] <brmbrmcar> Whenever in the game it is used, it should be explained.
[2015/12/06 11:05:19] <Hume2> It's not used anywhere so far.
[2015/12/06 11:05:57] <Hume2> There was an idea that there could be a shop somewhere.
[2015/12/06 11:06:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: LMH's island uses it.
[2015/12/06 11:06:28] <Hume2> Tobbi: I haven't noticed, let me check.

[2015/12/06 11:07:22] <brmbrmcar> I think air flower should not be in the shop.
[2015/12/06 11:07:34] <brmbrmcar> It has several problems.
[2015/12/06 11:08:24] <brmbrmcar> My incredibly bad forest levelI recently made has it...
[2015/12/06 11:09:29] <Hume2> In my opinion, the air and earth flowers fit to the shop perfectly.

[2015/12/06 11:09:45] <giby> Hi
[2015/12/06 11:10:06] <Hume2> Hello, Giby.
[2015/12/06 11:10:09] <giby> Tobbi, are you the one adding people on Transfix?
[2015/12/06 11:10:15] <Tobbi> giby: Yup.
[2015/12/06 11:10:17] <giby> Hi Hume2 :)
[2015/12/06 11:10:28] <Tobbi> giby: I figured we need as many people as possible so shortly before the release.
[2015/12/06 11:10:44] <Tobbi> Sorry if I overstepped my duties.
[2015/12/06 11:10:45] <giby> Tobbi, Oh.... Noooooo....
[2015/12/06 11:10:54] <Tobbi> giby: So far it's been fine.
[2015/12/06 11:11:00] <Tobbi> giby: I checked translations randomly.
[2015/12/06 11:11:05] <Tobbi> With Google translat.
[2015/12/06 11:11:06] <Tobbi> e
[2015/12/06 11:11:33] <giby> You can add whoever... but first you should have ask them to introduce themselves...
[2015/12/06 11:11:42] <Karkus> maths22: On http://brlcad.org/~maths22/supertux-download.php, why are they called 0.3.5?
[2015/12/06 11:11:53] <brmbrmcar> 0.3.5-git
[2015/12/06 11:11:57] <giby> Just to avoid few issues
[2015/12/06 11:12:08] <brmbrmcar> It is the normal name for git stuff.
[2015/12/06 11:12:32] <Karkus> But aren't we working towards 0.4.0 at this point
[2015/12/06 11:12:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: "git describe" uses the latest git tag available.
[2015/12/06 11:12:46] <Tobbi> Which at this point is 0.3.5
[2015/12/06 11:12:53] <Karkus> Ah
[2015/12/06 11:13:14] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/06 11:13:24] <Tobbi> giby: Actually, I also checked whether they are part of a group for a different open source project...and add these more easily.
[2015/12/06 11:13:45] <Tobbi> Because if they also translate another open source project, we can assume others accept their contributions as well.
[2015/12/06 11:13:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: I haven
[2015/12/06 11:14:04] <Tobbi> 't changed strings on transifex in about a week
[2015/12/06 11:14:07] <Tobbi> Despite string freeze.
[2015/12/06 11:14:11] <Tobbi> Something is clearly wrong.
[2015/12/06 11:14:29] <Tobbi> Someone could assume I go by what I say now.
[2015/12/06 11:14:52] <Tobbi> So maybe we should change one more string to convince people I am completely unreliable.
[2015/12/06 11:14:53] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/06 11:15:22] <Hume2> Plus there are a few new strings in incubator. :P
[2015/12/06 11:15:36] <brmbrmcar> I have also noticed with the earth flower that both control and action keys work.
[2015/12/06 11:15:47] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yeah, but, no. Leave these...
[2015/12/06 11:15:50] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/06 11:16:01] <Hume2> ...untranslated?
[2015/12/06 11:16:03] <Karkus> :D I also noticed German and Czech are the two fully translated languages... I wonder wht
[2015/12/06 11:16:07] <Karkus> *why
[2015/12/06 11:16:16] <Tobbi> Karkus: Because I am the one translating those strings, and Hume is.
[2015/12/06 11:16:16] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/06 11:16:26] <Tobbi> So, naturally we make sure we get them updated asap.
[2015/12/06 11:16:33] <Hume2> Exactly. And because of Narre.
[2015/12/06 11:16:40] <Tobbi> giby: Let me ask how the stk guys handle transifex contributors.
[2015/12/06 11:16:41] <Karkus> I'm kidding :P
[2015/12/06 11:16:44] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/06 11:16:47] <Tobbi> Ah, I see.
[2015/12/06 11:16:56] <Karkus> Also, how updated are the nightly builds?
[2015/12/06 11:17:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: Would you know how stk handles transifex contributors? Do you ask people to introduce themselves?
[2015/12/06 11:18:30] <Tobbi> Karkus: windows builds are fairly recent (only 5 commits behind)
[2015/12/06 11:18:31] <leyyin> idk
[2015/12/06 11:18:39] <Tobbi> leyyin: who does?
[2015/12/06 11:18:46] <leyyin> yes, themselfs
[2015/12/06 11:19:00] <leyyin> if you want to be a contributor to a language we add you for that language
[2015/12/06 11:19:09] <leyyin> on transifex
[2015/12/06 11:19:09] * Tobbi checks mac builds.
[2015/12/06 11:19:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: Are they just updated whenever maths22 triggers a build?
[2015/12/06 11:19:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe automatically, more or less.
[2015/12/06 11:19:30] <Tobbi> Unless people add [ci skip]
[2015/12/06 11:20:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: Last 5 commits were [ci skip].
[2015/12/06 11:20:10] <Tobbi> So, the windows build is recent.
[2015/12/06 11:20:51] <Karkus> There's about twenty different links though, is it the top one?
[2015/12/06 11:21:22] <Karkus> (windows)
[2015/12/06 11:21:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes. The higher the number the more recent.
[2015/12/06 11:21:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: Right. I'm going to boot into windows to test it out
[2015/12/06 11:22:01] @ Quit: Karkus: Quit: Division By Zero
[2015/12/06 11:22:23] <brmbrmcar> Does it work with all Windows now?
[2015/12/06 11:22:35] <brmbrmcar> I want to run it off Wine.
[2015/12/06 11:22:50] <Tobbi> Latest build for mac is from 17 days ago.
[2015/12/06 11:23:00] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I doubt wine works. There's still this bug report.
[2015/12/06 11:23:07] <Hume2> If it didn't work on Windows 10, it wouldn't really mind me.
[2015/12/06 11:23:17] <Tobbi> Not again!
[2015/12/06 11:23:18] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/06 11:23:29] <brmbrmcar> It only works on Windows 10.
[2015/12/06 11:23:43] <Hume2> What went wrong???
[2015/12/06 11:24:10] <brmbrmcar> With what???
[2015/12/06 11:24:43] <Hume2> You know, the "works only on Windows 10" thing.
[2015/12/06 11:25:22] <brmbrmcar> Well, I have noidea.
[2015/12/06 11:25:30] <brmbrmcar> I didn't build it.
[2015/12/06 11:25:54] <Tobbi> giby: When do you update the translations from transifex?
[2015/12/06 11:26:07] <Hume2> At least there's a chance that Microsoft will get rid of spying you when you play SuperTux.
[2015/12/06 11:26:08] <Tobbi> I'm not pushing just asking. :)
[2015/12/06 11:26:41] <brmbrmcar> I was forced to use Windows 10 on  Friday.
[2015/12/06 11:27:14] <Hume2> Who has forced you?
[2015/12/06 11:27:37] <brmbrmcar> My parents.
[2015/12/06 11:27:55] <Hume2> That's not good.
[2015/12/06 11:27:57] <brmbrmcar> They wanted to see whether video editing was any faster.
[2015/12/06 11:28:15] <brmbrmcar> Onstupid software they actually paid for.
[2015/12/06 11:28:33] <Hume2> :D And was it faster? Guess no.
[2015/12/06 11:29:14] <Hume2> Maybe it was faster, but only until Windows will mess up the registry.
[2015/12/06 11:29:16] <brmbrmcar> Well, itwas a computer upgrade...
[2015/12/06 11:29:18] <giby> Hume2, I don't care about MS spying on me... I'm under watch by intelligence service, that is worse
[2015/12/06 11:29:47] <Hume2> Giby, at least they are not interrested of your personal data.
[2015/12/06 11:30:07] <Tobbi> giby: Why are you?
[2015/12/06 11:30:10] <giby> they got them
[2015/12/06 11:30:39] <giby> I live in a socialist dictature.... You know, France....
[2015/12/06 11:30:51] <Tobbi> right.
[2015/12/06 11:30:54] <Tobbi> Okay, right.
[2015/12/06 11:31:33] <Hume2> I mean they aren't interrested in your PIN of your credit card.
[2015/12/06 11:31:34] <giby> even If I haven't ran for election this year, they still watch me
[2015/12/06 11:31:56] <giby> Hume2, they get better ways to get my money

[2015/12/06 11:38:11] <mt> I think the packages were too old
[2015/12/06 11:38:20] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Agreed.

[2015/12/06 11:39:32] <Karkus_On_Windos> The nightly builds aren't working for me, do you need to install SDL?
[2015/12/06 11:39:56] <Tobbi> Karkus_On_Windos: Normally, that should be included.
[2015/12/06 11:40:05] <Tobbi> maths22: ^^

[2015/12/06 11:41:11] <Tobbi> fine.
[2015/12/06 11:41:15] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/12/06 11:42:36] <mt> even with trusty based ubuntu cmake will still be too old
[2015/12/06 11:43:15] <brmbrmcar> I tried to build supertux on Ubuntu, same old error.
[2015/12/06 11:45:12] <mt> what ubuntu release?
[2015/12/06 11:45:12] <Karkus_On_Windos> Tobbi: I ran it from the terminal, and now it works fine. Maybe something to do with the Start Menu link?
[2015/12/06 11:45:20] <Tobbi> Karkus_On_Windos: Perhaps?
[2015/12/06 11:45:37] <mt> a recent ubuntu (vivid, wily) should work fine
[2015/12/06 11:45:44] <Tobbi> Karkus_On_Windos: What does it point to?
[2015/12/06 11:46:16] <Karkus_On_Windos> Tobbi: No, it's not that... If the game loses focus, it goes blank.
[2015/12/06 11:46:23] <brmbrmcar> mt: I can only get lts.
[2015/12/06 11:46:31] <Tobbi> That is weird.
[2015/12/06 11:46:42] <mt> brmbrmcar: there's your problem
[2015/12/06 11:46:55] <brmbrmcar> mt: But why?
[2015/12/06 11:46:57] <Karkus_On_Windos> maths22 said he'd tested it. I will need to speak to him about this
[2015/12/06 11:47:14] <Karkus_On_Windos> Unless anyone else can test it?
[2015/12/06 11:47:19] <mt> brmbrmcar: because the package versions are too old
[2015/12/06 11:47:33] <brmbrmcar> I have the error about glew thingy
[2015/12/06 11:47:37] <mt> we require cmake 3+ (iirc), sdl2, sdl2_image
[2015/12/06 11:48:10] <mt> trusty ships cmake 2.8 but includes sdl2*, precise doesn't ship any of these releases
[2015/12/06 11:48:14] <brmbrmcar> I have all them.
[2015/12/06 11:49:07] <Tobbi> yup, travis docker builds don't include sdl2.
[2015/12/06 11:49:27] <mt> and, the bigger problem, cmake
[2015/12/06 11:50:07] <mt> since we broke compatibility with cmake 2.x for some reason
[2015/12/06 11:50:23] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/12/06 11:50:26] <mt> and that's what precise and trusty ship
[2015/12/06 11:50:42] <Tobbi> Let's hold off on docker based infrastructure for now.
[2015/12/06 11:50:54] <Tobbi> this is an absolute nightmare in so many ways.
[2015/12/06 11:51:06] <brmbrmcar> Does cmake 2.x get past the finding stuff stage?
[2015/12/06 11:51:35] <mt> I don't think so; and there's a reason behind dropping 2.x support
[2015/12/06 11:53:27] <brmbrmcar> SoI have cmake 3?
[2015/12/06 11:55:08] <mt> if you're trying to build and it works, yep
[2015/12/06 11:55:36] <mt> we're talking about building right now, not about the nightlies, if you haven't realized
[2015/12/06 11:55:43] <brmbrmcar> Ihave an error with the gkew stuff.

[2015/12/06 11:57:33] <brmbrmcar> even setting depth to 1 turns intomassive space.
[2015/12/06 11:58:10] <Tobbi> I'd really like to know why glbinding won't build.

[2015/12/06 12:20:08] <maths22> Karkus: yes. It builds using Visual Studio 2015, so I need to include some more redistributiles
[2015/12/06 12:20:35] <Karkus> maths22: Okay, great
[2015/12/06 12:20:36] <maths22> Karkus: Numbering is now based on 'git describe', hence the 0.3.5
[2015/12/06 12:22:08] @ Hume2 left channel #supertux ()
[2015/12/06 12:22:39] <mt> for further: explanation git describe refers to v0.3.5 and not v0.3.5a because the latter is tagged in release/0.3.5, but not in master
[2015/12/06 12:22:51] <Tobbi> hah, nice.
[2015/12/06 12:23:14] <Tobbi> We should change that as well...

[2015/12/06 12:27:22] <Tobbi> It fails because of unshallow.

[2015/12/06 12:30:33] <Tobbi> I mean: It finds glbinding and builds with it.
[2015/12/06 12:30:35] <Tobbi> afaics.
[2015/12/06 12:30:47] <maths22> Tobbi: That is good
[2015/12/06 12:30:52] <mt> I wonder if we can somehow link the CI checks to the OBS nightlies instead of relying on our broken Travis setup

[2015/12/06 12:31:35] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/06 12:31:35] <mt> well currently we build cmake, sdl2 and sdl2-image on travis manually
[2015/12/06 12:31:43] <maths22> mt: That will change tonight
[2015/12/06 12:31:59] <maths22> Also, only the OS X nightlies use travis
[2015/12/06 12:32:02] <mt> upgrading to travis' trusty will still need cmake builds since trusty is still using cmake 2.x
[2015/12/06 12:32:14] <maths22> mt: I actually don't need that new of a cmake

[2015/12/06 12:33:14] <mt> which provides sdl2
[2015/12/06 12:33:22] <mt> but not cmake 3

[2015/12/06 12:33:33] <Tobbi> I see!
[2015/12/06 12:34:07] <Tobbi> mt: So, if that's migrated, we can switch to docker builds?
[2015/12/06 12:34:11] <Tobbi> *once
[2015/12/06 12:34:13] <mt> no
[2015/12/06 12:34:26] <Tobbi> Hrm, okay.
[2015/12/06 12:34:27] <mt> dist: trusty is Google Cloud Engine w/o docker only
[2015/12/06 12:34:55] <Tobbi> Guys, do we switch over to using glbinding instead of glew? According to them, they have a better CXX11 API...
[2015/12/06 12:35:44] <mt> what about glbinding availabilty in popular distros?
[2015/12/06 12:36:24] <mt> if it's not available everywhere we should announce the switch one 0.y.0 before the actual release, imho
[2015/12/06 12:37:40] <maths22> mt: It actually uses https://launchpad.net/~george-edison55/+archive/ubuntu/cmake-3.x for cmake
[2015/12/06 12:38:05] <mt> glbinding is not in debian sid, ubuntu xenial, arch, gentoo
[2015/12/06 12:38:17] <mt> haven't checked rpm-based distros
[2015/12/06 12:38:31] <mt> maths22: ah, then at least dist: trusty will work
[2015/12/06 12:38:56] <mt> there's sadly no cmake 3.x ppa allowed for docker-based builds
[2015/12/06 12:39:10] <maths22> mt: What are these docker-based builds of which we week?
[2015/12/06 12:39:14] <maths22> s/week/speak/
[2015/12/06 12:39:14] <red_bot> maths22 meant: "mt: What are these docker-based builds of which we speak?"
[2015/12/06 12:39:32] <mt> Travis' docker build infrastructure
[2015/12/06 12:39:39] <Tobbi> mt: Okay, but at least having the ability to use glbinding is good.
[2015/12/06 12:40:46] <maths22> mt: That is correct.  trusty currently doesn't support the docker-based builds
[2015/12/06 12:41:03] <Tobbi> maths22: I wonder: Why did the build just fail now because of --unshallow? It worked the days before today...
[2015/12/06 12:41:12] <Tobbi> Did anything change?
[2015/12/06 12:41:43] <maths22> However, it has an 'apt' plugin that installs apt packges from a list of approved repositories without using sudo
[2015/12/06 12:42:10] <mt> I know, but there's no obvious repo name that suggests there are cmake 3.x packages available
[2015/12/06 12:42:10] <maths22> mt: see https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/travis/.travis.yml
[2015/12/06 12:42:28] <maths22> mt: and see https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-cookbooks/blob/master/cookbooks/travis_cmake/recipes/default.rb
[2015/12/06 12:43:31] <mt> btw, I had https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/feature/travis-ci-docker-builds/.travis.yml
[2015/12/06 12:44:04] <mt> but yeah, it failed because cmake isn't available and I also didn't want to mix in debian-sid for sdl2
[2015/12/06 12:44:08] <maths22> mt: OK.  That makes sense
[2015/12/06 12:44:35] <maths22> Mine does most of the same things
[2015/12/06 12:44:44] <mt> main problem: it preferred to download everything from debian sid but that wasn't cached on travis infrastructure
[2015/12/06 12:45:07] <mt> while the precise packages, are iirc, cached
[2015/12/06 12:45:20] <mt> feel free to delete the branch
[2015/12/06 12:46:22] <mt> Tobbi: maybe we should switch the default to glbinding and for the 0.4.0 release put up a big bold text telling package managers to consider to switch to glbinding?
[2015/12/06 12:46:54] <Tobbi> mt: We could certainly do that...
[2015/12/06 12:47:02] <Tobbi> But I still expect an uproar by them.
[2015/12/06 12:47:09] <Tobbi> GLEW is what they're used to.
[2015/12/06 12:47:55] <mt> packaging glbinding shouldn't be a big problem, and toggling a cmake switch to use GLEW should be even less of a problem
[2015/12/06 12:48:16] <mt> and that way they'll have time before we drop GLEW support
[2015/12/06 12:48:22] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/12/06 12:48:26] <Tobbi> Do we even want to drop it?
[2015/12/06 12:48:32] <Tobbi> I say we keep it.
[2015/12/06 12:49:11] <Tobbi> maths22: Why did the build we did half an hour ago fail due to --unshallow? I can remember --unshallow working before that...I still don't understand that issue.
[2015/12/06 12:50:09] <Tobbi> I might be stupid :D
[2015/12/06 12:51:25] <maths22> I don't know why... taking a look now
[2015/12/06 12:51:42] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/12/06 12:53:04] <maths22> Tobbi: I still have no idea
[2015/12/06 12:53:09] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/12/06 12:53:23] <Tobbi> This is totally weird...
[2015/12/06 12:54:17] <maths22> Tobbi: I assumed it must be an old git version, but if it used to work, it should still work (unless something went wrong on the travis end)
[2015/12/06 12:54:27] <Tobbi> I might ask in #travis
[2015/12/06 12:55:06] <Tobbi> maths22: When did you add --unshallow? Not too long ago, right?
[2015/12/06 12:55:56] <maths22> Tobbi: december 1
[2015/12/06 12:56:13] <Tobbi> We had successful builds since then, iirc.
[2015/12/06 12:56:34] <maths22> Tobbi: that is correct
[2015/12/06 12:58:27] <maths22> mt: Once I have OS X and windows happy, I'll fix up the OBS builds for linux
[2015/12/06 12:58:37] <Tobbi> maths22: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/4942
[2015/12/06 12:58:43] <Tobbi> Maybe we should just make another commit.
[2015/12/06 13:00:49] <Tobbi> I will add that option they talk about.
[2015/12/06 13:01:12] <maths22> Tobbi: see
[2015/12/06 13:01:13] <maths22> This seems to be happening reliably on the migrated new-infra precise workers
[2015/12/06 13:01:21] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/12/06 13:01:29] <maths22> Tobbi: Don't worry about that, since we are switching to trusty tonight
[2015/12/06 13:01:39] <Tobbi> okay, then, let's wait.
[2015/12/06 13:01:57] <maths22> Tobbi: I just need to finish up fixing silly OS X errors, and then I will merge
[2015/12/06 13:02:04] <Tobbi> alright!
[2015/12/06 13:02:21] <Tobbi> I just hope that glbinding building is fixed for good.

[2015/12/07 08:26:29] <head8debian> Good morning Tobbi.
[2015/12/07 08:26:38] <Tobbi> hello head8debian
[2015/12/07 08:26:46] <head8debian> Is there anything i can do today for ST thats small? :)
[2015/12/07 08:29:54] <maths22> Tobbi: That is not actually the right change
[2015/12/07 08:30:08] <Tobbi> maths22: Oh, right. I am not informed, anyway.
[2015/12/07 08:30:43] <maths22> Tobbi: It needs to actually be startup.sh
[2015/12/07 08:31:35] <maths22> Tobbi: You were actually right.  I misremembered; sorry

[2015/12/07 08:50:17] <Tobbi> Sure, thanks.
[2015/12/07 08:50:37] <Tobbi> maths22: It seems like you're the one in the team doing most of the work. I'm quite sorry for that.

[2015/12/07 11:07:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: It doesn't fit for a C64.
[2015/12/07 11:07:20] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: What broke on your ubuntu install>
[2015/12/07 11:07:21] <head8debian> ?
[2015/12/07 11:07:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: What?
[2015/12/07 11:07:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: A C64 is an old computer.
[2015/12/07 11:07:40] <maths22> Tobbi: OK.  I'll look into it later
[2015/12/07 11:08:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ah, the comadore. :D
[2015/12/07 11:08:18] <head8debian> Tobbi: My PC is not that old.
[2015/12/07 11:08:22] <Tobbi> head8debian: Exactly. Also, it's Commodore. You don't get comatose.
[2015/12/07 11:08:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its only 5 years old.
[2015/12/07 11:08:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: Still older than brmbrmcar.
[2015/12/07 11:08:49] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: One of my configuration files.
[2015/12/07 11:09:15] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Ah.
[2015/12/07 11:09:24] <brmbrmcar> It deleted the taskbar and thing at top.
[2015/12/07 11:09:29] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Thought you broke Xorg or something. :D
[2015/12/07 11:09:30] <maths22> Tobbi: I'm thinking about getting the domain supertuxproject.org so we can have things hosted propertly (for these builds and such)
[2015/12/07 11:09:31] <head8debian> Heh.
[2015/12/07 11:09:37] <maths22> How does that sound?
[2015/12/07 11:09:43] <Tobbi> maths22: That would be great!
[2015/12/07 11:09:46] <head8debian> maths22: If you want to pay for it, sure.
[2015/12/07 11:09:59] <maths22> (Sadly supertux.org is taken and for sale for some ridiculous amount of money)
[2015/12/07 11:10:04] <head8debian> We don't have a full-fledged server ATM.
[2015/12/07 11:10:07] <brmbrmcar> I had to reinstall twice, as first time I copied over the bad file.
[2015/12/07 11:10:10] <maths22> head8debian: It's like 10 dollars for a year
[2015/12/07 11:10:26] <head8debian> maths22: What does it have for resources?
[2015/12/07 11:10:30] <maths22> I can do that.  (And I have a server to point to as necessary)
[2015/12/07 11:10:49] <Tobbi> Some German guy hosted it.
[2015/12/07 11:10:57] <maths22> head8debian: the 10 dollars is for the domain
[2015/12/07 11:11:07] <head8debian> Ah, i see.
[2015/12/07 11:11:27] <head8debian> I thought you wanted to buy a server and a domain. :)
[2015/12/07 11:11:28] <maths22> The server is run by the BRL-CAD organization (more or less) for open source projects to use
[2015/12/07 11:11:32] <head8debian> Anyways, cool.
[2015/12/07 11:11:33] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/12/07 11:11:45] <Tobbi> yay, anyone have 395 USD ready?
[2015/12/07 11:11:50] <Tobbi> Now we could use donations.
[2015/12/07 11:11:52] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/07 11:11:55] <head8debian> :D
[2015/12/07 11:12:14] <maths22> Tobbi: That's what I was thinking :)  supertuxproject is so much cheaper
[2015/12/07 11:12:16] <leyyin> run with the money :P
[2015/12/07 11:12:33] <Tobbi> leyyin: Eventually I intend to just keep the money all by myself, you know me.
[2015/12/07 11:12:35] <head8debian> supertux.org would be so cool though. :)
[2015/12/07 11:12:52] <head8debian> Oh well.
[2015/12/07 11:13:11] <Tobbi> leyyin: And afterwards, I will say something along the lines "No one has an intention of keeping donations"
[2015/12/07 11:13:34] <maths22> head8debian: I know.  And it is just owned by some domain squatter
[2015/12/07 11:13:54] <maths22> At least supertux.com/supertux.net are owned by some guy in California, who seems to basically own them for his own purposes
[2015/12/07 11:14:03] <head8debian> maths22: I hate those. They steal alot of good domains.
[2015/12/07 11:14:04] <maths22> (And has had at least supertux.com since 2000!)
[2015/12/07 11:14:20] <Tobbi> supertux.com is great. Just "test"
[2015/12/07 11:14:32] <head8debian> maths22: Wow, thats a long time.
[2015/12/07 11:14:45] <maths22> Tobbi: I know!
[2015/12/07 11:15:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: They do it because they might think we will eventually agree to their high demands.
[2015/12/07 11:15:04] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/07 11:15:16] <Tobbi> With all that money we make from SuperTux.
[2015/12/07 11:15:17] <Tobbi> You know :D
[2015/12/07 11:15:48] <head8debian> Yeah. :D
[2015/12/07 11:16:27] <brmbrmcar> How much money does Supertux actually make?
[2015/12/07 11:16:59] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: In case you didn't notice...That was sarcasm.
[2015/12/07 11:17:22] <brmbrmcar> Nothing?
[2015/12/07 11:18:19] <brmbrmcar> Any donations at all?
[2015/12/07 11:18:21] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How would we potentially earn money? Ingame ads?
[2015/12/07 11:18:22] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/07 11:18:32] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Do you see a donation button on the website or in the game?
[2015/12/07 11:18:52] <brmbrmcar> It says about wanting to pay for SuperTux.
[2015/12/07 11:20:04] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: where does it say so?
[2015/12/07 11:21:27] <brmbrmcar> In the wiki below some pages. I'll send you a link...
[2015/12/07 11:21:38] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: We are a open source game, we don't require money donations. The only reason we would ever need money is to pay to host a server.

[2015/12/07 11:24:28] <head8debian> maths22: We could pay for a domain if we did this. :)
[2015/12/07 11:24:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: My thinking exactly.
[2015/12/07 11:25:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: And you could buy a goat with it. :p
[2015/12/07 11:25:30] <Tobbi> head8debian: And let it live in my garden.
[2015/12/07 11:25:35] <Tobbi> My neighbours will be pleased.

[2015/12/07 11:27:58] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/12/07 11:28:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: You know, I left my xmas lights out the whole year just to annoy them. A goat in the garden might be a new low.
[2015/12/07 11:29:33] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do we need a proper bank account if we were to accept donations?

[2015/12/07 11:48:34] <Tobbi> Now that this domain was bought.. :P
[2015/12/07 11:49:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, who bought it?
[2015/12/07 11:49:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: maths22 did.
[2015/12/07 11:49:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: We are looking into accepting donations so that we can eventually buy supertux.org
[2015/12/07 11:49:25] <brmbrmcar> How many email adresses are allowed on there?
[2015/12/07 11:49:29] <Karkus> maths22: Wow, that's great!
[2015/12/07 11:49:38] <head8debian> maths22: "D
[2015/12/07 11:49:41] <head8debian> :*
[2015/12/07 11:50:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Sounds good. We would need to partner with something like SPI or Copyleft Games etc. to manage donations though, I reckon
[2015/12/07 11:50:34] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Its infinite.
[2015/12/07 11:50:43] <Tobbi> Ah...What I was thinking.
[2015/12/07 11:50:48] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2015/12/07 11:51:09] <brmbrmcar> But they steal some of the money!
[2015/12/07 11:51:30] <Karkus> Inevitably
[2015/12/07 11:52:25] <brmbrmcar> We do not want that.
[2015/12/07 11:52:29] <Karkus> As in it is inevitable we would have to partner
[2015/12/07 11:52:36] <brmbrmcar> Jus use a bank account
[2015/12/07 11:53:02] <maths22> brmbrmcar: SOme legal organization needs to own the bank account
[2015/12/07 11:53:10] <maths22> We don't want it to be in one of our names personally
[2015/12/07 11:53:17] <Tobbi> All transaction costs (such as the 4.5% for credit cards, and wire transfer fees) are deducted from the contribution.  5% of the remainder is deducted for SPI overhead, primarily accounting, photocopying and postage.  The remaining money is held in trust for the project.
[2015/12/07 11:53:22] <Karkus> maths22: Precisely
[2015/12/07 11:53:27] <head8debian> Tobbi: Open a paypal account with the supertux openmailbox email address.
[2015/12/07 11:53:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about the fees?
[2015/12/07 11:53:45] <head8debian> Paypal doesn't have fees.
[2015/12/07 11:53:49] <Tobbi> Oh, right.
[2015/12/07 11:53:55] <head8debian> Or ive never known them to.
[2015/12/07 11:54:02] <head8debian> If they did we would be in trouble.
[2015/12/07 11:54:07] <maths22> I will get email set up at some point
[2015/12/07 11:54:16] <maths22> New download URL http://download.supertuxproject.org/download/
[2015/12/07 11:54:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: If we make substantial amounts of money, we should do public statements how much money we have.
[2015/12/07 11:54:23] <Tobbi> Or maybe even otherwise.
[2015/12/07 11:54:29] <Tobbi> It might encourage trust in the project.
[2015/12/07 11:54:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Eh.
[2015/12/07 11:54:34] <head8debian> True.
[2015/12/07 11:54:51] <Tobbi> head8debian: But don't tell them about that secret limousine I intend to buy with the first 1 million.
[2015/12/07 11:54:56] <maths22> (I need to update appveyor to pull from the new site-next build will otherwise fail)
[2015/12/07 11:55:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: ...

[2015/12/07 11:55:09] <brmbrmcar> limousines are bad.

[2015/12/07 11:56:19] <Tobbi> I don't know. I guess someone else could govern the paypal account as well.
[2015/12/07 11:56:49] <brmbrmcar> No me.

[2015/12/07 11:58:49] <head8debian> Id like more devs ATM, than money.
[2015/12/07 11:58:51] <brmbrmcar> I think it is a good idea.
[2015/12/07 11:58:52] <Tobbi> I believe hiker governs donations.
[2015/12/07 11:59:02] <Karkus> head8debian: Yup

[2015/12/07 11:59:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: Then pay it up. :)
[2015/12/07 11:59:30] <mt> why does it have to be .org or .com or .net?
[2015/12/07 11:59:31] <maths22> head8debian: More devs are always useful
[2015/12/07 11:59:31] <Karkus> How much is it?
[2015/12/07 11:59:32] <mt> couldn't a ccTLD work as well?
[2015/12/07 11:59:51] <Tobbi> mt: We have supertuxproject.org which is okay.
[2015/12/07 11:59:51] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/12/07 12:00:00] <Tobbi> It's just that .org is used by many open source projects.
[2015/12/07 12:00:00] <maths22> mt: In general, at this point in time, .org/.com/.net are more trusted by the general public
[2015/12/07 12:00:23] <brmbrmcar> Use something rare.
[2015/12/07 12:00:30] <mt> people trust some tlds more than others, huh?
[2015/12/07 12:00:49] <Karkus> What is the limit on these endings?
[2015/12/07 12:00:50] <maths22> mt: In the sense that they recognize them as legitimate URLs
[2015/12/07 12:00:51] <mt> let's just pay 185000USD to ICANN and register supertux.

[2015/12/07 12:02:21] <brmbrmcar> I was thinking that.
[2015/12/07 12:02:42] <Tobbi> mt: In case we choose to integrate a web server into supertux (let's be honest: Who wouldn't want a webserver inside supertux?), this would be problematic.
[2015/12/07 12:02:53] <brmbrmcar> I always likked bear.bear.bear for a crazy site.

[2015/12/07 12:16:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, we can do that. I'd suggest we also have a public poll and ask people about their ideas.

[2015/12/07 12:19:39] <Tobbi> And some pages just contain single sentences from other pages.
[2015/12/07 12:19:48] <Tobbi> And you need to find the next sentence on a different wiki page.

[2015/12/07 12:36:04] @ Tobbi set topic "Welcome to the SuperTux chat | https://github.com/SuperTux | Stable: 0.1.3 | Beta: 0.3.5a | Travis: https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux | mailing list: supertux-devel@lists.lethargik.org | Channel log http://sydneyjd.github.io/logs/ | nightly builds http://download.supertuxproject.org/download/"
[2015/12/07 12:38:01] <brmbrmmawasm> I tried to freshly install the binary package and it did not work.
[2015/12/07 12:39:37] <brmbrmmawasm> And can the apt-get/yum name be changed to supertux-nightly?
[2015/12/07 12:41:06] <maths22> brmbrmmawasm: Where/what?
[2015/12/07 12:41:17] <maths22> (OS/link would be helpful)
[2015/12/07 12:42:00] <brmbrmmawasm> The .deb file.
[2015/12/07 12:42:18] <maths22> brmbrmmawasm: Those will be fixed up in the near future
[2015/12/07 12:42:25] <brmbrmmawasm> OK.
[2015/12/07 12:42:27] <maths22> (I currently don't expect them to work)
[2015/12/07 12:42:49] <maths22> So I know, though which deb?
[2015/12/07 12:42:59] <brmbrmmawasm> But I mean with the yum stuff, the name supertux is used for other packages.
[2015/12/07 12:43:04] <mt> now, you could get Let's Encrypt for that site
[2015/12/07 12:43:11] <mt> or at least sign the files

[2015/12/07 12:47:17] <maths22> mt: I already have cloudflare set up (although not yet active on the download domain
[2015/12/07 12:47:27] <maths22> Also, I have discovered I can't really do letsencrypt
[2015/12/07 12:47:49] <maths22> It's a freebsd server, and I don't fully control it, so running the client will break things that shouldn't be broken
[2015/12/07 12:47:49] <mt> not even webroot auth?
[2015/12/07 12:48:07] <maths22> mt: what is that?

[2015/12/07 12:49:04] <maths22> mt: That I can do.  The client goes to install packages and stuff
[2015/12/07 12:49:06] <mt> also, you don't need to auto-update the config
[2015/12/07 12:49:12] <maths22> Is there a way to get the cert without it doing that?
[2015/12/07 12:49:28] <mt> there's ACME clients that don't need root

[2015/12/07 12:50:49] <Tobbi> Pulling translations from transifex takes a long time.
[2015/12/07 12:51:23] <brmbrmmawasm> Will I change nick?
[2015/12/07 12:51:52] <maths22> mt: I have ssl running now through cloudflare (so cloudflare to user is protected.  I'll get ssl working right on the backend later

[2015/12/07 12:53:56] <maths22> I'm thinking I'll do a nightly cron job to clean up old builds.  (It will keep the most recent ~3)
[2015/12/07 12:54:01] <maths22> Does that sound reasonable?
[2015/12/07 12:57:12] <brmbrmcar> I haven't a clue.
[2015/12/07 12:58:48] <maths22> Not now, but later I'll work out Windows 64 bit installs
[2015/12/07 12:59:39] <brmbrmcar> Any progress with the Windows builds?
[2015/12/07 13:04:21] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Yes and no (yes on my machine; not yet in a way I am satisfied with for appveyor)
[2015/12/07 13:05:10] <brmbrmcar> So does Wine work?
[2015/12/07 13:05:22] <maths22> I know what I need to do; I just haven't decided how to do it
[2015/12/07 13:05:27] <maths22> Regarding Wine, I have no idea
[2015/12/07 13:05:28] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/07 13:05:47] <maths22> Once it works on Windows 10 and 7, I may test it on Wine
[2015/12/07 13:06:00] <brmbrmcar> Thanks.
[2015/12/07 13:09:42] <Tobbi> We should really find a way to download l10n packages automatically...
[2015/12/07 13:10:09] <Tobbi> Otherwise, people have no idea that they have to download it.
[2015/12/07 13:10:53] <Tobbi> But if I do that, head8debian will complain.
[2015/12/07 13:10:55] <Tobbi> Because slow internet.
[2015/12/07 13:12:15] <maths22> Tobbi: we would check the system language and offer to download if it is not already installed (we might need to bundle a list of supported languages with the application)
[2015/12/07 13:12:53] <Tobbi> maths22: We could actually do that...
[2015/12/07 13:14:51] <brmbrmcar> What are l10 packages?

[2015/12/07 14:09:59] <brmbrmcar> 0.4.3 is neccesary.

[2015/12/07 14:10:15] <mt> if it makes you happy
[2015/12/07 14:10:20] <brmbrmcar> I can't.
[2015/12/07 14:10:25] <mt> why is it necessary?
[2015/12/07 14:10:57] <brmbrmcar> To finish off the stable releases, like 0.1.x.
[2015/12/07 14:11:13] <brmbrmcar> Then 0.5.x can move onto more advanterous stuff.
[2015/12/07 14:11:44] <mt> I mean, everyone in the releng team would be happy if we didn't have so many bugs in 0.4.0 so we'd have to release 3 bugfix releases
[2015/12/07 14:12:06] <mt> why can't we finish off 0.4.z with 0.4.0 or 0.4.1?

[2015/12/07 14:12:48] <brmbrmcar> 0.4.1 is guaranteed. 0.4.2 is good for cfinishig off stuff ,ike vthe forest world.
[2015/12/07 14:13:15] <maths22> brmbrmcar: A final release with the forest world integrated into the main game would definitely warrant releasing as 0.5.0
[2015/12/07 14:13:17] <mt> finishing off stuff, like forest world -> 0.5z
[2015/12/07 14:13:28] <mt> s/5z/5\.z/

[2015/12/07 14:13:49] <maths22> :)
[2015/12/07 14:14:17] <brmbrmcar> Nope.
[2015/12/07 14:14:24] <mt> because that is, as defined by semver a "MINOR version [should be incremented] when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner"
[2015/12/07 14:14:26] <brmbrmcar> It was planned for 0.4.0
[2015/12/07 14:14:37] <mt> then it will be moved to 0.5.z
[2015/12/07 14:14:44] <mt> heck is that so hard to understand?
[2015/12/07 14:14:48] <brmbrmcar> It should be continued.
[2015/12/07 14:15:05] <brmbrmcar> 0.5.x for a tiny change?
[2015/12/07 14:15:21] <maths22> brmbrmcar: How is adding a whole world into the main game "tiny"?
[2015/12/07 14:15:26] <mt> making the forest world fully complete will be a rather big thin-
[2015/12/07 14:15:57] <brmbrmcar> Not really.
[2015/12/07 14:16:06] <brmbrmcar> Just a few more levels.
[2015/12/07 14:16:48] <mt> it will also include a forest boss, possibly continuing in Story Mode directly to Forest World when finished with Icy Island, ... (add your ideas here)
[2015/12/07 14:17:27] <mt> and hey, what's your problem if we end up with 0.128.0?

[2015/12/07 14:17:53] <Tobbi> maths22: Still? I thought I fixed it.

[2015/12/07 14:18:31] <maths22> mt: At what point would we be ready for 1.0.0?
[2015/12/07 14:18:35] <mt> a real story for the forest boss still has to be created
[2015/12/07 14:18:46] <mt> maths22: dunno, if our API is stable
[2015/12/07 14:18:53] <maths22> Tobbi: Nope-see https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux/jobs/95407867
[2015/12/07 14:18:54] <brmbrmcar> Forest boss is done!
[2015/12/07 14:19:03] <brmbrmcar> Don't you realise?
[2015/12/07 14:19:06] <maths22> mt: That is a meaningless concept for SuperTux-it doesn't have an API
[2015/12/07 14:19:07] <brmbrmcar> Tree suck
[2015/12/07 14:19:09] <mt> maths22: I think in a game, that'd refer to stable level and scripting API I guess
[2015/12/07 14:19:11] <Tobbi> damn this.
[2015/12/07 14:19:42] <maths22> mt: That seems reasonable.

[2015/12/07 14:19:57] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/12/07 14:20:36] <mt> brmbrmcar: I think treeboss will still need some changes, which clearly won't be defined as bugfixes.
[2015/12/07 14:20:46] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/12/07 14:21:04] <mt> and 0.4.z would be a bug fix. end of the story.
[2015/12/07 14:21:19] <brmbrmcar> The lantern should be sucked anywhere around the mouth.
[2015/12/07 14:21:36] <brmbrmcar> 0.4.x is Milestone 2 stable! Linke 0.1.x!
[2015/12/07 14:21:45] <mt> then open an issue for this, it's probably not something that's gonna get fixed for 0.4.z
[2015/12/07 14:22:06] <mt> yeah, stable as-is right now.
[2015/12/07 14:22:24] <mt> but we'll probably drop the idea of Milestone x anyway
[2015/12/07 14:22:34] <brmbrmcar> There are things planned for 0.4.x

[2015/12/07 14:22:54] <maths22> mt: I believe it could also be a non-breaking minor improvement
[2015/12/07 14:22:59] <maths22> And still be 0.4.x
[2015/12/07 14:23:03] <mt> brmbrmcar: then we'll move them to plans for 0.5.z; real end of story now
[2015/12/07 14:23:15] <maths22> Tobbi: I was asking if you knew why that happened?
[2015/12/07 14:23:32] <brmbrmcar> *sigh*
[2015/12/07 14:23:32] <Tobbi> maths22: I believe the issue is that the glbinding source code isn't compatible with clang :D
[2015/12/07 14:23:35] <Tobbi> Sorry.
[2015/12/07 14:23:43] <mt> the thing is, we ended up in a mess when we were doing 0.3.x(letter)
[2015/12/07 14:23:57] <mt> and package managers complained
[2015/12/07 14:24:01] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/12/07 14:24:01] <maths22> Tobbi: lovely
[2015/12/07 14:24:11] <maths22> mt: Letters defintely are not helpful for that
[2015/12/07 14:24:13] <Tobbi> maths22: Indeed. It might be fixed with latest master. One needs to check.
[2015/12/07 14:24:25] <brmbrmcar> Yeah, but it is a bad idea to change the planned versioning scheme for the near future.
[2015/12/07 14:24:31] <Tobbi> We should've used underscores.
[2015/12/07 14:24:36] <Tobbi> 0.3.5_1
[2015/12/07 14:25:08] <mt> nah, we should've used something even more ridiculous, like backslashes or the & sign
[2015/12/07 14:25:13] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/07 14:25:15] <mt> 0.3.5\1 or 0.3.5&1
[2015/12/07 14:25:25] <maths22> Tobbi: A fourth decimal would have worked
[2015/12/07 14:25:25] <leper`> just use one more .
[2015/12/07 14:25:30] <maths22> leper`: Exactly
[2015/12/07 14:25:41] <mt> that looked ugly
[2015/12/07 14:25:42] <Tobbi> mt: we have a lot of encodings at our disposal.
[2015/12/07 14:25:44] <Tobbi> bbl
[2015/12/07 14:25:46] <brmbrmcar> The dreaded 0.3.6
[2015/12/07 14:25:53] <mt> so we decided to do 0.3.5a
[2015/12/07 14:26:02] <leper`> _-~ are all used by some packaging schemes to indicate some packaging changes
[2015/12/07 14:26:18] <leper`> (not too sure about _ but I think I saw that somewhere)
[2015/12/07 14:26:43] <brmbrmcar> You should have done 0.3.6, just to keep people happy.
[2015/12/07 14:27:18] <maths22> What was wrong with 0.3.6?
[2015/12/07 14:27:34] <brmbrmcar> It was too soon.
[2015/12/07 14:27:36] <mt> dunno
[2015/12/07 14:28:06] <mt> would have to look at the logs for whatever month, I think april
[2015/12/07 14:29:30] <mt> the thing is, we decided to at least use semver now
[2015/12/07 14:29:49] <brmbrmcar> Where are those logs?
[2015/12/07 14:29:58] <mt> on my server
[2015/12/07 14:30:07] <mt> I won't share them, for privacy reasons
[2015/12/07 14:31:02] <maths22> I'm currently building on a mac pro with 12 cores (probably 6 + hyperthreading)
[2015/12/07 14:31:08] <maths22> It is really fast!
[2015/12/07 14:32:11] <brmbrmcar>  /mode brmbrmcar +o
[2015/12/07 14:32:23] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2015/12/07 14:33:29] <mt> we didn't consider 0.3.6 for a bugfix release
[2015/12/07 14:33:57] <mt> what I proposed: 2015-05-01 20:23:35  mt      speaking of bugfix releases, I'd suggest 0.3.5a instead of 0.3.5.1 (the latter looks ugly imho)
[2015/12/07 14:34:11] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2015/12/07 14:34:16] <mt> no one complained (Tobbi, Seebi were active at that point)
[2015/12/07 14:34:54] <mt> two days later, 'Change version number to 0.3.5a' was committed
[2015/12/07 14:35:58] <brmbrmcar> Ooh...
[2015/12/07 14:36:08] <brmbrmcar> And then released?

[2015/12/07 14:36:42] <mt> basically all the 0.3.5a bugfixes were finished before I proposed 0.3.5a
[2015/12/07 14:36:44] <maths22> Tobbi: OS X icons should be fixed.
[2015/12/07 14:36:58] <maths22> I accidentally was using the windows icon file on os x, which therefore didn't work

[2015/12/07 15:29:39] <leyyin> why the heck do you need the same notification for the same build multiple times
[2015/12/07 15:29:43] <leyyin> what logic can that be?
[2015/12/07 15:30:14] <Hume2> It has no logic at all.

[2015/12/07 15:32:52] <leper`> defeats the purpose of having the bot though
[2015/12/07 15:32:53] <maths22> leyyin: It seems to send the trigger every time some event happens, and the issues are causing that event to be sent way too many times

[2015/12/07 17:00:41] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/07 17:00:51] <brmbrmcar> It wasn;t even pastebin...
[2015/12/07 17:02:12] <maths22> brmbrmcar: File upload, whatever.  Something that expired
[2015/12/07 17:02:20] <maths22> Well, would expire
[2015/12/07 17:02:37] <brmbrmcar> How did you edit my post?
[2015/12/07 17:02:43] <brmbrmcar> Creepy.
[2015/12/07 17:04:01] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I'm apparently a repository admin
[2015/12/07 17:04:24] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/07 17:04:26] <brmbrmcar> OK.

[2015/12/07 17:05:52] <maths22> Tobbi: Oddly, only linux Clang can't do GLBinding

[2015/12/07 17:06:48] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/07 17:07:11] <Tobbi> maths22: Could there be something wrong with FindGLBInding.cmake?
[2015/12/07 17:07:28] <Tobbi> It might not be detecting the correct paths on linux.
[2015/12/07 17:09:34] <maths22> Tobbi: The issue is that it doesn't sucessfully build
[2015/12/07 17:10:00] @ Quit: brmbrmcar: Quit: brmbrmquit
[2015/12/07 17:10:18] <Tobbi> maths22: You're right. I also figured that out earlier. I guess it's time for me to go to bed :D
[2015/12/07 17:10:44] <Tobbi> But a different error this time: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lc++

[2015/12/07 17:16:42] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2015/12/07 17:17:03] <Tobbi> I'll give it a shot.
[2015/12/07 17:17:30] <maths22> Tobbi: Apparently Windows 8.1 works
[2015/12/07 17:17:42] <Tobbi> maths22: We need to install libc++ for clang.
[2015/12/07 17:17:43] <maths22> So something changed between windows 7 and 8.1 that breaks it
[2015/12/07 17:17:45] <Tobbi> It links glbinding against it.
[2015/12/07 17:18:01] <maths22> Tobbi: OK.  We can install that (there should be apt package for it)
[2015/12/07 17:18:15] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2015/12/07 17:18:36] <Tobbi> Is it called libc++-dev?
[2015/12/07 17:18:45] <Tobbi> Also, can we do conditional install?
[2015/12/07 17:19:14] <maths22> Tobbi: no conditional install, but its a pretty small package
[2015/12/07 17:19:17] <maths22> It won't affect much
[2015/12/07 17:19:19] <Tobbi> ok. Good :)

[2015/12/07 17:27:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: Couldn't we store documentation in markdown?
[2015/12/07 17:27:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: Should Flexlay follow the SuperTux SemVer system
[2015/12/07 17:27:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Problem is displaying it
[2015/12/07 17:27:21] <Tobbi> right...
[2015/12/07 17:27:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: I really don't have any preference...we could, though.
[2015/12/07 17:27:46] <Tobbi> Since previous versions of the editor were named after the release as well.
[2015/12/07 17:28:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, I will see if I can come up with a 0.4.0 release.
[2015/12/07 17:28:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: I'd rather skip a 0.4.0 release for the editor.
[2015/12/07 17:28:40] <Tobbi> It's just not ready yet.
[2015/12/07 17:28:44] <Tobbi> No layer toggling etc...
[2015/12/07 17:28:45] <Karkus> Actually, that kind of makes no sense
[2015/12/07 17:29:11] <Karkus> It can't be considered 'stable' for a while
[2015/12/07 17:29:16] <Tobbi> exactly.
[2015/12/07 17:29:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: However, if we name it 0.3 or something, it might be confusing.
[2015/12/07 17:29:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, how about Flexlay can join the SuperTux versioning system at 0.5.0
[2015/12/07 17:29:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: sounds good.
[2015/12/07 17:30:21] <Karkus> Okay, I'll set up a milestone for... when was it? Ah, halloween 2031
[2015/12/07 17:31:06] <Tobbi> Karkus: Exactly... :D
[2015/12/07 17:31:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: We wanted to release a test build, didn't we?
[2015/12/07 17:32:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: We did
[2015/12/07 17:32:08] <Tobbi> Was it announced on the forum?
[2015/12/07 17:32:18] <Karkus> I didn't announce anything
[2015/12/07 17:32:19] <Tobbi> aka 2 weeks before the release to make sure no critical issues were found...
[2015/12/07 17:32:25] <Tobbi> Never mind then.
[2015/12/07 17:32:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: We should do it though.
[2015/12/07 17:32:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's professional
[2015/12/07 17:33:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, we can upload a beta release on Github?
[2015/12/07 17:33:22] <Tobbi> But that might be considered official by some people.
[2015/12/07 17:33:23] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yep. 0.4.0b right?
[2015/12/07 17:33:28] <Tobbi> Okay, that might be good.
[2015/12/07 17:33:36] <maths22> No letters in tags-it will make things be angry
[2015/12/07 17:33:41] <Karkus> It is official, but not a full release
[2015/12/07 17:33:52] <Karkus> maths22: Okay, okay.
[2015/12/07 17:34:02] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2015/12/07 17:34:10] <Karkus> But how can we indicate that it is a beta release
[2015/12/07 17:34:13] <Tobbi> hrm.

[2015/12/07 17:36:17] <maths22> I'll think about this later.  I have an economics final to finish preparing for :(
[2015/12/07 17:36:27] <Karkus> maths22: Still SemVer though?
[2015/12/07 17:37:00] <maths22> Karkus: Yep
[2015/12/07 17:37:11] <Karkus> maths22: Okay
[2015/12/07 17:37:13] <maths22> Semver appears to indicate the correct way to do it is 0.4.0beta
[2015/12/07 17:37:20] <maths22> Sorry - NO!
[2015/12/07 17:37:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could have a project view for a SuperTux add-on for Flexlay... that includes levels, worldmaps, and other media that gets packaged.
[2015/12/07 17:37:25] <maths22> 0.4.0-beta
[2015/12/07 17:37:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes, I've been thinking about the concept of "Projects"
[2015/12/07 17:37:57] <maths22> I need to come up with a way to meaningfully parse that and differentiate the beta from final releases
[2015/12/07 17:38:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes, I've been thinking about the concept of "Project View" issue
[2015/12/07 17:38:05] <maths22> (in the version number)
[2015/12/07 17:38:28] <Tobbi> Karkus: I think it would really make sense. Also, it might give people the idea that they can create their own content and package it.
[2015/12/07 17:38:45] <leper`> maths22: -beta is still bad if you expect someone to package it
[2015/12/07 17:38:49] <Tobbi> I'll crate an issue.
[2015/12/07 17:38:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: So, you make a project, add some levels and a worldmap, package it and send it off to be considered. All from the editor
[2015/12/07 17:38:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: Sounds good.
[2015/12/07 17:39:03] <Tobbi> Sounds great, actually.
[2015/12/07 17:39:04] <Karkus> PyGitHub3 will help here.
[2015/12/07 17:40:06] <maths22> leper`: The only packaging is going to be automatic unoffical packaging
[2015/12/07 17:40:19] <Not-e81f> [02flexlay] 07tobbi opened issue 03#44: Project View - 13http://git.io/vRX4b
[2015/12/07 17:40:23] <leper`> so you mean more of an RC?
[2015/12/07 17:40:28] <Karkus> maths22, leper` and Tobbi: We can call it 0.4.0 beta, *not make a tag*, but create packages for people to test now, then remove them
[2015/12/07 17:40:47] <Karkus> not an official release, just for testing
[2015/12/07 17:40:49] <maths22> Karkus: We can't make it a github release then
[2015/12/07 17:41:02] <Karkus> maths22: Do we have to do that?
[2015/12/07 17:41:05] <maths22> GitHub allows "pre-releases", but they need a tag
[2015/12/07 17:41:09] <maths22> Karkus: not really
[2015/12/07 17:41:21] <Tobbi> I really don't want people to pick up the pre-release...
[2015/12/07 17:41:27] <Tobbi> So, I'd vote against github.
[2015/12/07 17:41:44] <maths22> I think we should just declare one of the automatic builds to be the "pre-release"
[2015/12/07 17:42:00] <maths22> Probably one that hasn't yet been built, but still
[2015/12/07 17:42:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: If they pick it up that's great. They can find issues and help us fix them before 0.4.0 so it's super stable
[2015/12/07 17:42:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Like my Windows bug
[2015/12/07 17:42:22] <maths22> Karkus: What Windows bug?
[2015/12/07 17:43:11] <Karkus> maths22: Didn't you hear about my issue in which whenever the game lost focus on windows it crashed?
[2015/12/07 17:43:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am concerned that people think this is an official "beta" release, like 0.3.5... So that software sites pick it up etc. Because we normally don't release that often.
[2015/12/07 17:43:21] <maths22> Karkus: I didn't
[2015/12/07 17:43:24] <maths22> What build number?

[2015/12/07 17:44:10] <Tobbi> maths22: Will you add the glbinding dependency to .travis.yml or shall I do that?
[2015/12/07 17:45:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: We can put up signs around it and a guarded fence to alert people that it is a beta testing release

[2015/12/07 17:45:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could actually mark it as pre-release and specifically display a "warning".
[2015/12/07 17:45:50] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2015/12/07 17:45:54] <maths22> Karkus: Sure.  Can you tell me what windows version now?
[2015/12/07 17:46:09] <Karkus> maths22: You mean, Windows 10?
[2015/12/07 17:46:31] <Karkus> Windows 10 actual legit version dual booting with Linux Mint
[2015/12/07 17:47:12] <maths22> Karkus: OK.
[2015/12/07 17:47:19] <maths22> I'm on Windows 10 and it likes me
[2015/12/07 17:47:37] <maths22> Did you make a bug for that crash issue?
[2015/12/07 17:47:41] <Karkus> maths22: Even when the game loses focus?
[2015/12/07 17:47:59] <leper`> Tobbi: But milestone2 also displayed some under construction warning
[2015/12/07 17:48:08] <Tobbi> leper`: True...
[2015/12/07 17:48:11] <leper`> so I'd suggest you call that thing a release candidate
[2015/12/07 17:48:14] <maths22> Karkus: Yes
[2015/12/07 17:48:23] <leper`> which should tell packagers that it isn't an actual release
[2015/12/07 17:48:23] <Karkus> maths22: Hmm.
[2015/12/07 17:48:24] <Tobbi> might make sense.
[2015/12/07 17:48:31] <leper`> (which a beta or alpha label does not do)
[2015/12/07 17:48:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: Create a new Logo
[2015/12/07 17:48:46] <Karkus> And stick that in
[2015/12/07 17:48:50] <maths22> Karkus: Did it leave any kind of crash log?
[2015/12/07 17:48:54] <Karkus> Actually...
[2015/12/07 17:48:58] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/07 17:49:02] <Karkus> maths22: No. It froze
[2015/12/07 17:49:14] <maths22> Karkus: Lovely
[2015/12/07 17:49:28] <maths22> Anyways, try the latest build tomorrow, and we will se
[2015/12/07 17:49:32] <maths22> s/se/see/
[2015/12/07 17:49:32] <red_bot> maths22 meant: "Anyways, try the latest build tomorrow, and we will see"
[2015/12/07 17:49:42] <Karkus> maths22: I had to run it from the terminal to keep focus for some reason. If I ran it from the start menu it crashed straight away
[2015/12/07 17:49:56] <maths22> My start menu one definitely works
[2015/12/07 17:50:13] <Karkus> maths22: Hey, I tell you what, as a christmas gift I will go through the pain of doing it now :D
[2015/12/07 17:50:25] <maths22> Karkus: let me guess.  You have to restart?

[2015/12/07 17:54:11] <maths22> That is odd...
[2015/12/07 17:54:53] <maths22> And travis didn't pick it up either

[2015/12/07 18:09:10] <Karkus_on_windos> Windows tried to repair my computer. It's not a fan of dual booting apparently. I hope my Linux partition is okay...
[2015/12/07 18:09:39] <maths22> Karkus_on_windos: Do you have a shared data partition?
[2015/12/07 18:09:55] <maths22> Also, is your nick right?
[2015/12/07 18:09:59] <Karkus_on_windos> I don't think so
[2015/12/07 18:10:04] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/07 18:10:06] <Karkus_on_windos> maths22: Why?
[2015/12/07 18:10:27] <maths22> A good thing to help reduce corruption is to never write to the system partition of the other OS
[2015/12/07 18:10:39] <maths22> Keep shared data to a 3rd parititon
[2015/12/07 18:11:24] <Karkus_on_windos> Ah, I see. I know what I did wrong. I rarely touch the windows one though, it simply sits there being a just in case
[2015/12/07 18:11:39] <Karkus_on_windos> I should create a recovery drive and get rid of it
[2015/12/07 18:12:36] <Karkus_on_windos> Also, it's a shame that with Google Chrome and Windows 10 I have to click away 2 security warnings to run your installer
[2015/12/07 18:12:40] <maths22> Karkus_on_windos: You really shouldn't create something just to get rid of it :(
[2015/12/07 18:12:59] <Karkus_on_windos> maths22: I think you know what I mean
[2015/12/07 18:13:29] <maths22> Karkus_on_windos: I do, I was just being annoying
[2015/12/07 18:13:50] <Karkus_on_windos> I won't complain, I'm guilty of it myself
[2015/12/07 18:14:02] <Karkus_on_windos> Okay, I've got it installing
[2015/12/07 18:14:50] <maths22> Karkus_on_windos: I wish I could reduce the warning, but to the best of my knowledge, without some kind of approval process, there is no way to elimiate them

[2015/12/07 18:15:12] <Karkus_on_windos> maths22: I understand.
[2015/12/07 18:15:45] <Karkus_on_windos> Problem is I have to click on all the More Info > Advanced options etc.
[2015/12/07 18:16:13] <Karkus_on_windos> If it is a virus, it'd better not have touched my Linux partition
[2015/12/07 18:16:53] <maths22> Karkus_on_windos: I promise, not a virus :)
[2015/12/07 18:17:22] <Karkus_on_windos> Nope, still not working
[2015/12/07 18:17:24] <Karkus_on_windos> :(
[2015/12/07 18:18:02] <Karkus_on_windos> If I minimise the window, the music keeps playing and I can click things, but I can't see anything. Is this an SDL problem?
[2015/12/07 18:18:10] <Karkus_on_windos> maths22: ^
[2015/12/07 18:18:31] <maths22> Karkus_on_windos: So you minimize it and then maximize it, and it is blank?
[2015/12/07 18:18:42] <Karkus_on_windos> Yep. Can't see a thing
[2015/12/07 18:18:46] <maths22> Same behavior on my machine
[2015/12/07 18:18:56] <Karkus_on_windos> maths22: Damn
[2015/12/07 18:19:02] <maths22> I thought you meant lose focus like put something in front of it
[2015/12/07 18:19:12] <maths22> And yes, probably a SDL thing.  I'll investigate later
[2015/12/07 18:19:30] <Karkus_on_windos> maths22: That was a problem before I think, but it's not anymore.
[2015/12/07 18:19:37] <Karkus_on_windos> I can't remember
[2015/12/07 18:19:47] <Karkus_on_windos> As long as I don't minimise it, it's fine.
[2015/12/07 18:20:20] <maths22> Interesting...
[2015/12/07 18:20:33] <maths22> If I minimze and then maximize, and then resize the window, it turns black
[2015/12/07 18:21:55] <maths22> Karkus_on_windos: Are you using integrated intel graphics?
[2015/12/07 18:22:04] <Karkus_on_windos> Yes
[2015/12/07 18:22:17] <Karkus_on_windos> Are you?
[2015/12/07 18:22:24] <Karkus_on_windos> I'm on a Laptop
[2015/12/07 18:22:52] <maths22> See https://community.roonlabs.com/t/windows-8-1-blank-white-screen-after-maximising/1874/24
[2015/12/07 18:23:49] <maths22> It might be the same thing
[2015/12/07 18:24:05] <Karkus_on_windos> maths22: Okay, so what's at the root of this problem? Is it SDL? I think it is
[2015/12/07 18:24:15] <Karkus_on_windos> I think it is the same problem I mean
[2015/12/07 18:24:51] <maths22> Karkus_on_windos: I think it is opengl

[2015/12/07 18:29:50] <Karkus_on_windos> And also now I'm getting graphical glitches
[2015/12/07 18:29:52] <Karkus_on_windos> Are you?
[2015/12/07 18:29:59] <maths22> A bit
[2015/12/07 18:30:07] <maths22> this is the tradeoff
[2015/12/07 18:30:51] <maths22> SDL is not hardware-accelerated, but it also doesnt have the intel glitch
[2015/12/07 18:30:59] <Karkus_on_windos> maths22: Like lines between the tiles?

[2015/12/08 09:23:27] <head8debian> Good morning jesusalva.
[2015/12/08 09:23:40] <jesusalva> Good afternoon head8debian
[2015/12/08 09:23:50] <jesusalva> 12:21:20 here
[2015/12/08 09:24:01] <head8debian> jesusalva: Your that far ahead in time zones? o_O
[2015/12/08 09:24:12] <jesusalva> No, but summer time just started.
[2015/12/08 09:24:21] <jesusalva> So now we are... 2 hours different, right?
[2015/12/08 09:24:22] @ Quit: Tobbi: Ping timeout: 272 seconds
[2015/12/08 09:24:38] <jesusalva> There is 10:21, when I woke up, correct?
[2015/12/08 09:25:18] <head8debian> jesusalva: Well, we have daylight savings time, so its now 9:22.
[2015/12/08 09:26:01] <jesusalva> So. Summer time. You go one hour backwards? I go one hour foward. So now I'm on GMT -0200.
[2015/12/08 09:26:07] <jesusalva> When usual is GMT -0300.
[2015/12/08 09:26:54] <jesusalva> This makes easier to talk with people like Tobbi and giby, as they usually are on GMT +0200 timezone.
[2015/12/08 09:27:03] <jesusalva> The difference goes from 5 to 4 hours.
[2015/12/08 09:27:14] <head8debian> jesusalva: We go forward one hour in spring and back one in fall. I hate it.
[2015/12/08 09:27:33] <jesusalva> Same here.
[2015/12/08 09:27:43] <jesusalva> However I learnt to like it.
[2015/12/08 09:28:13] <jesusalva> All right you'll never get used to time. When you finally understand time, it changes again.
[2015/12/08 09:28:34] <jesusalva> So I read by sun ("The sun is marking 13:00") and then I add one on summertime.
[2015/12/08 09:29:00] <jesusalva> A lot of people who I know dislikes it too. Some like because they get home "ealier"
[2015/12/08 09:29:13] <jesusalva> Others dislike because then they wake up on dark.
[2015/12/08 09:29:56] <jesusalva> And some dislikes even more because they work 'till the sun set. (Not allowed per law) And that way the sun takes longer to set (it takes longer to set on summer anyway)
[2015/12/08 09:30:43] <jesusalva> After all, day is bigger on summer, and night is bigger on winter, and only on the first day of spring/fall they have the same length, correct, head8debian?

[2015/12/08 09:43:51] <head8debian> jesusalva: True.
[2015/12/08 09:44:07] <head8debian> jesusalva: I don't like getting up when its so dark. :)
[2015/12/08 09:44:48] <jesusalva> Haha! Thankfully, during over half of it, I'm on vacations and can wake up late. ;)
[2015/12/08 09:45:18] <head8debian> jesusalva: Heh, i have to get up every day at the same time no matter what. :)
[2015/12/08 09:45:27] <jesusalva> And I usually live near the school, which starts at 07:00, so even on summer time, I still wake up when it's bright.
[2015/12/08 09:45:57] <jesusalva> Vacations can be annoying imo. It's a time which you don't do absolutely nothing.
[2015/12/08 09:46:17] <jesusalva> No work, no stress... Boring, in some ways.
[2015/12/08 09:47:11] <head8debian> jesusalva: heh, seems like i always have something to do, and the days are never quite long enough. :)
[2015/12/08 09:47:15] @ Quit: alket: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2015/12/08 09:47:26] <head8debian> Maybe if i didn't sit in IRC yacking i could get more done. :D
[2015/12/08 09:47:50] <jesusalva> Even on regular school days, I find myself bored with nothing to do.
[2015/12/08 09:48:23] <jesusalva> So I joined Student Council. Was secretary. Become President. Downgraded myself to 2nd president, and then went back to secretary.
[2015/12/08 09:48:35] <head8debian> jesusalva: I guess we are quite oposite then. :)
[2015/12/08 09:48:52] <head8debian> Wanna come over in your free time and help me get some stuff done? :D
[2015/12/08 09:49:02] <jesusalva> And yet, I didn't lost influence on the council. I was probably the secretary who took most executive decisions.
[2015/12/08 09:49:22] <jesusalva> Hm. If you pay my plane ticket, I don't mind. ;)
[2015/12/08 09:49:34] <head8debian> o_O I think i will pass.
[2015/12/08 09:49:34] <jesusalva> (Just joking anyway. I'm not cut for manual work)
[2015/12/08 09:49:58] <jesusalva> My cut is mostly paperwork. Theorics.
[2015/12/08 09:50:04] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/12/08 09:50:16] <jesusalva> Do executive decisions and reports, that's my concept of cool.
[2015/12/08 09:50:25] * jesusalva may be exaggerating.
[2015/12/08 09:50:42] <jesusalva> That's why even as secretary I still took a lot of executive decisions.
[2015/12/08 09:50:54] <head8debian> My legs are still very sore. Last friday i had a 200lb kid jump on my back, and i could not hold him up. Feels like he pulled all my leg muscles appart.
[2015/12/08 09:50:59] <head8debian> :D
[2015/12/08 09:51:17] <head8debian> jesusalva: Sounds like you enjoy what you do somewhat. :)
[2015/12/08 09:51:18] <jesusalva> Amazing! I mean, awful.
[2015/12/08 09:51:29] * jesusalva took this out of a movie
[2015/12/08 09:51:36] <head8debian> Im only 150lbs myself. :p
[2015/12/08 09:51:51] <jesusalva> head8debian: I like. If I don't like, I usually quit. Simple like that.
[2015/12/08 09:52:05] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/12/08 09:52:16] <jesusalva> head8debian: I'm about 40 kg, a little heavier. I eat every 2 hours, right now I'm eating a cookie, and have a cookie pack on my desk.
[2015/12/08 09:52:50] <jesusalva> There's no point in keep doing something I don't like, most of times. THat's why I quit. But I don't like quitting, so I simply don't join.
[2015/12/08 09:53:08] * jesusalva is very weird.
[2015/12/08 09:53:53] <jesusalva> Style: My favorite food contains what I hate most. Not really, eggs with potato are both good.
[2015/12/08 09:54:04] <head8debian> Heh. :-)
[2015/12/08 09:54:14] <jesusalva> But like, I hate, soy, let's say. And my favorite food, say, have soy.
[2015/12/08 09:54:54] <head8debian> jesusalva: Your 40kg? Thats like 90 pounds isnt it?
[2015/12/08 09:55:05] <jesusalva> No idea. :P
[2015/12/08 09:55:40] <jesusalva> An average person weights about 60kg to 70kg.
[2015/12/08 09:56:25] <jesusalva> 80kg is fat, 100kg is very very fat, 120kg... Is the fat guy who sits on his couch watching TV and eating all day long, and only leaves to see the doctor.
[2015/12/08 09:56:43] <jesusalva> And have health problems by serious overweight.
[2015/12/08 09:57:51] <head8debian> Maybe my calculations are wrong.
[2015/12/08 09:58:06] <jesusalva> No idea. How much an average person weights?
[2015/12/08 09:59:00] <head8debian> But then again, im the brazil opinion of fat is diferent than the american opinion of fat.
[2015/12/08 09:59:24] <head8debian> If duckduckgo is right, 100kg is 220LBs.
[2015/12/08 09:59:33] <jesusalva> I think an american weights about 70~80kg, not sure.
[2015/12/08 10:00:01] <jesusalva> Maybe more.
[2015/12/08 10:00:59] <head8debian> Yeah, average for men is is about 80kg.
[2015/12/08 10:01:17] <head8debian> Im roughly 70kg, i think.
[2015/12/08 10:02:14] <head8debian> 80kg is fat? o_O We consider that quite skinny.
[2015/12/08 10:02:17] <jesusalva> Makes sense.
[2015/12/08 10:02:57] <head8debian> Are Brazilians just bones with skin stretched on top? :)
[2015/12/08 10:03:00] <head8debian> No insult. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:03:04] <jesusalva> I wonder what I am. :/
[2015/12/08 10:03:13] <jesusalva> I'm thin on my country.
[2015/12/08 10:03:45] <jesusalva> head8debian: I think that's correct. I'm about 88 pounds.
[2015/12/08 10:04:06] <head8debian> jesusalva: How tall are you?
[2015/12/08 10:04:20] <jesusalva> Hm. About 1.7meters. And you?
[2015/12/08 10:04:30] <head8debian> Ugg, conversions. :)
[2015/12/08 10:04:37] <jesusalva> Yep, same here.
[2015/12/08 10:04:46] <jesusalva> Is it difficult to not use SI? :/
[2015/12/08 10:05:21] <head8debian> Im roughtly 1.85meters
[2015/12/08 10:05:38] <head8debian> jesusalva: You must be a rack of bones, IMO. :)
[2015/12/08 10:05:50] <head8debian> No insult intended. :)
[2015/12/08 10:05:57] <jesusalva> I'm skinny, that's for sure. :/
[2015/12/08 10:06:07] * jesusalva assumes he understood the word.
[2015/12/08 10:06:14] <head8debian> We just don't have that many people your age and height that weigh so little.
[2015/12/08 10:06:27] <jesusalva> Same here. ;D
[2015/12/08 10:06:29] <head8debian> But your fine. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:06:37] <jesusalva> Most weight between 50~60kg.
[2015/12/08 10:06:56] <head8debian> Which is still quite light.
[2015/12/08 10:06:56] <jesusalva> Hmm... 110 to 132 lb
[2015/12/08 10:07:07] <head8debian> Compared to us Americans, anyways. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:07:37] <jesusalva> Yes, I'm not really sure 'cause I don't go asking everyones weight. After all, about 80% of my class is composed of girls. Our class have 41 students.
[2015/12/08 10:07:54] <jesusalva> Which is annoying 'cause 41 cannot be divided, except by 1 and 41.
[2015/12/08 10:08:10] <head8debian> jesusalva: Ah. Girls are generally lighter, or they try to be anyways. Heh. :)
[2015/12/08 10:08:24] <jesusalva> A student with 65kg is not fat. About 143 lb.
[2015/12/08 10:08:34] <head8debian> No, definately not.
[2015/12/08 10:08:59] <head8debian> jesusalva: How did we get on this subject? :p
[2015/12/08 10:09:05] <jesusalva> I'm pretty sure my parents have about 70 kg, on most 80.
[2015/12/08 10:09:10] * jesusalva reads logs
[2015/12/08 10:09:14] <head8debian> Oh, yes, i remember. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:09:20] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/12/08 10:09:31] <jesusalva> We were on summer time.
[2015/12/08 10:09:46] <jesusalva> And then you commented an incident.
[2015/12/08 10:09:54] <head8debian> :-0
[2015/12/08 10:09:56] <head8debian> )
[2015/12/08 10:09:58] <head8debian> ***
[2015/12/08 10:10:14] <jesusalva> Which a "car of 90 kg (fat for sure) got on you"
[2015/12/08 10:10:25] * jesusalva is not being serious
[2015/12/08 10:10:38] <head8debian> What? :-0
[2015/12/08 10:10:39] <head8debian> )*
[2015/12/08 10:10:42] <jesusalva> We use 'truck', but I'm not sure how that would sound for you.
[2015/12/08 10:11:05] <head8debian> jesusalva: I prefer the word "truck" over car... mainly because i don't want to drive a car. :)
[2015/12/08 10:11:14] <jesusalva> Managed to sell it?
[2015/12/08 10:11:24] <head8debian> jesusalva: Hmm?
[2015/12/08 10:11:35] <jesusalva> You were trying to sell it some time ago.
[2015/12/08 10:11:38] <jesusalva> If I'm not mistaken.
[2015/12/08 10:12:08] <head8debian> jesusalva: You're correct. Yes, i did manage to sell it.
[2015/12/08 10:12:22] <jesusalva> My memory is doubled. I have one doing something important (talk to you) and another who just shuffles though memory log files. So I remember random things even if it's not what I want.
[2015/12/08 10:12:24] <head8debian> jesusalva: Actually, ive had 2 cars that ive fixed up and managed to sell.
[2015/12/08 10:12:35] <jesusalva> By example, I need to complete ST translations.
[2015/12/08 10:12:42] <head8debian> jesusalva: Im working on another car ATM.
[2015/12/08 10:12:45] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/12/08 10:12:48] <jesusalva> :)
[2015/12/08 10:13:22] <jesusalva> How much you gain on that? After all, you have costs getting the broken car and fixing it.
[2015/12/08 10:13:38] <head8debian> jesusalva: I made $300 on my last car.
[2015/12/08 10:13:53] <head8debian> jesusalva: But they are quite time consuming to fix and sell. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:13:54] <jesusalva> That's over R$ 1,000
[2015/12/08 10:14:20] <head8debian> jesusalva: Hmm? Is that your currency?
[2015/12/08 10:14:23] <jesusalva> About an average monthly paycheck.
[2015/12/08 10:14:37] <jesusalva> Yes. 'Real'. Tranlated, real or royal, both are correct.
[2015/12/08 10:14:37] <head8debian> jesusalva: Wow.
[2015/12/08 10:15:01] <head8debian> jesusalva: $300 up here is a weekly pay check.
[2015/12/08 10:15:02] <jesusalva> Actually it's most common either 1,000 or 2,000. Depends on job.
[2015/12/08 10:15:33] <jesusalva> head8debian: And we were the 7th in economics. ;D
[2015/12/08 10:15:34] <head8debian> jesusalva: But mind you that half of it goes to taxes...
[2015/12/08 10:15:41] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/12/08 10:15:54] <head8debian> Our economy is not doing so well ATM. :0
[2015/12/08 10:15:55] <head8debian> )*
[2015/12/08 10:16:00] <jesusalva> head8debian: IRRF, 27.5% of taxes taken before you get your money.
[2015/12/08 10:16:16] <head8debian> Its about 33% here.
[2015/12/08 10:16:30] <head8debian> Plus 15% on top of that.
[2015/12/08 10:16:38] <head8debian> Or was it 12%?
[2015/12/08 10:16:41] <jesusalva> And then you pay the IR, a parent of IRRF, which is the 'on top of that'.
[2015/12/08 10:16:48] <jesusalva> Not sure about the taxes of it.
[2015/12/08 10:17:05] <head8debian> m not the greatest with taxes, but they do add up.
[2015/12/08 10:17:10] <head8debian> I'm*
[2015/12/08 10:17:25] <jesusalva> There is also INSS, about 11%, but it stops increasing after R$ 4663.75.
[2015/12/08 10:17:50] <head8debian> jesusalva: As a dairy farm we go through over 20,000$ a month, but almost all of it goes to pay bills.
[2015/12/08 10:17:50] <jesusalva> So if you gain over that amount, you pay the same INSS. In other way, you pay more IRRF with worser taxes.
[2015/12/08 10:17:56] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/12/08 10:18:24] <jesusalva> Politicans like to create names for taxes. INSS. IRRF. IR. IPTU. ICMS. And the list goes on.
[2015/12/08 10:18:29] <head8debian> Cows are expensive critters to feed and bed and take care of. :)
[2015/12/08 10:18:46] <jesusalva> Forgot IPVA.
[2015/12/08 10:18:55] <head8debian> Heh, yes, names.
[2015/12/08 10:19:02] <jesusalva> Most start with 'I', 'Imposto' (Tax)
[2015/12/08 10:20:01] <jesusalva> Tax of social previdence. Tax over income. Tax over income reatined on source. Tax over residence. Tax over commercial operation. Tax over authomobilistc vehicle. Tax over profission.
[2015/12/08 10:20:13] <jesusalva> They forgot to create 'Tax over breathed air'
[2015/12/08 10:20:24] <head8debian> jesusalva: I was jsut going to say that.
[2015/12/08 10:20:29] <jesusalva> But they did a tax over water. It comes on your water bill.
[2015/12/08 10:20:45] <jesusalva> head8debian: I know, I read your mind. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:20:54] <head8debian> jesusalva: As my dad says, if they can tax you for it the *will* tax you for it.
[2015/12/08 10:21:01] <head8debian> j...
[2015/12/08 10:21:04] <head8debian> jesusalva: ...
[2015/12/08 10:21:11] <jesusalva> I agree.
[2015/12/08 10:21:47] <jesusalva> If you see the reunions, subject is: "Rename street 25 to street John of Debian Sourcehat".
[2015/12/08 10:22:07] <jesusalva> And they spend the whole day discussing and the conclusion: We talk about it on next reunion.
[2015/12/08 10:22:16] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/12/08 10:22:44] <jesusalva> Recess. We meet next week for our next reunion. Util then you're free to do whatever you want. You probably don't even need to go t/here.
[2015/12/08 10:23:41] <jesusalva> And not to say that they don't work on July, and probably on December and January as well. If I record well, about 45 days of recess on July month.
[2015/12/08 10:23:49] * jesusalva is not sure though.
[2015/12/08 10:24:33] <head8debian> Anyways, i need to get some school done. Nice talking to you again jesusalva. :)
[2015/12/08 10:24:45] <jesusalva> Nice for me too. See you. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:24:56] * jesusalva just had a lunch.

[2015/12/08 10:30:13] <maths22> Is anyone online right now to test the windows or os x builds on their machine?
[2015/12/08 10:31:24] * jesusalva uses Ubuntu 14.04 and haves no windows.
[2015/12/08 10:32:04] * jesusalva uses wine at most. And mess with DLL libraries for best performance possible.
[2015/12/08 10:33:09] <maths22> jesusalva: Fair.  Actually, can you see if the Windows build runs in wine for you?
[2015/12/08 10:33:22] <jesusalva> Where can I get it?

[2015/12/08 10:36:51] <head8debian> maths22: I can test it in both wine and windows.
[2015/12/08 10:37:01] <head8debian> windows 10, that is.
[2015/12/08 10:37:53] <maths22> head8debian: If you could, that would be great
[2015/12/08 10:38:44] <head8debian> If it opens i figure everything is OK. :)
[2015/12/08 10:39:54] <maths22> head8debian: Can you check if it lets you install an addon
[2015/12/08 10:40:13] <brmbrmcar> Where's the startup file now?
[2015/12/08 10:40:13] <head8debian> I will, its still downloading.
[2015/12/08 10:40:19] <maths22> I think I fixed that last night, but I want to make sure the fix is in the build
[2015/12/08 10:40:34] <brmbrmcar> ITS WORKING
[2015/12/08 10:40:37] <maths22> brmbrmcar: C:/Program Files/SuperTux/bin/supertux2.exe (I think)

[2015/12/08 10:42:02] <brmbrmcar> I am over-excited. :D
[2015/12/08 10:42:13] <maths22> Excited is good
[2015/12/08 10:44:24] <head8debian> maths22: How do you open a .msi? Just like a .exe?
[2015/12/08 10:44:30] <brmbrmcar> Yeah
[2015/12/08 10:45:53] <maths22> head8debian: Is this question for wine or Windows 10?
[2015/12/08 10:47:21] <head8debian> maths22: Ive got it. Wine. ;)
[2015/12/08 10:47:29] <head8debian> Wine is clunky in a terminal, well somewhat.
[2015/12/08 10:48:17] <maths22> I agree
[2015/12/08 10:48:29] <head8debian> maths22: https://paste.debian.net/342272/
[2015/12/08 10:49:07] <maths22> head8debian: What linux distro?
[2015/12/08 10:49:11] <head8debian> maths22:Arch.
[2015/12/08 10:49:24] <maths22> You need to install lib32-libldap or the equivalent for your platform
[2015/12/08 10:49:44] <maths22> That is Wine saying it can't load the necessary linux library to load the windows dll
[2015/12/08 10:49:51] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/12/08 10:50:03] <maths22> (Why CURL has an ldap dependency I don't know, but the ldap dll is built into windows)
[2015/12/08 10:50:14] <head8debian> Ok, installed, now i have anotehr error. :)

[2015/12/08 10:52:07] <maths22> What wine version is this?
[2015/12/08 10:52:38] <head8debian> maths22: 1.8
[2015/12/08 10:53:16] <head8debian> In other words, the latest version.
[2015/12/08 10:53:34] <maths22> Interesting.  It seems to work on 1.6 (in my Debian VM)
[2015/12/08 10:55:40] <maths22> Is this 32 or 64 bit wine
[2015/12/08 10:56:48] <head8debian> maths22: I belive 64 bit.
[2015/12/08 10:57:04] <maths22> Also, can you paste the list of files in drive_c/Program Files (x86)/SuperTux/bin
[2015/12/08 10:57:52] <maths22> And tell me what Windows version your winecfg is set to?
[2015/12/08 10:58:41] <head8debian> maths22: Its set to windows XP.
[2015/12/08 10:58:53] <head8debian> maths22: https://paste.debian.net/342281/
[2015/12/08 10:59:14] <head8debian> Ok, now set to windows 8.
[2015/12/08 10:59:17] <head8debian> No changes.
[2015/12/08 11:00:59] <maths22> head8debian: I was more curious if it was set to Windows 10, in which case it thought it might break
[2015/12/08 11:01:29] <head8debian> maths22: I will test supertux in Win 10 later, i have to reboot to do that and i hate rebooting. :p
[2015/12/08 11:01:32] <maths22> And the right DLLs got installed.  I bet it is a 64/32 bit thing
[2015/12/08 11:01:45] <head8debian> hmm.
[2015/12/08 11:01:46] <maths22> I'll investigate more later.  Wine64 1.6 doesn't like it
[2015/12/08 11:02:01] <maths22> I need to reboot the other direction-I have fedora but am right now in windows 10

[2015/12/08 11:37:17] <maths22> Karkus: Good news: the Windows build works in wine (at least in some cases)
[2015/12/08 11:37:48] <maths22> Bad news: the open GL issue is probably not fixable in software-Microsoft Outlook apparently suffers from the same issue
[2015/12/08 11:38:17] <leyyin> why do you need the windows build to run on wine ;) ?
[2015/12/08 11:38:36] <leyyin> seems completely pointless
[2015/12/08 11:41:09] <brmbrmcar> maths22: I'll check.
[2015/12/08 11:41:31] <brmbrmcar> I used my old .supertux2 files...

[2015/12/08 11:42:02] <maths22> brmbrmcar seemed interested, so I figured I would check
[2015/12/08 11:42:10] <maths22> brmbrmcar: What error?
[2015/12/08 11:42:51] <brmbrmcar> schannel: failed to setup sequence direction
[2015/12/08 11:43:16] <brmbrmcar> Same for addons Check Online.
[2015/12/08 11:43:59] <maths22> brmbrmcar: That is a wine/curl error
[2015/12/08 11:44:18] <Karkus> maths22: Yay, now I can run SuperTux on Wine.
[2015/12/08 11:44:26] <maths22> It works with native windows schannel, so I won't worry about it too much for now
[2015/12/08 11:44:36] <maths22> Karkus: Apparently addons don't work (the curl downloading part)
[2015/12/08 11:44:43] <leyyin> Karkus, like trying to use a hammer to clean dishes ;)
[2015/12/08 11:44:47] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/08 11:45:15] <Karkus> maths22: I don't think wine is the most effective way to play supertux on Linux
[2015/12/08 11:45:19] <maths22> leyyin: Hopefully I'll get the open build service builds happy later
[2015/12/08 11:45:20] <brmbrmcar> leyyin: You don't get it, do you?

[2015/12/08 13:13:44] <Karkus> Get Linux
[2015/12/08 13:13:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: Would you know a way to prevent the issue from happening? Because, I actually don't.
[2015/12/08 13:13:59] <Hume2> :D I'd advise it anyway.
[2015/12/08 13:14:09] <Tobbi> I don't know enough about SDL anyway.
[2015/12/08 13:14:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, but that doesn't make it a good thing
[2015/12/08 13:14:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't know a thing about SDL
[2015/12/08 13:14:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, I agree with you there.
[2015/12/08 13:14:41] <Tobbi> Was just thinking in terms of worrying and workload.
[2015/12/08 13:14:45] <Tobbi> Project manager thing :D
[2015/12/08 13:14:50] <Karkus> :D
[2015/12/08 13:15:22] <brmbrmcar> Give me my workload, Project Manager.
[2015/12/08 13:15:32] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: We already have
[2015/12/08 13:15:42] <Karkus> Haven't you finished the Operating System?
[2015/12/08 13:15:59] <brmbrmcar> What OS?
[2015/12/08 13:16:00] <Tobbi> We talked about the brmbrmlanguage, didn't we?
[2015/12/08 13:16:05] <Tobbi> brmbrmprogramming language.
[2015/12/08 13:16:14] <brmbrmcar> Oh.
[2015/12/08 13:16:16] <Tobbi> So, finish that
[2015/12/08 13:16:53] @ brmbrmcar is now known as brmbrmmawasm
[2015/12/08 13:17:14] <Tobbi> Can anyone trigger a coverity_scan build?
[2015/12/08 13:17:16] <Tobbi> I have to go.
[2015/12/08 13:17:35] <Karkus> I don't get it. brmbrmmawasm?
[2015/12/08 13:17:59] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't know how
[2015/12/08 13:18:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: checkout coverity_scan, git rebase origin/master
[2015/12/08 13:18:23] <Tobbi> but, let me quickly do it.

[2015/12/08 13:21:01] <brmbrmcar> What language you want?
[2015/12/08 13:23:09] <brmbrmcar> I mean, what language do you want the programming language in?
[2015/12/08 13:24:06] <Hume2> I'd say Tobbian C++ and not brmbrmC++.
[2015/12/08 13:26:12] <brmbrmcar> C++? Already made!
[2015/12/08 13:27:17] <Hume2> Well, what was you working on and Tobbi refused it last time?
[2015/12/08 13:27:35] <brmbrmcar> Stuff like mweee.

[2015/12/08 13:28:34] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/12/08 13:28:49] <Hume2> It's really very useful for SuperTux. Yes. Another thing?
[2015/12/08 13:28:59] <brmbrmcar> Means "I will finish it soon"
[2015/12/08 13:29:27] <Hume2> Tell me something about that.

[2015/12/08 13:36:54] <Hume2> Don't you know that it was a trol?

[2015/12/08 13:37:48] <Hume2> Who has asked you to create it?
[2015/12/08 13:38:14] <brmbrmcar> It was discusserd that I would be asked while I was offline.

[2015/12/08 13:45:41] <brmbrmcar> Maybe...
[2015/12/08 13:45:56] <brmbrmcar> Essentially a clone of C...
[2015/12/08 13:53:17] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: We were joking. Making OSs or Compilers is super difficult to do well, and takes many people and lots of time. I didn't think you'd take us seriously. You're welcome to have a go, of course, but it's really tough.
[2015/12/08 13:55:41] <brmbrmcar> Finally. The truth.
[2015/12/08 13:56:59] <brmbrmcar> You told me to make a language. I was planning to juast change the wording.
[2015/12/08 13:58:05] <Hume2> Almost everyone who knows what it is about can't take this seriously.
[2015/12/08 13:59:14] <brmbrmcar> I sort of knew it would make anything...

[2015/12/08 16:23:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: sounds good.
[2015/12/08 16:24:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: One more thing: I defaulted to worldmap.strf for worldmaps. Think that's better than specifying the tileset...
[2015/12/08 16:24:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: Between you, me, maths22, Hume2 and mt, we can decide a date more precisely
[2015/12/08 16:24:20] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/12/08 16:24:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: We should possibly consider switching to PyQT5...

[2015/12/08 16:27:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: I deliberately set it to ask with worldmaps due to world1 having its own worldmap tileset
[2015/12/08 16:28:03] <Tobbi> oh!
[2015/12/08 16:28:11] <Tobbi> I will check that.

[2015/12/08 16:30:28] <Tobbi> So, we should fetch that.

[2015/12/09 12:51:48] <brmbrmcar> That was what I was fixing in that pull request.
[2015/12/09 12:52:07] <Hume2> Karkus: Yes, I have tested it myself.

[2015/12/09 13:11:17] <brmbrmcar> I cloned patch-2.
[2015/12/09 13:11:25] <Karkus> Why?
[2015/12/09 13:11:35] <brmbrmcar> I a very low on disk space.
[2015/12/09 13:11:46] <Karkus> It makes no difference
[2015/12/09 13:11:53] <Karkus> Well, almost no difference

[2015/12/09 13:13:16] <Karkus> How much disk space do you have?
[2015/12/09 13:13:20] <brmbrmcar> 400MB is too much generally...
[2015/12/09 13:13:34] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: You can remove it afterwards, right/
[2015/12/09 13:13:35] <Karkus> ?
[2015/12/09 13:13:54] <brmbrmcar> Fine. *sigh*
[2015/12/09 13:14:33] <Hume2> Only Tobbi has the right to say this here.

[2015/12/09 13:15:16] <Karkus> Also, Hume2, is this http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Scripting_reference up to date or not?
[2015/12/09 13:15:18] <Hume2> You know, the word begining on * and ending on *.

[2015/12/09 13:15:45] <brmbrmcar> You do it.
[2015/12/09 13:16:00] <Hume2> It was my fault that I used this.
[2015/12/09 13:17:30] <Hume2> Karkus: I'm not sure. I can say that I added the add_bonus to SuperTux, because it was in the scripting refference but not in SuperTux.
[2015/12/09 13:18:45] <Karkus> Hume2: Is this where you learnt how to script?

[2015/12/09 13:19:56] <Hume2> Karkus: Yes.
[2015/12/09 13:20:12] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: use set_bonus instead.
[2015/12/09 13:20:14] <Karkus> Hume2: Okay. You can edit the wiki right?
[2015/12/09 13:20:39] <Hume2> Karkus: Not the locked pages.

[2015/12/09 13:20:58] <Karkus> Hume2: okay
[2015/12/09 13:21:19] <maths22> Is there anyone here who would be able to grant me a wiki account?
[2015/12/09 13:21:21] <brmbrmcar> None works.

[2015/12/09 13:23:25] <Karkus> maths22: No, only Tobbi. He went on a quest set by Mathnerd, and achieved that status. He then made me an account.
[2015/12/09 13:23:40] <Karkus> maths22: You can make an account
[2015/12/09 13:23:45] <Karkus> I think...
[2015/12/09 13:24:15] <maths22> I can't :(
[2015/12/09 13:24:37] <Karkus> maths22: You'll have to wait for Tobbi then...
[2015/12/09 13:24:46] <maths22> Karkus: That's fine.  I'll ask him later
[2015/12/09 13:24:49] <brmbrmcar> I have only got a normal account.
[2015/12/09 13:25:01] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: How'd you get that?
[2015/12/09 13:25:09] <brmbrmcar> And also, what are you planning to change?
[2015/12/09 13:25:31] <brmbrmcar> Kakus: Right after all the crazy files I changed.
[2015/12/09 13:26:00] <maths22> brmbrmcar: For now, nothing particular
[2015/12/09 13:26:11] <maths22> I just feel like I should probably have access
[2015/12/09 13:26:24] <brmbrmcar> OK.

[2015/12/09 14:38:35] <brmbrmcar> Yeah.
[2015/12/09 14:38:44] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/09 14:39:03] <brmbrmcar> I'll make the graphics now...
[2015/12/09 14:43:33] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Okay. Nothing complex though, remember.
[2015/12/09 14:43:41] <Karkus> Just a normal christmas hat.
[2015/12/09 14:43:45] <Karkus> Not a brmbrmhat.
[2015/12/09 14:46:34] <brmbrmcar> I am on the first one, as I had to install GIMP and I have soapy hands.
[2015/12/09 14:46:36] <maths22> Karkus: It pulls the Open Build Service download page, edits the DOM to insert Windows and OS X, and then serves it
[2015/12/09 14:47:08] <maths22> Therefore, if something goes wrong on the Open Build Service end, it won't work
[2015/12/09 14:50:26] <Karkus> maths22: Ah, okay
[2015/12/09 14:53:29] <brmbrmcar> 3 down, 15 to go.

[2015/12/09 15:55:28] <maths22> I would think the colors should somehow reflect the normal colors

[2015/12/10 03:40:25] <Tobbi> Sorry about that.
[2015/12/10 03:40:32] <Tobbi> I left my PC on.
[2015/12/10 03:40:34] <Tobbi> apparently.

[2015/12/10 08:55:53] <Tobbi> I'm gonna try flashing a Android M ROM now.
[2015/12/10 08:56:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: Elektrodenanschlusskabel
[2015/12/10 08:56:27] <head8debian> I need one. :D
[2015/12/10 08:56:31] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/12/10 08:57:11] <head8debian> Tobbi: It had german on the label, so i thought "oh, i will say it to Tobbi. :)
[2015/12/10 08:57:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: I keep getting these emails telling me i have to give people money...
[2015/12/10 08:57:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: You're Christian...
[2015/12/10 08:57:39] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/10 08:57:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: 8,500$ from one buisiness and 500$ from another...
[2015/12/10 08:57:49] <Tobbi> You have to give people money...
[2015/12/10 08:57:52] <Tobbi> and feel good about it.
[2015/12/10 08:57:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: So it must be spam.
[2015/12/10 08:58:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: They are trying to tell me that i bought that much from them. And never paid them.
[2015/12/10 08:58:23] <Tobbi> I see..
[2015/12/10 09:00:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: One does not simply walk into Elektrodenanschlusskabel.
[2015/12/10 09:00:11] <head8debian> Tobbi: Want me to send one to you? They all have these lovely javascript codes attached to them.
[2015/12/10 09:00:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: No thanks.
[2015/12/10 09:00:28] <head8debian> :D
[2015/12/10 09:00:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: OUCH! 1GB of updates today for arch.
[2015/12/10 09:00:51] <Tobbi> I'm trying to flash Android M...and it's gonna be difficult.
[2015/12/10 09:01:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Have fun. :D
[2015/12/10 09:01:16] <Tobbi> I most likely won't.
[2015/12/10 09:01:18] <head8debian> Tobbi: Why would it be dificult with a recovery?
[2015/12/10 09:01:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Because I need to transfer the file after clearing data/
[2015/12/10 09:01:41] <Tobbi> And I am kind of not sure how...I did it once...
[2015/12/10 09:01:46] <Tobbi> I can't remember.
[2015/12/10 09:01:49] <Tobbi> Probably try adb.
[2015/12/10 09:01:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: Arch had a C++ ABI change (whatever that means), so i figure thats why there is so much to download.
[2015/12/10 09:02:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: You need ABI...in order to get a good job here in Germany.
[2015/12/10 09:02:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Does your phone have a recovery enviroment?
[2015/12/10 09:02:31] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yes, and it's a tablet.
[2015/12/10 09:02:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: Then that shouldn't be too hard.
[2015/12/10 09:02:58] <Tobbi> I'll try...
[2015/12/10 09:02:59] <Tobbi> let's see..
[2015/12/10 09:03:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: Just dont delete your SD card.
[2015/12/10 09:03:06] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/12/10 09:03:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: I thought the data/ partition was the SD card?
[2015/12/10 09:03:17] <head8debian> Anyways, ive gotta go.

[2015/12/10 09:40:03] <Tobbi> It's now booting.
[2015/12/10 09:40:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: But when i reformat mine the SD card is not touched.
[2015/12/10 09:40:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/12/10 09:40:14] <Tobbi> Takes quite a long time.
[2015/12/10 09:40:23] <Tobbi> But my tablet is around 5 years old.
[2015/12/10 09:40:33] <Tobbi> Galaxy Tab 10.1
[2015/12/10 09:42:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: My phone is almost 6 years old.
[2015/12/10 09:42:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: It will be slow on the first bootup.
[2015/12/10 09:42:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: Your phone runs android?
[2015/12/10 09:42:58] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes, i flashed Cynanogenmod on it.

[2015/12/10 11:54:01] <Tobbi> Hello Karkus.
[2015/12/10 11:54:10] <Karkus> Hey Tobbi
[2015/12/10 11:56:05] <brmbrmcar> 1600 20th December Tobbi's time?
[2015/12/10 11:56:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: You need to be more careful when merging brmbrmcar's pull requests
[2015/12/10 11:56:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: I assume I should.
[2015/12/10 11:56:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: For some reason I thought that level content is so easy to understand that not a lot can break there.
[2015/12/10 11:57:19] <brmbrmcar> Will the changes I made be applied to the right level?
[2015/12/10 11:57:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: And that's where you're wrong :D
[2015/12/10 11:57:44] <brmbrmcar> Or will I havwe to do that "risky" pull request?
[2015/12/10 11:57:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: I will refrain from merging any more of brmbrmcar's pull requests.
[2015/12/10 11:58:21] <Tobbi> Otherwise my sanity might get impaired.
[2015/12/10 11:58:33] <brmbrmcar> So I essentially cannot contribute.
[2015/12/10 11:58:56] @ leyyin joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/10 11:59:01] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: No, you can. Just be careful, and test it first.
[2015/12/10 11:59:20] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/10 11:59:34] <Karkus> And then once each person on the team has fully tested it, we might consider merging it
[2015/12/10 11:59:45] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/10 11:59:50] <brmbrmcar> I was going to, before Tobbi said he would refrain from merging.
[2015/12/10 11:59:54] <Tobbi> Karkus: But only after running it through travis and coverity...
[2015/12/10 11:59:59] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/10 12:00:10] <brmbrmcar> How many people are there on  the team?#
[2015/12/10 12:00:11] <Tobbi> It's for the project's safety.
[2015/12/10 12:00:16] <Tobbi> It's just me.
[2015/12/10 12:00:17] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/10 12:00:24] <Karkus> Hey!
[2015/12/10 12:00:31] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/10 12:00:36] <Tobbi> I am kidding, obviously.
[2015/12/10 12:00:52] <Karkus> Well, tbh my commits amount to 2 for the actual game...
[2015/12/10 12:01:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: But the editor is equally important.
[2015/12/10 12:01:05] <brmbrmcar> I have 3.
[2015/12/10 12:01:06] <Tobbi> Especially in 10 days...
[2015/12/10 12:01:34] <Karkus> The editor is especially important on 20th?
[2015/12/10 12:01:52] <Tobbi> Karkus: I meant: After the release.
[2015/12/10 12:02:00] <Tobbi> Sorry, I am occupied with some other stuff currently.
[2015/12/10 12:02:18] <brmbrmcar> Flexlay is tough to use.
[2015/12/10 12:02:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah, I know
[2015/12/10 12:02:25] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Why?
[2015/12/10 12:02:44] <brmbrmcar> You can't just click and run...
[2015/12/10 12:03:14] <brmbrmcar> And unless people find your method, they would probably be clueess.
[2015/12/10 12:03:25] <Tobbi> Wasn't click'n'run added recently?
[2015/12/10 12:03:37] <Karkus> click and run the editor
[2015/12/10 12:03:44] <Tobbi> Ah!
[2015/12/10 12:03:57] <brmbrmcar> Really?
[2015/12/10 12:04:02] <brmbrmcar> Awesome!!!
[2015/12/10 12:04:05] <Karkus> No.
[2015/12/10 12:04:14] <Karkus> That's OS specific
[2015/12/10 12:04:18] <brmbrmcar> But I still prefer the other editor.
[2015/12/10 12:04:25] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Why?
[2015/12/10 12:04:27] <Tobbi> Yeah, that's something we might need to work on
[2015/12/10 12:05:23] <brmbrmcar> Because it has a more easy-to-use style,more features  and far less actual bugs once you can get it to start.
[2015/12/10 12:05:39] <Tobbi> We intend to change that for flexlay as well.
[2015/12/10 12:06:04] <Tobbi> Luckily, grumbel doesn't actually develop flexlay anymore, so there're no actual upstream changes we need to merge.
[2015/12/10 12:06:49] <brmbrmcar> To make flexlay better, it should have all the new features recently implemented.
[2015/12/10 12:07:12] <Karkus> This is called development.
[2015/12/10 12:07:13] <brmbrmcar> And allowoptions for EVERY object for EVERY thing.
[2015/12/10 12:07:27] <Karkus> err, what?
[2015/12/10 12:08:07] <brmbrmcar> Like to allow those badguy bonus blocks
[2015/12/10 12:08:18] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I don't think you realize how difficult it is to develop an editor in python.
[2015/12/10 12:08:22] <Tobbi> You may as well help us develop.
[2015/12/10 12:08:27] <Karkus> Are they separate objects?
[2015/12/10 12:08:28] <brmbrmcar> It won' work at all on the old one.
[2015/12/10 12:08:37] <brmbrmcar> Python?
[2015/12/10 12:08:49] <brmbrmcar> If a program is hard to use, change it.
[2015/12/10 12:09:17] <brmbrmcar> That is why I think the old editor is  better, because the improvements were easier.
[2015/12/10 12:09:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: What's the problem with Python?
[2015/12/10 12:09:33] <Tobbi> Karkus: I meant in general.
[2015/12/10 12:09:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: I meant developing from scratch in general.
[2015/12/10 12:09:50] <Tobbi> Sorry, but I am currently overseeing something...
[2015/12/10 12:09:57] <Tobbi> So, my mind is occupied with something else.
[2015/12/10 12:10:00] <brmbrmcar> I'll take a look, but I will probabky not have a clue.
[2015/12/10 12:10:02] <leyyin> do you need a Python developer?
[2015/12/10 12:10:15] <Karkus> Developing from scratch is easier, (albeit more time consuming)
[2015/12/10 12:10:31] <Karkus> leyyin: Yeah. Seen one?
[2015/12/10 12:10:37] <Karkus> Pass me the net
[2015/12/10 12:10:49] <leyyin> https://www.freelancer.com/ indians are pretty cheap :D
[2015/12/10 12:11:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: We do not accept donations. Ask hiker to get off whatever he's on and pass us some of the donations he gets.
[2015/12/10 12:11:34] <leyyin> man, once on meth, always on meth
[2015/12/10 12:11:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: Also, no indians. They scare the shit out of me.
[2015/12/10 12:11:37] <Karkus> leyyin: I don't pay for them, I tie them to a chair and make them program till their fingers bleed.
[2015/12/10 12:11:50] <brmbrmcar> Which file does all the stuff like deadscripts and sprites?
[2015/12/10 12:12:23] <leyyin> this channel is so quiet, the bot is ignored :P
[2015/12/10 12:12:55] <Karkus> The bot hasn't said anything since I joined.
[2015/12/10 12:13:16] <leyyin> nice, I see you removed all the old crap https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay
[2015/12/10 12:14:03] <Tobbi> leyyin: It's all Karkus's work.
[2015/12/10 12:14:21] <leyyin> did you run pep8 on the project? :P
[2015/12/10 12:14:31] <Karkus> I have to say, it takes a lot of skill to remove so much code.
[2015/12/10 12:14:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, but you may do so...
[2015/12/10 12:14:39] <Tobbi> And give us the results.
[2015/12/10 12:14:47] <Karkus> leyyin: Probably 0
[2015/12/10 12:15:03] <leyyin> 0 warning from pep8? ;)
[2015/12/10 12:15:05] <leyyin> wanna bet?
[2015/12/10 12:15:07] <Tobbi> I know that grumbel didn't check not too long ago (1 year ago)
[2015/12/10 12:15:09] <Karkus> No
[2015/12/10 12:15:20] <Tobbi> And that's very recent in SuperTux terms.
[2015/12/10 12:15:40] <Karkus> 0/10 for pep8 quality
[2015/12/10 12:15:41] <leyyin> is there a future where this version of flexlay will me merged upstream?
[2015/12/10 12:15:48] <leyyin> *be
[2015/12/10 12:15:51] <Karkus> Ask grumbel
[2015/12/10 12:16:05] <Karkus> leyyin: Have you run it?
[2015/12/10 12:16:10] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, in the future, the editor won't be open source anymore... :P We'll sell it for 19,90 EUR.
[2015/12/10 12:16:12] <leyyin> because it is a forked project, contributions will not go to your daily graph
[2015/12/10 12:16:34] <leyyin> Karkus, no, why? :D
[2015/12/10 12:16:34] <brmbrmcar> Any answer to my question? I cannot contribute if I don't understand gthe file layout.
[2015/12/10 12:16:34] <Karkus> leyyin: Ah, who cares?
[2015/12/10 12:16:40] <leyyin> Karkus, me :P
[2015/12/10 12:16:46] <leyyin> github is good for your CV
[2015/12/10 12:16:56] <Karkus> leyyin: It is?
[2015/12/10 12:17:05] <leyyin> YES :)
[2015/12/10 12:17:07] <Karkus> I wouldn't say I'm proud of Flexlay
[2015/12/10 12:17:21] <leyyin> you should be proud of whatever you got
[2015/12/10 12:17:32] <Karkus> Every line I write spagettifies it further
[2015/12/10 12:17:34] <Tobbi> leyyin: I don't think Google found me through Github...It's not the email address I have there.
[2015/12/10 12:17:45] <Not-e81f> [02flexlay] 07leyyin forked the repository - 13http://git.io/vIwY1
[2015/12/10 12:17:49] <Tobbi> Oh no!
[2015/12/10 12:17:57] <leyyin> what?
[2015/12/10 12:18:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: You forked, that means you're gonna complain about code style etc.
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <leyyin> don't tell me the bot said I forked the project?
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <Tobbi> Yes, it did
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <leyyin> if I run pep8 fixer on it, it should be good
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <Tobbi> Alright, go ahead, and submit a pull request.
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <brmbrmcar> Right, will you guys implement allthat?
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <Tobbi> what is "allthat"?
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <brmbrmcar> You cannot ask me to contribut if you don't tell me a thing.
[2015/12/10 12:19:38] <leyyin> .git directory is 38 MB :D
[2015/12/10 12:19:41] <leyyin> garbage
[2015/12/10 12:19:51] <brmbrmcar> Trash it.
[2015/12/10 12:19:54] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: It's not our fault if you're so annoying everyone has you on ignore.
[2015/12/10 12:19:55] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/10 12:20:05] <leyyin> who are you talking to?
[2015/12/10 12:20:08] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/10 12:20:29] <brmbrmcar> You didn;t answer my question.
[2015/12/10 12:20:53] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.
[2015/12/10 12:20:54] <brmbrmcar> Just tha I cannot unti I know what do do!
[2015/12/10 12:23:21] <leyyin> oh boy, pycharm is processing, this means it has a lot of files :D
[2015/12/10 12:23:31] <leyyin> only 124 files :D
[2015/12/10 12:25:04] <maths22> Tobbi: Could you create an account on the wiki for me?
[2015/12/10 12:25:13] <Tobbi> maths22: I believe so, one moment.
[2015/12/10 12:25:17] <maths22> Tobbi: Thanks!
[2015/12/10 12:27:14] <Karkus> leyyin: I didn't make this, it was grumbel.
[2015/12/10 12:27:27] <leyyin> yeah, no problems :P
[2015/12/10 12:27:41] <Karkus> So don't bully me
[2015/12/10 12:28:08] <Karkus> leyyin: Also, Pycharm is great
[2015/12/10 12:29:16] <Karkus> leyyin: How can I decrease the size of the .git folder?
[2015/12/10 12:29:25] <leyyin> you can't
[2015/12/10 12:29:30] <leyyin> want to modify history? ;)
[2015/12/10 12:30:05] <Tobbi> I'd rather not.
[2015/12/10 12:30:47] <maths22> Tobbi: You'd rather not what?
[2015/12/10 12:31:11] <Tobbi> maths22: modify history.
[2015/12/10 12:31:14] <Karkus> Can I remove WW2?
[2015/12/10 12:31:24] <leyyin> remove hitler
[2015/12/10 12:31:26] <leyyin> sure why not
[2015/12/10 12:32:08] <maths22> I would agree that it is generally inadvisible to modify history
[2015/12/10 12:32:21] <Tobbi> Check PM, maths22
[2015/12/10 12:32:26] <maths22> No one wants to experience the grandfather paradox first-hand
[2015/12/10 12:38:32] <brmbrmcar> The wiki Downloads should mention the nightly builds.
[2015/12/10 12:38:38] <Karkus> leyyin: Have you run pep8 on it?
[2015/12/10 12:38:43] <brmbrmcar> But I cannot access the page.
[2015/12/10 12:38:53] <Karkus> So should the website Downloads page
[2015/12/10 12:39:44] <brmbrmcar> Yeah, but in both cases mention that they mostly do not work.
[2015/12/10 12:39:45] <leyyin> a sec, busy with something else
[2015/12/10 12:39:56] <brmbrmcar> Without severe adjustment.
[2015/12/10 12:41:10] <maths22> These will be updated once I am satisfied with both the quality of the builds (which I think I am) and the download process/page (which I am not quite yet satisfied with)
[2015/12/10 12:42:03] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/10 12:42:05] <maths22> brmbrmcar: What do you mean about not working?
[2015/12/10 12:42:17] <brmbrmcar> The debs won't work at all.
[2015/12/10 12:42:37] <brmbrmcar> I tried it with a fresh Ubuntu install, nothing either.
[2015/12/10 12:42:42] <maths22> brmbrmcar: that's the OBS half that needs help
[2015/12/10 12:42:52] <Not-e81f> [02flexlay] 07Karkus476 pushed 031 commit to 03develop [+1/-1/Â±0] 13http://git.io/v0feQ

[2015/12/10 12:43:53] <brmbrmcar> What is OBS?
[2015/12/10 12:44:17] <maths22> Open Build Service: the system used to make the linux packages
[2015/12/10 12:44:23] <Karkus> I think Git is a great invention, but does anyone really need the whole history of an application?
[2015/12/10 12:45:18] <brmbrmcar> Ah, OK.
[2015/12/10 12:45:32] <maths22> Karkus: Probably not.  I personally liked the SVN model more, but it isn't perfect either
[2015/12/10 12:45:38] <brmbrmcar> I hate the way git ust overloads disk space.
[2015/12/10 12:46:01] <Karkus> How much disk space do you have, brmbrmcar?
[2015/12/10 12:46:45] <maths22> Interestingly, for 99% text-based repositories, a git clone may be about the same size as a full SVN checkout (i.e brlcad, which is currently on revision 66757)
[2015/12/10 12:47:03] <maths22> The full (compressed) history is actually about the same size as the SVN clean copy it creates
[2015/12/10 12:47:19] <Karkus> I don't understand SVN
[2015/12/10 12:47:28] <brmbrmcar> 3.5gb, try not to go below 2
[2015/12/10 12:47:37] <brmbrmcar> 9gb ssd.
[2015/12/10 12:47:48] <Karkus> What computer are you on?
[2015/12/10 12:47:53] <Karkus> A gameboy
[2015/12/10 12:47:54] <Karkus> ?
[2015/12/10 12:47:57] <maths22> Karkus: What about it don't you understand?
[2015/12/10 12:48:08] <brmbrmcar> Acer Chromebook 11
[2015/12/10 12:48:23] <Karkus> With 9Gb?
[2015/12/10 12:48:51] <Karkus> maths22: Well, which one is better in regards of size?
[2015/12/10 12:49:06] <brmbrmcar> They advertise 16, but even after complete developer reset only gets 9.
[2015/12/10 12:49:25] @ Hume2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/10 12:49:53] <Karkus> My Laptop has 1Tb
[2015/12/10 12:50:03] <brmbrmcar> 1tb is sill old.
[2015/12/10 12:50:21] <Karkus> Huh?
[2015/12/10 12:50:23] <maths22> Karkus: It depends.  For example, SVN would take up less space for SuperTux by a reasonable amount
[2015/12/10 12:50:37] <maths22> It would use about 166 + 166 MB for a full checkout
[2015/12/10 12:50:39] <brmbrmcar> 2tb is the new standard.
[2015/12/10 12:50:55] <maths22> (It stores a clean copy uncompressed along with the working copy)
[2015/12/10 12:51:00] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Yes, but all I'm saying is I'm not complaining
[2015/12/10 12:51:05] <maths22> Git is 484
[2015/12/10 12:51:15] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/10 12:51:20] <maths22> (Note that these numbers are based on some old revision, but it doesn't matter too much)
[2015/12/10 12:51:34] <jesusalva> 250 GB here. ;)
[2015/12/10 12:51:50] <maths22> The reason is that we have a good amount of binary files (in data) which compress poorly and where delta-style histories don't work
[2015/12/10 12:52:04] <Karkus> That's barely enough for windows jesusalva
[2015/12/10 12:52:09] <brmbrmcar> I have a terrible computer.
[2015/12/10 12:52:11] <jesusalva> I don't use windows.
[2015/12/10 12:52:16] <maths22> To some extent, this is probably why STK does a svn repo for data and a git repo for the code
[2015/12/10 12:52:25] <jesusalva> My Windows have bare minimum space.
[2015/12/10 12:52:27] <maths22> (Not that I recommend that approach, but it has its advantages)
[2015/12/10 12:52:39] <jesusalva> It also haves an android.
[2015/12/10 12:52:48] <jesusalva> Which I don't use, by the way.
[2015/12/10 12:53:20] <maths22> I should do the CPackSource stuff.  Soon...
[2015/12/10 12:53:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: Your commit with the tilesets doesn't write it to the file.
[2015/12/10 12:53:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know.
[2015/12/10 12:54:01] <Tobbi> But that has never worked.
[2015/12/10 12:54:21] <Karkus> No, we never had tilesets implemented.
[2015/12/10 12:54:35] <Karkus> properly
[2015/12/10 12:54:41] <Hume2> I'll just reconnect.
[2015/12/10 12:54:44] @ Quit: Hume2: Quit: Page closed
[2015/12/10 12:55:02] <jesusalva> ops, sorry, this netbook haves 320GB. My good notebook is the one of 250 GB. It's 40 GB to windows, 5GB for android, 5 GB for swap, and 100 GB for home and other 100 GB for root.
[2015/12/10 12:55:32] <jesusalva> Which sums up to 250 anyway. So I rounded /home and / space.
[2015/12/10 12:55:50] @ Hume2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/10 12:57:17] <brmbrmcar> Anyway, I have virtually no disk space. :D
[2015/12/10 12:58:41] <maths22> I realized that the biggest part of our downloads are actually the music files.
[2015/12/10 12:58:52] <maths22> Not that there is anything to do about that fact, but it is kind of interesting
[2015/12/10 12:58:56] <maths22> (Images come in 2nd)
[2015/12/10 12:59:28] <Hume2> There are many useless images.
[2015/12/10 12:59:58] <brmbrmcar> Like my sprites for *** *** ***s?
[2015/12/10 13:00:16] <brmbrmcar> I haven't implemented thedm, luckily.
[2015/12/10 13:00:30] <brmbrmcar> And they have no license.
[2015/12/10 13:00:45] <Hume2> No, I mean the phone.
[2015/12/10 13:00:47] <Tobbi> I have no idea what the hell you're talking about.
[2015/12/10 13:00:55] <Hume2> tele-phone

[2015/12/10 13:03:50] <maths22> Wow-that did not paste well at all.  Sorry :(
[2015/12/10 13:04:03] <Hume2> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/images/objects/bonus_block/info_block.png
[2015/12/10 13:04:05] <maths22> The thing about the levels is that they compress very well
[2015/12/10 13:04:31] <maths22> Hume2: What was that supposed to be used for?
[2015/12/10 13:05:07] <Hume2> maths22: I think that this was supposed to be an info block, but it's now not used anywhere at all.
[2015/12/10 13:05:32] <brmbrmcar> I like it.
[2015/12/10 13:05:37] <Tobbi> A small image doesn't make a big difference.
[2015/12/10 13:05:47] <brmbrmcar> It could be an easter egg somewhere...
[2015/12/10 13:05:51] <Tobbi> Besides, I wasn't allowed to compress with imageoptim...
[2015/12/10 13:05:58] <Tobbi> otherwise, people will complain again.
[2015/12/10 13:06:16] <maths22> Tobbi: Can you share whatever script you used to do that?
[2015/12/10 13:06:17] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/10 13:06:17] <brmbrmcar> Think that is a good idea?
[2015/12/10 13:06:24] <Tobbi> maths22: It was a program...
[2015/12/10 13:06:25] <maths22> I'll make it part of the release (not debug) build process
[2015/12/10 13:06:27] <Tobbi> ImageOptim.
[2015/12/10 13:06:30] <maths22> :(
[2015/12/10 13:06:47] <Hume2> It's true that the majority of images are used somewhere.
[2015/12/10 13:06:47] <Tobbi> maths22: You might be able to compress with Zopfli...
[2015/12/10 13:06:54] <Tobbi> iirc, it's a google image compressor thing.
[2015/12/10 13:07:25] <Tobbi> maths22: https://github.com/google/zopfli
[2015/12/10 13:07:32] <maths22> All of the images we care about are PNGs, right?
[2015/12/10 13:07:46] <Tobbi> maths22: https://imageoptim.com/
[2015/12/10 13:07:54] <Tobbi> maths22: If I recall correctly, yes.
[2015/12/10 13:07:58] <maths22> :( some of the backgrounds are jpgs
[2015/12/10 13:08:06] <maths22> i.e. https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/images/background/cave2.jpg
[2015/12/10 13:08:34] <brmbrmcar> info_block has no sprite.
[2015/12/10 13:08:48] <brmbrmcar> Am I permitted to make one?
[2015/12/10 13:09:34] <Tobbi> info_block?
[2015/12/10 13:09:45] <maths22> There are 30 jpgs (including the credit images) and 1941 pngs.  I think I'll worry about the pngs
[2015/12/10 13:10:25] <brmbrmcar> You know, the phone!
[2015/12/10 13:10:46] <brmbrmcar> But it is cxalled info_block!
[2015/12/10 13:11:37] <brmbrmcar> I hate jpeg!
[2015/12/10 13:14:37] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Please, don't. I guess, we'll remove it one nice day.
[2015/12/10 13:14:55] <Tobbi> for god's sake, we're 10 days before a release
[2015/12/10 13:15:00] <Tobbi> Don't make drastic changes now.
[2015/12/10 13:15:35] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2015/12/10 13:15:50] <brmbrmcar> I guess you all hate my hats?
[2015/12/10 13:15:53] <Hume2> It's not used in any sprite, so it can't do any harm.
[2015/12/10 13:16:17] @ Quit: tuxdev_: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2015/12/10 13:16:29] <brmbrmcar> I wouldn't remove info_block, as it might upset someone who liked it. :D
[2015/12/10 13:16:47] <Hume2> Let's see...
[2015/12/10 13:17:39] <Hume2> It was before the year 2005.
[2015/12/10 13:18:13] <Hume2> It has been never used in any stable release.
[2015/12/10 13:18:39] <Hume2> Searching info_block.png in /data... 0 results.

[2015/12/10 13:19:13] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It's useless!
[2015/12/10 13:19:26] <brmbrmcar> For an info block!
[2015/12/10 13:19:40] <brmbrmcar> That is what it is designed for!
[2015/12/10 13:19:50] <brmbrmcar> I am making it useful!
[2015/12/10 13:20:15] <Hume2> So I need help, so I'll use the phone.
[2015/12/10 13:20:32] <Hume2> I don't know any number, so I just type something.
[2015/12/10 13:21:05] <Hume2> And I don't even need to speak and someone tells me a help without the need of knowing who I am.
[2015/12/10 13:21:47] <Hume2> And the random number even knows what to help me with.
[2015/12/10 13:22:32] <Hume2> Yes. And I can find a telephone in an icy wasteland, where's no electricity.
[2015/12/10 13:22:46] <Hume2> And what is more, it's working!
[2015/12/10 13:25:13] <Hume2> Isn't it a nice way of phoning? I bump into the telephone and it starts phoning!
[2015/12/10 13:26:59] <Karkus> Tobbi: What's the develop branch for?
[2015/12/10 13:27:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: I didn't create it.
[2015/12/10 13:27:27] <Tobbi> I believe it was grumbel.

[2015/12/10 13:42:26] <brmbrmcar> I can tell you I am old enough for a GitHub account.
[2015/12/10 13:42:31] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You attend a high school.
[2015/12/10 13:42:36] <Tobbi> See.
[2015/12/10 13:42:50] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: one of your commits contain your high school e-mail address.
[2015/12/10 13:42:55] <Tobbi> Ergo...
[2015/12/10 13:43:11] <brmbrmcar> I wanna trash that.
[2015/12/10 13:43:20] <brmbrmcar> I disconnected it!
[2015/12/10 13:43:21] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You won't get a chance.
[2015/12/10 13:43:45] <Tobbi> You might have disconnected that e-mail, but you won't get a chance to trash it.
[2015/12/10 13:44:08] <brmbrmcar> I sould probably have faked it, as the school servers are easy to fake.
[2015/12/10 13:44:49] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: But still, I just wanted to tell you to stop this tomfoolery.
[2015/12/10 13:44:56] <Tobbi> It gets on our collective nerves.
[2015/12/10 13:48:49] <brmbrmcar> Should I dos the school servers?
[2015/12/10 13:53:13] <leyyin> Tobbi, so he is in highschool :D

[2015/12/10 13:53:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes, he is.
[2015/12/10 13:53:41] <Tobbi> I assumed as much already.
[2015/12/10 13:57:55] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/12/10 14:00:39] <Hume2> LOL, I thought that he's 11.
[2015/12/10 14:01:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Your surrounded by a bunch of high schoolers. :)
[2015/12/10 14:01:20] <brmbrmcar> OK now. Joke's over.
[2015/12/10 14:01:40] <Tobbi> I know.
[2015/12/10 14:05:11] <head8debian> Tobbi: You don't have a GPG key?
[2015/12/10 14:06:00] <leyyin> you use google test?

[2015/12/10 14:12:50] <leyyin> I apparently broke the editor, lemme fix the issue
[2015/12/10 14:14:15] <leyyin> ha, Christmas music :D
[2015/12/10 14:14:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: It's nice christmas music.
[2015/12/10 14:15:36] <brmbrmcar> What Vhristmas music?
[2015/12/10 14:15:37] <leyyin> I got sucked into the game :D
[2015/12/10 14:16:04] <brmbrmcar> At school they used an inappropriate song in an English lesson.
[2015/12/10 14:16:12] <brmbrmcar> Achristas son.
[2015/12/10 14:17:03] <leyyin> wait, supertux does not come with all the locales?
[2015/12/10 14:17:09] <leyyin> I have to download an addon?
[2015/12/10 14:17:28] <leyyin> this is new :D
[2015/12/10 14:17:33] <brmbrmcar> Ithink the language packs are for addons...
[2015/12/10 14:18:05] <leyyin> I am confused, there is in the language list, I did not install the language pack
[2015/12/10 14:18:10] <leyyin> so what is the diference?
[2015/12/10 14:18:57] <brmbrmcar> Er... I think language pac translates other stuff.
[2015/12/10 14:19:35] <Hume2> The christmas music is good except the tuc tuc thing.
[2015/12/10 14:21:31] <brmbrmcar> Tuc tuc?
[2015/12/10 14:21:44] <Hume2> I hate tuc tuc.
[2015/12/10 14:21:45] <maths22> leyyin: The .txt is need to make the windows builder happy.  We can get rid of the no-extension one
[2015/12/10 14:21:52] @ Quit: Tobbi: Ping timeout: 256 seconds
[2015/12/10 14:22:16] <maths22> Either WIX or NSIS (or maybe both) wanted the license file to have an extension, so I gave it one.
[2015/12/10 14:24:36] <jesusalva> ...As far as I know, COPYING file haves a MIME type of it's own.
[2015/12/10 14:24:52] <maths22> I have the feeling that, after this release, we need to make this language pack stuff clearer.
[2015/12/10 14:25:02] <maths22> Also, what does a language pack actually provide?
[2015/12/10 14:25:19] * jesusalva agrees 'cause he never heard about this language pack before.
[2015/12/10 14:25:23] <jesusalva> And I am a translator.
[2015/12/10 14:25:49] <maths22> jesusalva: I just looked at one of them-it appears to be translations for addons
[2015/12/10 14:26:23] <maths22> One of my projects for after this release is a better addon management backend-I think I will incorporate translations into that
[2015/12/10 14:26:35] <maths22> The translations should end up packaged with the addon, not separately
[2015/12/10 14:26:39] <jesusalva> I never saw, and this is first time I heard of. I only know that on Transifex I can translate the addons.
[2015/12/10 14:26:50] <jesusalva> maths22: I agree with that, though.
[2015/12/10 14:27:23] <jesusalva> No sense downloading the addon and translation separately. It seems like there is no translation after downloading the extra-level.
[2015/12/10 14:27:25] <maths22> Also, does anyone know why pressing alt in the menu acts like pressing enter?
[2015/12/10 14:28:14] <brmbrmcar> I want to know why both control and the action key work for making the earth Tux invincible...
[2015/12/10 14:29:35] <leyyin> wth, something is wrong with these imports O_O
[2015/12/10 14:30:20] <brmbrmcar> It doesn't any more.
[2015/12/10 14:35:32] <leyyin> ah, stupid python modules

[2015/12/10 16:25:46] <Tobbi> maths22: It is possible to package translations with add-ons. Problem is you need to update the add-on...
[2015/12/10 16:25:53] <Tobbi> when you only want to update translations.
[2015/12/10 16:26:18] <Tobbi> I agree we need to make that stuff clearer...
[2015/12/10 16:29:10] <maths22> Tobbi: This whole process will be improved with a better addon management system

[2015/12/10 16:30:04] <maths22> We will see...
[2015/12/10 16:31:26] <Tobbi> maths22: What I would like to have is periodic update checks and informing the user about add-on updates etc.

[2015/12/10 16:37:09] <brmbrmcar> And also, fire is primary, and people cannot complain about there not being christmas hats for the other pwerups.

[2015/12/10 16:39:33] <brmbrmcar> It's just wierd not to change anything for the other flowers.
[2015/12/10 16:39:47] <Tobbi> It just doesn't match the christmas theme.
[2015/12/10 16:39:58] <Tobbi> But maybe I am the only one who thinks like that.
[2015/12/10 16:40:30] <head8debian> I personally think there is only 1 type of santa hat that seems to fit.
[2015/12/10 16:40:32] <brmbrmcar> Some people say "Santa used to be green".
[2015/12/10 16:40:42] <head8debian> Inverting the colors would be weird.
[2015/12/10 16:40:56] <head8debian> People would be like "Wha is that"?
[2015/12/10 16:41:09] <brmbrmcar> I sort of looks christmassy.

[2015/12/10 17:27:28] <maths22> I fixed it so the user should not need to install anything extra

[2015/12/11 08:41:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/12/11 08:41:54] <head8debian> Good morning jesusalva. :)
[2015/12/11 08:42:27] <jesusalva> Good morning as well head8debian. Almost midday, lucky I didn't needed to say 'afternoon' ;) :)
[2015/12/11 08:42:38] <head8debian> jesusalva: Haha.
[2015/12/11 08:42:53] <head8debian> jesusalva: I can never say good morning to Tobbi and be correct in his time...
[2015/12/11 08:43:06] <Tobbi> that is true.
[2015/12/11 08:43:37] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/12/11 08:43:41] <jesusalva> Let's say that when I'm on breakfast at 07:00, Tobbi would be lunching at midday (except they lunch at 14 usually)
[2015/12/11 08:44:03] <Tobbi> I lunch at 11:30 currently.
[2015/12/11 08:44:08] <jesusalva> And I eat breakfast at 06:30 on usual as well. Except I'm on vacations right ow.
[2015/12/11 08:44:08] <Tobbi> And don't have breakfast.
[2015/12/11 08:44:21] <Tobbi> jesusalva: How is l10n coming?
[2015/12/11 08:44:31] <jesusalva> Tobbi: Cool, then you lunch almost exactly when I breakfast.
[2015/12/11 08:44:36] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/11 08:44:38] <jesusalva> Lemme see.
[2015/12/11 08:44:42] <Tobbi> It is breakfast for me.
[2015/12/11 08:45:10] <head8debian>  jesusalva Tobbi gets up late though. ;)
[2015/12/11 08:45:11] <jesusalva> Wie spÃ¤t ist es?
[2015/12/11 08:45:21] <Tobbi> jesusalva: almost 3pm
[2015/12/11 08:45:29] <Tobbi> jesusalva: Ich meinte: Fast 15 Uhr.
[2015/12/11 08:45:59] <Tobbi> jesusalva: pt-BR only has 154 strings left to translate.
[2015/12/11 08:46:01] <jesusalva> Then there is 14:42, here is 11:42, and head8debian should be... 09:42?
[2015/12/11 08:46:28] <jesusalva> Tobbi: And a very lazy translator... ;)
[2015/12/11 08:46:53] <jesusalva> I've been busy doing strategic and tactical plannings for my alliance on my game.
[2015/12/11 08:47:41] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/11 08:47:44] <jesusalva> Now, there is only the following levels with pendences: CT, LMH, Christian, Lolkats and Michael.
[2015/12/11 08:48:03] <jesusalva> Only addons, not so much hard.
[2015/12/11 08:48:11] <Tobbi> right
[2015/12/11 08:48:16] <jesusalva> head8debian, how much 'till release?
[2015/12/11 08:49:33] * jesusalva checks for the one with least strings untranslated.
[2015/12/11 08:49:59] <jesusalva> CTs or Michaels wins. Michael wasn't translated a single string yet, so I vote for CT in order to keep consistency.
[2015/12/11 08:50:30] <jesusalva> Odd.
[2015/12/11 08:51:15] <Tobbi> jesusalva: It was added fairly late.
[2015/12/11 08:51:23] <jesusalva> Tobbi: Is src/ctdabomb-worldmaps/levels/penny/10-lastnight.stl:3 level name properly formatted? "Last night for penny" -> "Last Night for Penny"
[2015/12/11 08:51:32] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2015/12/11 08:51:50] <Tobbi> jesusalva: i really don't know...
[2015/12/11 08:51:55] <Tobbi> It was CT who did that.
[2015/12/11 08:52:33] <jesusalva> Yes, but assuming that must levels have capitalization on first letter for each word, shouldn't there be a comment that the capitalization is intended?
[2015/12/11 08:53:08] <jesusalva> 70% of the levels on ST (or more) actually would say "Last Night for Penny" instead.
[2015/12/11 08:53:26] <Tobbi> jesusalva: We should add that to translator notices.
[2015/12/11 08:54:12] <jesusalva> So LOOOONG and Hard You Will Wish You Never Found It. --> Cool level name. ;)
[2015/12/11 08:55:11] <jesusalva> On other channel people were talking about open source economics. Almost gave me headache their price marking methods.
[2015/12/11 08:55:12] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/11 08:55:53] <jesusalva> ...Now, let's open Google Translator. Why would I try to remember what is "Moat" when Google Translator does it for me? ;)
[2015/12/11 09:02:13] <jesusalva> Funny language for "src/ctdabomb-worldmaps/levels/penny/extro.stl:3" name
[2015/12/11 09:05:08] <jesusalva> CT's levels fully translated, now I'll play something else before looking again at the untranslated resources.
[2015/12/11 09:20:59] <head8debian> jesusalva: 9 days?
[2015/12/11 09:21:17] <jesusalva> Did you already -figlet'ed it?
[2015/12/11 09:21:20] <jesusalva> :)
[2015/12/11 09:21:24] <head8debian> jesusalva: No. :)
[2015/12/11 09:21:28] <head8debian> jesusalva: You can though. :D
[2015/12/11 09:22:39] <jesusalva> -figlet 9 days!

[2015/12/11 10:52:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Good idea.
[2015/12/11 10:52:57] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/12/11 10:53:04] <brmbrmcar> Do blogs.
[2015/12/11 10:53:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: How about chinese electronics teardowns? :D You pay for them and i will tear them appart. :D

[2015/12/11 10:55:54] <leyyin> when you see lower case 'i' in english, what do you think?
[2015/12/11 10:55:59] <leyyin> it's another meaning than I ?
[2015/12/11 10:56:02] <head8debian> How awkward it would be if we all met in person...
[2015/12/11 10:56:23] <head8debian> leyyin: Someone doesn't use the shift key enough.
[2015/12/11 10:57:00] <brmbrmcar> +i = invisible
[2015/12/11 10:57:07] <leyyin> head8debian, I told you, if you come to eastern Europe, you will be rich :P
[2015/12/11 10:57:10] <leyyin> and meet me
[2015/12/11 10:57:19] <head8debian> leyyin: I don't want to meet you. :D
[2015/12/11 10:58:03] <brmbrmcar> My age of 1 would creep you all out. :D
[2015/12/11 10:58:25] <leyyin> why not ;)
[2015/12/11 10:58:26] <brmbrmcar> I promised I'd stop.
[2015/12/11 11:00:20] <brmbrmcar> But in Europe, you can go around without fear of guns in the wrong hands! Amazing!
[2015/12/11 11:00:47] <head8debian> I have more fear of them being in the wrong hands over there.
[2015/12/11 11:00:59] <leyyin> 'them' ?
[2015/12/11 11:01:00] <brmbrmcar> Yes. Exactly.
[2015/12/11 11:01:19] <brmbrmcar> You are missing out in the lack of guns.
[2015/12/11 11:01:43] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Me and leyyin were just talkign about that...
[2015/12/11 11:01:58] <brmbrmcar> Really?
[2015/12/11 11:02:06] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: So, do you think that guns shoudl be banned completely, or let people have the freely?
[2015/12/11 11:02:08] <leyyin> who is 'them' ?
[2015/12/11 11:02:09] <brmbrmcar> I'll re-check the trees.
[2015/12/11 11:02:16] <brmbrmcar> I hate guns.
[2015/12/11 11:02:20] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: It was in #stk...
[2015/12/11 11:02:23] <brmbrmcar> They are useless.
[2015/12/11 11:02:39] <leyyin> head8debian, you know there is a middle ground, not black and white ;)
[2015/12/11 11:03:24] <head8debian> bbl.
[2015/12/11 11:05:13] <Tobbi> head8debian: I think we'd be annoyed if we met each other in person, but maybe if we accept donations...
[2015/12/11 11:05:59] <brmbrmcar> Why aren't there donations?
[2015/12/11 11:06:04] <brmbrmcar> Oh,yeah.
[2015/12/11 11:06:11] <head8debian> Tobbi: :-)
[2015/12/11 11:06:39] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: We have no one who want to accept the responsability to take care of it.
[2015/12/11 11:06:48] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2015/12/11 11:07:01] <brmbrmcar> Anyone out there?
[2015/12/11 11:07:39] <brmbrmcar> Who wants to do it?
[2015/12/11 11:08:17] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: No one does.
[2015/12/11 11:08:26] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: We have no need for money either.
[2015/12/11 11:08:50] <head8debian> Unless we are going to hire a part time dev to replace Tobbi...
[2015/12/11 11:08:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/11 11:09:18] <head8debian> Tobbi: That was the exact response i was expecting. :D
[2015/12/11 11:09:27] <Tobbi> head8debian: No one can replace me.
[2015/12/11 11:09:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: I know you too well... :p
[2015/12/11 11:09:35] <Tobbi> You know that sign that is hanging above my bed.
[2015/12/11 11:09:36] <head8debian> True.
[2015/12/11 11:09:43] <head8debian> Huh?
[2015/12/11 11:10:16] <brmbrmcar> How much do you pay?
[2015/12/11 11:10:25] <Tobbi> head8debian: "complains about me are most likely the sign that there's something wrong with the person having problems with me"
[2015/12/11 11:10:27] <brmbrmcar> I wanna 8 figure salary.
[2015/12/11 11:11:37] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: I want enough to pretty comfortably live off of, but i don't want to work my butt off in the proccess...
[2015/12/11 11:12:07] <brmbrmcar> Yeah.
[2015/12/11 11:12:35] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: When i raise a family i'd like to spend time with them, not be gone all the time.
[2015/12/11 11:12:37] <brmbrmcar> I want enough dosh for another computer.
[2015/12/11 11:12:43] <brmbrmcar> Yeah.
[2015/12/11 11:13:17] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: I have a old desktop which you can have if you come get it. :D
[2015/12/11 11:13:27] <brmbrmcar> Nah.
[2015/12/11 11:13:36] <brmbrmcar> This is fast enough.
[2015/12/11 11:13:50] <brmbrmcar> I am talking 5ghz AMD.
[2015/12/11 11:14:12] <brmbrmcar> That's what I want, not what I've got.
[2015/12/11 11:14:31] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: It would be better than a chromebook.
[2015/12/11 11:14:58] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/12/11 11:14:58] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: 250gb HDD, 4gb ram, dual core 1.86ghz c2d.
[2015/12/11 11:15:27] <brmbrmcar> Mine has less ram but more proccessing.

[2015/12/11 11:15:51] <brmbrmcar> And also, Chromebooks just turn out faster than devices of a similay spec.
[2015/12/11 11:16:00] <brmbrmcar> I have 2.4ghzintel.

[2015/12/11 11:17:00] <brmbrmcar> Mine is slightly different UK spec.
[2015/12/11 11:17:48] <brmbrmcar> This machine is 64 bit.
[2015/12/11 11:29:38] * jesusalva thinks that money is probably only worth spending on food.
[2015/12/11 11:36:11] <brmbrmcar> Why?

[2015/12/11 12:25:22] @ bb010g joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/11 12:26:17] <brmbrmcar> Ihave a relatively new computer.
[2015/12/11 12:27:08] <brmbrmcar> Anyone with 1 bitcoin?
[2015/12/11 12:27:16] <brmbrmcar> OK, 0.5 bitcoins...
[2015/12/11 12:27:16] * jesusalva looks
[2015/12/11 12:27:39] <jesusalva> My friend hasn't reached even 0.01 yet.
[2015/12/11 12:27:45] <jesusalva> (or hadn't)
[2015/12/11 12:27:55] <jesusalva> I have no idea of what this exactly is about...
[2015/12/11 12:28:08] <brmbrmcar> Come on, broken microphone, perfectly good computer, 0.5 bitcoins.
[2015/12/11 12:28:33] <jesusalva> head8debian: In what else would you spend money, head8debian, which is not food or ways to do more money to buy more food?
[2015/12/11 12:29:02] <jesusalva> As bible says... "Why do [...] you spend your money on what is not bread [food]?"
[2015/12/11 12:29:20] <brmbrmcar> What about liquid?
[2015/12/11 12:29:41] <jesusalva> brmbrmcar: If the microphone is broken, then the good computer is not perfectly.
[2015/12/11 12:29:47] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2015/12/11 12:30:02] <brmbrmcar> So 0.49 bitoins?
[2015/12/11 12:30:47] * jesusalva needs to do physical exercises.
[2015/12/11 12:30:59] <jesusalva> But instead, he sits on computer and starts chatting on IRC.
[2015/12/11 12:31:07] <brmbrmcar> 4913 laps of the marathon!
[2015/12/11 12:31:50] <jesusalva> i=0 ; while i >= 4913: { lap() ; i+=1 };
[2015/12/11 12:32:17] <jesusalva> s/>=/<=
[2015/12/11 12:35:07] <brmbrmcar> Correct. I am glad you stuck an equals sign there!
[2015/12/11 12:35:21] <brmbrmcar> i = 4913 laps!!!
[2015/12/11 12:39:54] <jesusalva> so, if i=mcÂ², then a body with mass $brmbrmcar controls time at light resulting in speed 2brmbrmcar, and if there are 2brmbrmcar the cntrols 2 time at 2lights resulting in speed 4brmbrmcar which provokes an ERR_Tobbi...
[2015/12/11 12:41:00] <jesusalva> Which invokes a SIGSEGV and the time crashes. Only the space is left, but with no time, there is no speed, with no speed, there is no brmbrmcar, and if no brmbrmcar, the timespace layer collapses and only Tobbi remains.
[2015/12/11 12:41:09] <jesusalva> See? Einsten's formula.
[2015/12/11 12:42:20] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2015/12/11 12:42:31] <brmbrmcar> Nut is Einstein right?
[2015/12/11 12:42:44] * jesusalva Sidecomments: It may be no fun when you read it, but it certainly was to write it. ;)
[2015/12/11 12:42:56] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2015/12/11 12:43:01] * jesusalva /who Nut
[2015/12/11 12:43:02] <brmbrmcar> It was fun to read!
[2015/12/11 12:43:13] <brmbrmcar> I meant But.
[2015/12/11 12:44:20] <brmbrmcar> I have a formua.
[2015/12/11 12:44:32] <jesusalva> Tell us.
[2015/12/11 12:44:32] <brmbrmcar> For working out your exercise.
[2015/12/11 12:47:00] <brmbrmcar> Mass in kg*energy in Kcal daily/(4913/running speed in kmh)=time running needed to recover.
[2015/12/11 12:47:28] <brmbrmcar> It currently only works for running, but I imagine swimming would be similar.
[2015/12/11 12:48:53] <brmbrmcar> In a week.
[2015/12/11 12:49:52] <jesusalva> Hm. 40*2000/(4913/4) = 80000/1228.25 = 65.13 h * kg * kcal/km
[2015/12/11 12:50:11] <jesusalva> So I take 65.13 brmbrmcars to recover. Am I correct?
[2015/12/11 12:50:48] <jesusalva> Time mass and energy / space. Or Eisten's formula/space.
[2015/12/11 12:51:26] <jesusalva> ...Using previous formula, the final result is [brmbrmcar/Tobbi] ?
[2015/12/11 12:51:31] <brmbrmcar> Ooh.
[2015/12/11 12:51:36] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2015/12/11 12:51:44] <brmbrmcar> Traffic!!!
[2015/12/11 12:53:16] <brmbrmcar> What is your favourite excercise?
[2015/12/11 12:59:42] <jesusalva> ...Typing and thinking. I'm thinking. I was thinking. Still thinking. When thinking is stopped, the person has gone mad or dead.

[2015/12/11 13:10:28] <jesusalva> 65133.32 brmbrmcars.
[2015/12/11 13:10:29] <brmbrmcar> It may just be impossible to fit it in one week for you.

[2015/12/12 10:57:06] <LeFire> Checkpoints though, I think
[2015/12/12 10:57:13] <Hume2> If you mean the bell, it's the reset point thing.
[2015/12/12 10:57:32] <LeFire> yeah, I was able to get the last reset point
[2015/12/12 10:57:39] <LeFire> I am trying to get the next one though
[2015/12/12 10:57:50] <Hume2> So put another one.
[2015/12/12 10:58:34] <Hume2> What's the problem?
[2015/12/12 10:58:53] <LeFire> I mean, I'm trying to get the next available one :b

[2015/12/12 11:02:11] <LeFire> I want to get the coordinates of the next checkpoint I haven't reached
[2015/12/12 11:02:33] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/12 11:02:48] <Hume2> LeFire: So click on it and the coordinates should reveal.

[2015/12/12 11:04:37] <Hume2> LeFire: On code it's super easy. You just find where the checkpoint has saved.
[2015/12/12 11:04:52] <Hume2> Don't be confused, it saves as "firefly".
[2015/12/12 11:05:39] <brmbrmcar> I don'tlike the way that badguys are in a jumping blindspot.
[2015/12/12 11:06:00] <LeFire> Oh, so it's the firefly x)

[2015/12/12 16:16:26] <Tobbi> As of 3 commits ago, I surpassed christoph sommer in commit count.
[2015/12/12 16:16:28] <Tobbi> I am now 3rd.
[2015/12/12 16:16:36] <Tobbi> Who wants to celebrate? :P
[2015/12/12 16:16:43] <Karkus> Yay!
[2015/12/12 16:16:52] <Tobbi> Karkus: Ah, the design of them? Do we have a designer?
[2015/12/12 16:16:58] <Tobbi> I don't actually think so.
[2015/12/12 16:17:16] <Karkus> paroneayea is still on IRC...
[2015/12/12 16:17:52] <Tobbi> Oh, indeed.
[2015/12/12 16:18:05] <brmbrmcar> I want to be 1st on commit count one day...
[2015/12/12 16:18:08] <brmbrmcar> Overall.
[2015/12/12 16:18:46] <brmbrmcar> I don't want to celebrate.
[2015/12/12 16:18:54] <Karkus> If that happens, something has taken a turn for the worst
[2015/12/12 16:19:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: If what happens?
[2015/12/12 16:19:51] <Karkus> brmbrmcar is first on commit count
[2015/12/12 16:22:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: brmbrmtux...
[2015/12/12 16:22:46] <Tobbi> Karkus:  brmbrmcar is first on annoy count.
[2015/12/12 16:23:00] <brmbrmcar> Who's second?

[2015/12/12 16:25:25] <brmbrmcar> You'll see what I mean.
[2015/12/12 16:25:30] <Karkus> Wasn't obvious to me.
[2015/12/12 16:25:30] <Tobbi> Karkus: Any idea what he's talking about for that issue?
[2015/12/12 16:25:34] <Karkus> Nope.

[2015/12/12 16:57:29] <Not-e81f> [02supertux] 03Success. AppVeyor build succeeded - 13https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maths22/supertux-9ml4d/build/111
[2015/12/12 16:57:46] <joserebelo> The builds on travis are failing because of something on an openssl command
[2015/12/12 16:57:51] <joserebelo> any idea why ?
[2015/12/12 16:58:34] <pedromlcosta> Yeah, we made a pull request with a console script, but it failed.
[2015/12/12 17:02:25] <brmbrmcar> What script?
[2015/12/12 17:02:36] <pedromlcosta> A warp
[2015/12/12 17:02:52] <brmbrmcar> OK, I am confused.
[2015/12/12 17:03:02] <pedromlcosta> the script is called warp, moves Tux X and Y blocks away from where he is
[2015/12/12 17:03:14] <pedromlcosta> and can be called on the console using warp(x, y)
[2015/12/12 17:03:20] <brmbrmcar> functions(...) didn't work.
[2015/12/12 17:03:38] <joserebelo> i read your message, but Tobbi had merged it already
[2015/12/12 17:03:39] <brmbrmcar> How do you use warp(x,y)?
[2015/12/12 17:03:44] <joserebelo> it works here
[2015/12/12 17:03:44] <Tobbi> Hello.
[2015/12/12 17:03:49] <Tobbi> What have I done?
[2015/12/12 17:04:13] <joserebelo> nothing
[2015/12/12 17:04:36] <joserebelo> but the thing is, the travis builds are failing, it has nothing to do with the code changes
[2015/12/12 17:05:50] <brmbrmcar> I'll check out console.nut,
[2015/12/12 17:06:54] <brmbrmcar> So, it is nothing to do with the actual Consl.
[2015/12/12 17:07:06] <joserebelo> ?
[2015/12/12 17:08:13] <brmbrmcar> I mean,it is simpleadd to functions.
[2015/12/12 17:08:32] <pedromlcosta> yeah, we added a function there
[2015/12/12 17:08:35] <pedromlcosta> it works here
[2015/12/12 17:08:43] <brmbrmcar> So it is not affecting the actual Console scripting itself.
[2015/12/12 17:08:47] <pedromlcosta> No
[2015/12/12 17:09:05] <pedromlcosta> We just made the wrapper and added a function in functions.cpp
[2015/12/12 17:09:05] <brmbrmcar> I mean, it is a script, but nothing in the actual console changed.
[2015/12/12 17:09:10] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/12/12 17:09:19] <brmbrmcar> So Console is not involved.
[2015/12/12 17:10:13] <pedromlcosta> Yeah, it isnt. I just call the warp function there, as I would  any script :b
[2015/12/12 17:10:16] <brmbrmcar> I confused myself there...
[2015/12/12 17:10:46] <brmbrmcar> I doubt it'll be merged before 0.4.0.
[2015/12/12 17:11:37] <pedromlcosta> Np, we just needed that it passed and was accepted, for a college/university class we're doing :b
[2015/12/12 17:13:20] <brmbrmcar> I wish it was merged though.
[2015/12/12 17:13:46] <joserebelo> but the travis build didn't fail bcuz of us
[2015/12/12 17:14:05] <joserebelo> the problem isn't related to the code
[2015/12/12 17:15:05] <brmbrmcar> If I hadmy way it would be merged.

[2015/12/12 17:15:26] <brmbrmcar> It isn't harming anything else, right?
[2015/12/12 17:15:31] <joserebelo> but do you know why did it fail?
[2015/12/12 17:15:32] <joserebelo> the travis log says

[2015/12/13 12:07:15] <Hume2_> IRC is buggy today, isn't it?
[2015/12/13 12:07:34] <brmbrmcar> Is it?
[2015/12/13 12:07:48] <brmbrmcar> The logs went
[2015/12/13 12:08:57] <Hume2_> The connection seems to be too weak.
[2015/12/13 12:09:17] <brmbrmcar> ny netsplit?
[2015/12/13 12:09:31] <brmbrmcar> My typing is buggy today.
[2015/12/13 12:10:16] @ Quit: datahead8888: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2015/12/13 12:10:19] <mt> in fact, today only 1 server did have a slightly unstable connection which caused some disconnects between 00:00 and 05:00 UTC+1
[2015/12/13 12:10:46] <mt> one other server had a short lagspike at around 11:30 and 11:42 UTC+1
[2015/12/13 12:11:00] <brmbrmcar> You check every server?
[2015/12/13 12:11:37] <mt> I'm admin of a channel where there's a monitoring bot :)
[2015/12/13 12:11:45] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2015/12/13 12:11:54] <brmbrmcar> What is the mode for admin?
[2015/12/13 12:12:23] <mt> it's got connections to all freenode servers one can connect to from a public IP
[2015/12/13 12:12:53] <mt> admin = well, currently I'm opped (channel mode +o) but I'm also ChanServ +F (founder)
[2015/12/13 12:13:19] <brmbrmcar>  /mode +F
[2015/12/13 12:13:37] <mt> nah, ChanServ +F is a flag (/msg ChanServ help flags)
[2015/12/13 12:14:23] <mt> channel mode +o is a channel mode/status (/quote HELP CMODE)
[2015/12/13 12:15:38] <brmbrmcar> What sort of channel monitors stuff?
[2015/12/13 12:15:59] <mt> fun fact, all bots connected to a server spam a specific channel with 1 msg/s per bot with unix timestamps to check inter-server lag :>

[2015/12/14 10:58:39] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Why would this cause issues?
[2015/12/14 10:59:54] * head8debian is tired...
[2015/12/14 11:00:10] * head8debian is sore...
[2015/12/14 11:01:25] <brmbrmcar> If new stuff was added, and the flowers are clearly handled very differently.
[2015/12/14 11:02:02] <brmbrmcar> I think it is a bug in the fireflowers itself, and patching up other areas could lead to hiding it.
[2015/12/14 11:02:22] <Tobbi> head8debian doesn't want to do this anymore.
[2015/12/14 11:02:39] <Tobbi> head8debian is fired.

[2015/12/14 11:05:33] <Tobbi> Great.
[2015/12/14 11:06:02] <Tobbi> grumbel: And bug-wise? Should be fine, right? I haven't noticed any blockers...
[2015/12/14 11:06:17] <grumbel> no idea, I haven't touched the game in ages
[2015/12/14 11:08:35] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2015/12/14 11:08:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did you notice any blockers while playing the game?
[2015/12/14 11:11:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: I havent. I havent played the game much lately either.
[2015/12/14 11:11:51] <Tobbi> head8debian: You should.
[2015/12/14 11:12:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: We have a release in 6 days.
[2015/12/14 11:12:20] <brmbrmcar> What do you mean by "blockers" anyway?
[2015/12/14 11:15:33] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Big very important bugs that *need* to be fixed.

[2015/12/14 12:29:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Id like to remember the name of the program a friend recomended to me that would allow you to make any application portable...
[2015/12/14 12:29:53] <head8debian> I cannot remember the name though...
[2015/12/14 12:29:59] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't know either.
[2015/12/14 12:33:17] <mt> Isn't there something like GNOME's "starters"
[2015/12/14 12:33:21] <mt> for Windows
[2015/12/14 12:33:32] <head8debian> mt: Huh>
[2015/12/14 12:33:33] <head8debian> ?
[2015/12/14 12:33:41] <Karkus> Hume2 & Tobbi: I think a portable version would be very useful. It's a pain having to install all the time.
[2015/12/14 12:34:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe what we need to do is ask portableapps.com to update theirs...
[2015/12/14 12:34:12] <brmbrmcar> Which is why I wanted a Linux tar.gz file.
[2015/12/14 12:34:19] <Hume2> SuperTux doesn't need any install on Windows anyway. You can just copy 'n' paste.
[2015/12/14 12:34:30] <mt> head8debian: files that look like an app/program but call another command (possibly with arguments) when you open them
[2015/12/14 12:34:32] <Karkus> Hume2: Huh?
[2015/12/14 12:34:51] <mt> because, I don't really like the idea of promoting any apps that could inject bullshit into SuperTux
[2015/12/14 12:34:56] <Hume2> Karkus: You just copy 'n' paste the compiled SuperTux.
[2015/12/14 12:35:18] <Tobbi> Hume2: That doesn't change the fact that it writes the config to %USERPROFILE%
[2015/12/14 12:35:18] <Karkus> You still have the datadir problem...
[2015/12/14 12:35:21] <Tobbi> which it shouldn't.
[2015/12/14 12:35:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: We can have an option for this.
[2015/12/14 12:35:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: we do.
[2015/12/14 12:35:54] <Tobbi> Karkus: But we need a wrapper that calls supertux with those arguments.
[2015/12/14 12:36:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: I know, but not from within supertux.

[2015/12/14 12:40:59] <head8debian> And shut their mouths.
[2015/12/14 12:41:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: No.
[2015/12/14 12:41:06] <Tobbi> No, thanks.
[2015/12/14 12:41:09] <head8debian> Probably a kiddy script.

[2015/12/14 12:44:33] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/12/14 12:44:38] <head8debian> ok,ok.
[2015/12/14 12:45:35] <mt> yandex is a russian provider
[2015/12/14 12:45:51] <mt> why is it typical for germans to use yandex
[2015/12/14 12:45:54] <head8debian> mt: I couldnt remember if it was russian or german...
[2015/12/14 12:46:08] <head8debian> *facepalm*
[2015/12/14 12:46:28] <mt> the majority of german email providers uses *.de

[2015/12/14 12:47:39] <mt> that's useless

[2015/12/14 12:49:45] <Karkus> SuperTux's physics is wrong. Or at least, part of it is. If you jump on a moving platform you get left behind, and fall off the back.
[2015/12/14 12:56:22] <brmbrmcar> It doesn't show inertia.
[2015/12/14 12:57:22] <Karkus> It doesn't account for it, no/
[2015/12/14 12:58:33] <brmbrmcar> Bad.
[2015/12/14 12:58:45] <brmbrmcar> Butthe second you jump, hell!
[2015/12/14 12:59:09] <brmbrmcar> You'd have a bit of forward movement at keast.
[2015/12/14 13:00:10] <brmbrmcar> Improvements!
[2015/12/14 13:00:18] <Tobbi> mt: Do you know a spamcop reporting plugin for thunderbird?
[2015/12/14 13:00:49] <mt> nope
[2015/12/14 13:00:54] <mt> but you can forward iirc
[2015/12/14 13:00:55] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/12/14 13:01:06] <Tobbi> A plugin would've made things so much easier.

[2015/12/14 14:23:25] <Hume2> Karkus: It's the "Ghosttree test". I think that it deserves to be a name of the forest boss level.
[2015/12/14 14:25:31] <Tobbi> OpenGL is quite annoying...
[2015/12/14 14:25:38] <Karkus> Hume2: I don't know then. "suck" isn't bad, maybe come up with another name.
[2015/12/14 14:26:38] <Hume2> Tobbi: Agreed. All that GLsomethingSTUFF.
[2015/12/14 14:26:53] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yeah, it's so hard to debug.
[2015/12/14 14:27:23] <Hume2> Karkus: I think that it could be called somehow "Trees Swallow" or so.
[2015/12/14 14:28:06] <Tobbi> That would be even worse.
[2015/12/14 14:28:17] <Tobbi> Swallowing is also an innuendo.

[2015/12/15 10:42:11] <brmbrmcar> Oh, just been answered.
[2015/12/15 10:42:14] <maths22> (I do hope to have OBS going for git builds sometime after 0.4.0 comes out)
[2015/12/15 10:42:53] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/12/15 10:43:08] <Tobbi> I just hope that people won't find it too difficult to install language packs.
[2015/12/15 10:43:18] <Tobbi> I *hope* that this won't be overlooked.
[2015/12/15 10:43:48] <Tobbi> People might assume that since the game is already translated, they don't need to install language packs.
[2015/12/15 10:44:09] <jesusalva> Exactly.
[2015/12/15 10:44:10] <maths22> Tobbi: We need to add clearer documentation that language packs are for translating addons
[2015/12/15 10:44:20] <maths22> I don't think that that is currently obvious
[2015/12/15 10:44:21] <Tobbi> maths22: Yeah, but where?
[2015/12/15 10:44:29] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Distros will compile supertux for their repos once 4.0 is released.
[2015/12/15 10:44:36] <maths22> Tobbi: I have no idea
[2015/12/15 10:44:41] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/12/15 10:44:45] <maths22> I was hoping someone else had a good idea
[2015/12/15 10:45:02] <Tobbi> maths22: I mean: We could package po files with each individual add-on.
[2015/12/15 10:45:05] <Tobbi> That woud work.
[2015/12/15 10:45:53] <Tobbi> I believe it's even supported by the game.
[2015/12/15 10:47:24] <brmbrmcar> Do you think there should be target times on more levels?
[2015/12/15 10:49:12] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Not for now. We can revisit the idea once the release is done.

[2015/12/15 10:49:21] <grumbel> Tobbi: language packs should be downloaded automatically when the language is selected
[2015/12/15 10:49:27] <maths22_> grumbel: I like that idea

[2015/12/15 10:49:45] <maths22_> The server has decided to temporarily go down, so that is kind of annyooing
[2015/12/15 10:49:46] <Tobbi> grumbel: Problem is, people who have SuperTux already installed...well, you get the idea.
[2015/12/15 10:50:10] <Tobbi> The langpacks never update.
[2015/12/15 10:50:21] <maths22_> Should I change the readme to have the new URL?
[2015/12/15 10:50:35] <grumbel> Currently there are two language settings, one in the AddOn menu and one in the Options
[2015/12/15 10:50:40] @ Quit: maths22_: Client Quit
[2015/12/15 10:50:45] <grumbel> You shouldn't have to select the language twice
[2015/12/15 10:50:50] <brmbrmcar> I don't think they should automatically be downloaded.
[2015/12/15 10:50:56] @ maths22_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/15 10:51:07] <brmbrmcar> It should be a option when selecting the language.
[2015/12/15 10:51:15] <Tobbi> grumbel: Alright...
[2015/12/15 10:51:24] <Tobbi> Yeah, it seems fine then.
[2015/12/15 10:51:40] <Tobbi> maths22_: The tarball built fine on OS X.
[2015/12/15 10:51:55] <maths22_> Tobbi: Great!
[2015/12/15 10:52:25] <maths22_> Of course, no one can download it right now, but that should be fixed soon (I'm finding out what happened now)
[2015/12/15 10:52:32] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/12/15 10:52:50] <Tobbi> SuperTux is quite slow to start for me.
[2015/12/15 10:52:52] <Tobbi> For some reason.
[2015/12/15 10:54:02] <brmbrmcar> Why can't I download it?
[2015/12/15 10:54:14] <brmbrmcar> I don't have enough space.
[2015/12/15 10:54:18] <maths22_> brmbrmcar: Because the server is down right now.  Sorry.  I'm looking into it
[2015/12/15 10:54:37] <Tobbi> I wanted to write a cynical answer...
[2015/12/15 10:54:45] <Tobbi> maybe it's good I didn't.
[2015/12/15 10:55:10] <brmbrmcar> Ah.OK.
[2015/12/15 10:57:13] <Tobbi> wow, we got 23 followers on twitter.
[2015/12/15 10:57:45] <Tobbi> Quite good.
[2015/12/15 10:59:19] <brmbrmcar> Who cares about followers on Twitter. I care about the number of stars!
[2015/12/15 10:59:41] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I am a star. That's all that's needed.
[2015/12/15 10:59:56] <brmbrmcar> Which star?

[2015/12/15 11:02:32] <Tobbi> whiskey is not that good.
[2015/12/15 11:02:40] <leyyin> whisky is the best
[2015/12/15 11:02:48] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: SPELLING!

[2015/12/15 11:06:35] <maths22_> Apparently the server issue is actually an ISP issue.

[2015/12/15 11:07:46] <leyyin> do they want independence?
[2015/12/15 11:07:57] <Tobbi> leyyin: They are independent. We deny their existence.

[2015/12/15 11:18:04] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2015/12/15 11:18:17] <Tobbi> You told me this, before, didn't you? :D I suck at remembering things.
[2015/12/15 11:18:36] <maths22> The person who runs the server told me he's planning to switch ISPs soon (These sorts of things have happened too often)
[2015/12/15 11:18:42] <maths22> Tobbi: and yes, I did already say this
[2015/12/15 11:18:55] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/12/15 13:02:51] <brmbrmcar> Way,way better than pastebin.com!
[2015/12/15 13:05:24] <Karkus> The problem with your level is that it's not particularly fun. You've got lots of features, but it's just plain difficult
[2015/12/15 13:05:54] <brmbrmcar> I thought it was much easier than  a lot of levels in IncubaterIsland.
[2015/12/15 13:06:04] <brmbrmcar> But where could it be made esier?
[2015/12/15 13:40:27] <maths22> leyyin: I have to agree about the topic
[2015/12/15 13:42:10] <leyyin> thanks maths22, I just got electrocuted at my usb 3 port because of you ;)

[2015/12/15 15:43:34] <maths22> Tobbi: Can we plan to code-freeze on Thursday or Friday and tag then-that way any minor issues can be ironed out?
[2015/12/15 15:44:15] <maths22> We wouldn't publish any offical releases until Sunday, but that way if any of the builds have issues or something else doesn't work, we have a chance to fix it
[2015/12/15 15:44:25] <Tobbi> maths22: You want to iron out issues after the code freeze? Won't people assume they have to build off the tagged SHA1?
[2015/12/15 15:44:32] <Tobbi> *off of
[2015/12/15 15:45:30] <maths22> Tobbi: let me re-state that: code freeze, check builds, then tag and check those builds
[2015/12/15 15:45:43] <Tobbi> maths22: Okay, that sounds fine with me.
[2015/12/15 15:45:53] <Tobbi> Right. Builds...
[2015/12/15 15:45:54] <Tobbi> Not code :D
[2015/12/15 15:45:59] <maths22> The second set should only be issues in the build system, and won't require any new code
[2015/12/15 15:46:32] <Tobbi> maths22: So, that means pulling from transifex on thursday, right?
[2015/12/15 15:46:46] <Tobbi> or rather friday...

[2015/12/15 16:05:03] <brmbrmcar> hi
[2015/12/15 16:08:30] <Tobbi> hello, Poino
[2015/12/15 16:08:51] <Poino> can i ask sth?
[2015/12/15 16:09:02] <Tobbi> Poino: sure.
[2015/12/15 16:09:23] <Poino> will there be an editor for the next release (stable) of SuperTux?
[2015/12/15 16:09:41] <Tobbi> Poino: Editor is still in the making. Karkus and I are working on something based on Python.
[2015/12/15 16:09:50] <Tobbi> Poino: Unfortunately we couldn't make it for 0.4.0
[2015/12/15 16:10:04] <brmbrmcar> here will be an integrated one in  0.4.1 hopefully.
[2015/12/15 16:10:12] <Poino> :D
[2015/12/15 16:10:16] <Tobbi> Yes, with less features than the python one obviously.
[2015/12/15 16:10:21] <Poino> At least you're making it
[2015/12/15 16:10:28] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/12/15 16:10:33] <Tobbi> Poino: Ever used the old one?
[2015/12/15 16:10:43] <Poino> The one from milestone 1
[2015/12/15 16:10:45] <Poino> Â¿?
[2015/12/15 16:10:52] <brmbrmcar> No, the mono one.
[2015/12/15 16:10:53] <Tobbi> Poino: There's a C# editor as well.
[2015/12/15 16:10:56] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/12/15 16:11:11] <brmbrmcar> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux-editor
[2015/12/15 16:11:29] <Poino> thx
[2015/12/15 16:11:38] <brmbrmcar> I prefer that one.
[2015/12/15 16:11:39] <Tobbi> Poino: It's quite tedious to setup...
[2015/12/15 16:11:52] <Poino> i realise
[2015/12/15 16:11:52] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Because the new one doesn't have all the features...
[2015/12/15 16:11:54] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/15 16:12:02] <Tobbi> (yet)
[2015/12/15 16:12:15] <brmbrmcar> PersonallyI wish it was still in development, but it was extremelybuggy on some systems.
[2015/12/15 16:12:30] <brmbrmcar> Soon Flexlay will bemuch better.
[2015/12/15 16:12:34] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: It needs mono + gtk\
[2015/12/15 16:12:36] <Tobbi> #
[2015/12/15 16:12:41] <Poino> And what will the new editor will have?
[2015/12/15 16:12:42] <Tobbi> plus some magic.
[2015/12/15 16:12:56] <Tobbi> Poino: at some point it will have all the features of the old one.
[2015/12/15 16:13:00] <Tobbi> Based on python and everything.
[2015/12/15 16:13:22] <Poino> Interesting
[2015/12/15 16:13:22] <brmbrmcar> There's a really good ppa for the C~ one.
[2015/12/15 16:13:30] <brmbrmcar> For Ubuntu.
[2015/12/15 16:13:36] <Tobbi> Poino: If you know Python, you can help ;)
[2015/12/15 16:13:45] <brmbrmcar> Which is how I got that editor.

[2015/12/15 16:14:56] <brmbrmcar> I mean, I could learn it quickly, when seeing it.

[2015/12/17 11:35:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D

[2015/12/17 11:38:22] <Tobbi> head8debian: I read that article...It is true, firefox might be a walking dead. I still use it, though.
[2015/12/17 11:38:25] <Tobbi> But the spirit is gone.
[2015/12/17 11:38:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: I still use it also.
[2015/12/17 11:38:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its sad though.
[2015/12/17 11:39:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: People will continue to develop Firefox...
[2015/12/17 11:39:10] <head8debian> mt: So you want me to filter to all of those names and add them all?
[2015/12/17 11:39:27] <head8debian> Tobbi: I know. :) Thats why its open source.
[2015/12/17 11:39:40] <head8debian> If it were not, youd have a really big issue.
[2015/12/17 11:39:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: I would?
[2015/12/17 11:39:52] <Tobbi> Personally?
[2015/12/17 11:40:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: Hmm?
[2015/12/17 11:40:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not im confused.
[2015/12/17 11:40:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why would I have a really big issue if Firefox is dead? I|d use Chromium.
[2015/12/17 11:41:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: I am not ready to use one of these smaller FOSS browsers with less support, but i think id rather do that then switch to chromium fully.
[2015/12/17 11:42:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: On the other hand: Maybe handing Firefox or Thunderbird to the community might give it some momentum.

[2015/12/17 11:42:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: True.
[2015/12/17 11:43:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: Midori just doesn't cut it.
[2015/12/17 11:43:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: You know: Thunderbird was not a priority...I talked to Mitchell Baker personally and told her that webbased e-mail is not the future, but that a lot of people still use thunderbird.
[2015/12/17 11:43:33] <Tobbi> Especially here in Germany.
[2015/12/17 11:43:43] <Tobbi> iirc, it's the most common e-mail client in Germany.
[2015/12/17 11:44:13] <head8debian> Tobbi: I personally love it.
[2015/12/17 11:44:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: me, too.
[2015/12/17 11:46:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: You know: It worked for LibreOffice, it might work for thunderbird, too...getting independent I mean.
[2015/12/17 11:46:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: I love firefox as well... but it is quit slow.
[2015/12/17 11:46:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: Libre office is awesome. :)
[2015/12/17 11:46:27] <Tobbi> Yup, it is for me as well, somewhat.
[2015/12/17 11:46:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: Maybe someone will fork firefox if they dont hand it over.
[2015/12/17 11:46:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: I agree...and openoffice is stumbling along...
[2015/12/17 11:46:49] <Tobbi> head8debian: They could, they just need to name it something else...
[2015/12/17 11:46:54] <Tobbi> Also, the codebase is huge.
[2015/12/17 11:46:57] <Tobbi> They need a lot of peopel.
[2015/12/17 11:46:57] <head8debian> And it will become like Libre Office.
[2015/12/17 11:47:01] <Tobbi> *people
[2015/12/17 11:47:02] * head8debian nods...
[2015/12/17 11:47:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: Open office is not doing the greatest i hear...
[2015/12/17 11:47:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's still part of the Apache Foundation, isn't it?
[2015/12/17 11:48:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes, IIRC.
[2015/12/17 11:48:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ive never used it, so i cannot say im helping much. :)
[2015/12/17 11:49:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: I used it in the beginning, before it was forked...
[2015/12/17 11:49:14] <Tobbi> And I have to admit, LibreOffice is much greater...
[2015/12/17 11:49:49] <head8debian> Tobbi: I think Libre Office is quite nice, so ive never tried Open Office.
[2015/12/17 11:50:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: I do have to admit that firefox is quite slow...
[2015/12/17 11:51:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: Even without extensions?
[2015/12/17 11:51:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not at laoding pages, but it just doesn't seem to handle resources well.
[2015/12/17 11:51:19] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/12/17 11:51:40] <head8debian> Ive noticed this on every machine ive installed it on thus far.
[2015/12/17 11:52:07] <head8debian> Say a really dense javascript website, firefox will stutter through it, where chrome acts like its nothing
[2015/12/17 11:53:59] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/12/17 11:59:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: What you can do is go through all the methods and tell me which of them need a const
[2015/12/17 12:04:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: What?
[2015/12/17 12:04:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: You know: Const correctness.
[2015/12/17 12:04:54] <Tobbi> SuperTux has to be 100% const correct before the release.
[2015/12/17 12:05:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: Heh.
[2015/12/17 12:12:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: Should we switch to SHA-1 after the release for add-ons?
[2015/12/17 12:15:56] <mt> >SHA-1
[2015/12/17 12:16:03] <mt> guys it's almost 2016
[2015/12/17 12:16:40] <mt> SHA-2-256 is the minimum, SHA-2-512 is nice, SHA-3-512/BLAKE2 is even better
[2015/12/17 12:16:55] <Tobbi> mt: I am not knowledgeable about hashing algorithms...

[2015/12/17 12:17:25] <mt> are we using some library for hashing at the moment?
[2015/12/17 12:17:35] <mt> or is that part built-in?
[2015/12/17 12:18:10] <Tobbi> mt: It's built in, we have md5.cpp.
[2015/12/17 12:18:20] <Tobbi>  /.hpp
[2015/12/17 12:19:03] <mt> could we consider switching to a library?

[2015/12/17 12:20:37] <Tobbi> mt: We certainly could. Create an issue. We'll deal with it after the release.

[2015/12/17 13:03:52] <Tobbi> And quite a big code change.

[2015/12/17 13:07:08] <Tobbi> Do we have anything that inherits OpenALSoundSource? Why are the methods marked virtual?
[2015/12/17 13:09:37] <Tobbi> Oh, yeah, StreamSoundSource inherits OpenALSoundSource.
[2015/12/17 13:10:51] <Tobbi> Although it really doesn't override any of the methods.
[2015/12/17 13:10:57] <Tobbi> But we might still want that virtual there.

[2015/12/17 13:40:49] <Tobbi> I wonder why we are passing some of that stuff by value instead of by ref....
[2015/12/17 13:42:25] <Karkus> Pointers and references... *sigh*
[2015/12/17 13:43:28] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yup...I am trying to switch some of the things in worldmap.cpp from pointer to ref...

[2015/12/17 13:46:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: It shouldn't do that.
[2015/12/17 13:46:27] <Tobbi> Only if you ran make clean
[2015/12/17 13:46:36] <Tobbi> Or something else that deletes the previously compiled files.
[2015/12/17 13:46:42] <Tobbi> or alters them.
[2015/12/17 13:47:03] <Karkus> git reset --hard HEAD probably does that.
[2015/12/17 13:47:07] <Karkus> That's why.
[2015/12/17 13:47:42] <Karkus> I should probably run it only on the datadir. My testing with Flexlay always changes a few levels
[2015/12/17 13:48:07] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/12/17 13:50:38] <Tobbi> I
[2015/12/17 13:50:43] <Tobbi> 'll test my modifications...
[2015/12/17 13:50:48] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2015/12/17 13:50:56] <Tobbi> Sometimes I don't understand what the people thought.
[2015/12/17 13:50:59] <Tobbi> I wish grumbel was here.
[2015/12/17 13:52:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: Surely if it works as const it should be const?
[2015/12/17 13:52:32] <Karkus> But I suck at C++ :P
[2015/12/17 13:52:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: Possibly... I am merely talking about pointers vs. refs.
[2015/12/17 13:53:04] <Tobbi> I don't want to change a value that didn't need to be changed.
[2015/12/17 13:53:11] <Karkus> Oh, yeah.
[2015/12/17 13:54:05] <Hume2> I put some stuff to the thread for ideas.
[2015/12/17 13:54:29] <Tobbi> SuperTux is so slow to start...
[2015/12/17 13:55:09] <Hume2> What happened?
[2015/12/17 13:55:25] <Tobbi> I don't know.
[2015/12/17 13:55:30] <Tobbi> If I knew, I could figure it out.
[2015/12/17 13:55:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Slower than usual?
[2015/12/17 13:56:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, it's actually been slow for days...
[2015/12/17 13:57:01] <Karkus> hmmm... that's not good
[2015/12/17 13:57:37] <Tobbi>  I'm actually compiling stuff on the side.
[2015/12/17 13:57:41] <Tobbi> So maybe that's the cause.
[2015/12/17 13:58:32] <Karkus> Maybe, I don't think I've noticed anything

[2015/12/17 14:08:12] <Tobbi> Karkus: What I meant was that the readme talks about abandoning the forest world...
[2015/12/17 14:08:16] <Tobbi> This needs to be changed.
[2015/12/17 14:08:19] <Tobbi> Since we won't abandon it.
[2015/12/17 14:08:36] <Karkus> Okay, I'll update the readme

[2015/12/17 14:31:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: sounds good.
[2015/12/17 14:32:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: I will probably migrate makepot.sh over to python.
[2015/12/17 14:32:55] <Tobbi> Or have a different version of it.
[2015/12/17 14:33:18] <Tobbi> Because shell is quite...annoying.

[2015/12/17 14:37:32] <Tobbi> ok.

[2015/12/17 14:41:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: Now I know why I got confused about print "something" vs. print("something")...because it's new.
[2015/12/17 14:41:32] <Tobbi> And I thought I'd remembered wrong.
[2015/12/17 14:42:13] <Karkus> It mixed me up too. print("Hello World!") is 10 million times better in my opinion, though.
[2015/12/17 14:42:32] <Tobbi> I don't have a preference for either...
[2015/12/17 14:42:39] <Karkus> It works in Python 2 until you try multiple arguments
[2015/12/17 14:43:06] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/17 14:43:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: I just think that the connection should be made between print() and calling a function.
[2015/12/17 14:43:27] <Tobbi> Ah, yes.
[2015/12/17 14:43:30] <Tobbi> That's true.
[2015/12/17 14:43:51] <swift110> hey all
[2015/12/17 14:43:55] <Karkus> print "Hello" feels like a new construct altogether
[2015/12/17 14:43:58] <Tobbi> hey swift110
[2015/12/17 14:44:09] <Karkus> Hello, swift110
[2015/12/17 14:44:43] <swift110> hey Tobbi and Karkus how are you guys
[2015/12/17 14:44:54] <Tobbi> swift110: Quite fine. Getting ready for the release...
[2015/12/17 14:44:56] <Tobbi> Somewhat.
[2015/12/17 14:45:15] <swift110> Tobbi: new version of the game?
[2015/12/17 14:45:25] <Karkus> swift110: Yup
[2015/12/17 14:45:41] <Tobbi> swift110: Release is on Sunday...
[2015/12/17 14:45:49] <Tobbi> Milestone 2 stable release.
[2015/12/17 14:45:58] <Karkus> swift110: I'm feeling somewhat daunted by the length of our todo list, most of which I can't help with :/

[2015/12/17 14:48:39] <swift110> whats new with this version?
[2015/12/17 14:49:03] <Tobbi> swift110: Compared to what version?

[2015/12/17 15:12:38] <giby> Hi
[2015/12/17 15:14:55] <Tobbi> Hey giby.
[2015/12/17 15:15:11] <giby> Tobbi, when is the release?
[2015/12/17 15:15:16] <Tobbi> giby: On Sunday.
[2015/12/17 15:15:37] <giby> Ok, I should update text then ;)
[2015/12/17 15:15:43] <swift110> thats cool
[2015/12/17 15:15:43] <Tobbi> giby: I've been wanting to ask you something: Which languages do we include in the game? Aka, from which percentage?
[2015/12/17 15:16:00] <Tobbi> giby: Can you do it on Saturday? I'd rather give the localizers these 2 extra dazs.
[2015/12/17 15:16:02] <Tobbi> days
[2015/12/17 15:16:10] <giby> yes
[2015/12/17 15:16:16] <Tobbi> If you don't have time on saturday, you can do it now.
[2015/12/17 15:16:24] <Tobbi> Suit yourself.
[2015/12/17 15:19:19] <giby> So, include when main menu is over 50%
[2015/12/17 15:19:59] <Tobbi> giby: Okay...is that the rule you've been following?
[2015/12/17 15:21:38] <giby> For dev version, everything was added to make it easier to manage ....
[2015/12/17 15:22:14] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/12/17 15:22:22] <Tobbi> Yeah, but no.
[2015/12/17 15:22:29] <Tobbi> 50% sounds good.
[2015/12/17 15:23:32] <Tobbi> giby: Actually, main menu is the most important one. Can't we say "All locales which have main menu and world 1 translated will be included"?
[2015/12/17 15:23:45] <Tobbi> The other worlds are not that important.
[2015/12/17 15:24:18] <giby> main menu is important enough ;)
[2015/12/17 15:24:29] <Karkus> Main menu + options etc. ?
[2015/12/17 15:25:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, yes... That is all in one file.
[2015/12/17 15:25:53] <Karkus> Ah, okay.
[2015/12/17 15:26:31] <Tobbi> giby: Actually, you can update the translation files...and please make language add-ons out of the other things.
[2015/12/17 15:26:38] <Tobbi> You know, that one script...
[2015/12/17 15:29:58] <giby> update to Tx or from Tx?
[2015/12/17 15:32:05] <Tobbi> giby: from tx...
[2015/12/17 15:37:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: Any idea why I suddenly get this error: http://pastebin.com/PQzWbEDD ?
[2015/12/17 15:38:44] <Karkus> That's odd...
[2015/12/17 15:39:39] <Tobbi> It definitely is.
[2015/12/17 15:40:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: I get that error too, when running from ./supertux-editor. Not from PyCharm though
[2015/12/17 15:40:29] <Tobbi> Interesting. Did that change recently?
[2015/12/17 15:40:40] <Karkus> Nope
[2015/12/17 15:40:52] <Tobbi> I can remember being able to run it like ./supertux-editor
[2015/12/17 15:41:01] <Karkus> I haven't been updating the __init__ files. I probably should
[2015/12/17 15:41:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes, I could too.
[2015/12/17 15:41:10] <Karkus> Wait a minute
[2015/12/17 15:42:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Something has gone horribly wrong.
[2015/12/17 15:42:43] <Karkus> It's fixable though
[2015/12/17 15:42:46] <Karkus> but concerning
[2015/12/17 15:42:47] <Tobbi> uh? How comes?
[2015/12/17 15:42:56] <Karkus> change it to .util.config
[2015/12/17 15:43:19] <Karkus> Well 'horribly' was probably an exaggeration
[2015/12/17 15:43:44] <Karkus> Tobbi: Actually, no. I did change this file
[2015/12/17 15:44:00] <Karkus> By refactoring, not manually
[2015/12/17 15:44:11] <Karkus> I moved config.py to util
[2015/12/17 15:44:18] <Tobbi> Ah!
[2015/12/17 15:44:24] <Karkus> So all is well
[2015/12/17 15:44:44] <Karkus> Pycharm didn't refactor right.
[2015/12/17 15:44:56] <Karkus> I will quickly fix this

[2015/12/17 15:52:19] <Tobbi> yeah, works here as well.

[2015/12/17 15:53:30] <Tobbi> I'll try...everything is so slow.

[2015/12/17 16:08:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: ice has been added a long time ago. As for air and earth...uhm, lt me check.
[2015/12/17 16:08:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: A long time ago, yet implemented in almost no levels!
[2015/12/17 16:09:10] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's true...Because most ice island badguys simply don't react to it.
[2015/12/17 16:09:20] <Karkus> Of course
[2015/12/17 16:10:20] <Karkus> I think maybe some of the 'high up' levels in the ice island should feature Air tux, and maybe a cave level with Earth? Or are we saving them for later introduction?
[2015/12/17 16:11:34] <Karkus> Tobbi: Just thinking what screenshots to add here http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Screenshots#Supertux_0.4.0
[2015/12/17 16:12:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, it's fine. We should add some levels...but we don't have enough time, I presume.
[2015/12/17 16:12:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: Not now, of course
[2015/12/17 16:12:30] <Tobbi> Karkus: Any new features we can showcast?
[2015/12/17 16:12:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't know. Very little while I've been around.
[2015/12/17 16:13:10] <Karkus> Hume would probably remember better
[2015/12/17 16:13:10] <Tobbi> Yes, that's true.
[2015/12/17 16:13:17] <Tobbi> We should check git log.
[2015/12/17 16:13:48] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2015/12/17 16:13:51] <Karkus> Okay, I'll have a look. Quite a lot, though
[2015/12/17 16:13:53] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's since 0.3.3
[2015/12/17 16:14:06] <Tobbi> So maybe we should feature some of the new stuff since 0.3.3
[2015/12/17 16:14:09] <Karkus> On the Wiki it is
[2015/12/17 16:14:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Certainly.
[2015/12/17 16:14:33] <Tobbi> Karkus: Maybe gradients, language packs, etc.
[2015/12/17 16:14:36] <Karkus> I don't think it's worth creating a new entry
[2015/12/17 16:15:03] <Tobbi> A screenshot showing a clean coverity build...with thumbs up icons photoshopped into it.

[2015/12/17 16:19:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: Did I? Could be. But it's outdated.
[2015/12/17 16:19:32] <Karkus> By a few days, maybe
[2015/12/17 16:19:59] <Tobbi> I also created an etherpad, iirc.
[2015/12/17 16:20:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: Etherpad?

[2015/12/17 16:21:12] <Karkus> Could this be what we need to check through?
[2015/12/17 16:21:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: I will create a new one.
[2015/12/17 16:21:32] <Tobbi> Or update that one.
[2015/12/17 16:24:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: What was changed about gradients?
[2015/12/17 16:24:51] <Tobbi> Karkus: it's now possible to have gradients spawning the whole sector.
[2015/12/17 16:25:01] <Tobbi> Instead of just the screen.
[2015/12/17 16:25:28] <Karkus> gradients of what?
[2015/12/17 16:25:41] <Karkus> terrain?
[2015/12/17 16:28:33] <Tobbi> Karkus: Background gradients.

[2015/12/17 16:30:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Changelog_0.4.0_%28WIP%29
[2015/12/17 16:32:58] <Tobbi> Right, new bonus blocks...
[2015/12/17 16:36:22] <Karkus> Yup
[2015/12/17 16:36:37] <Karkus> Badguy and script bonus blocks
[2015/12/17 16:37:35] <Karkus> restart level button
[2015/12/17 16:37:53] <Karkus> Hume's new animations freeze and burn
[2015/12/17 16:37:59] <Karkus> no, melt.
[2015/12/17 16:38:00] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/12/17 16:38:08] <Tobbi> General code quality...
[2015/12/17 16:39:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: Jumpy sprite in forest levels (bah!)
[2015/12/17 16:39:26] <Tobbi> hah, indeed.
[2015/12/17 16:39:37] <head8debian> Are we ready?!?! :D
[2015/12/17 16:39:49] <head8debian> Prelimenary tests? :D
[2015/12/17 16:39:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: c'mon...relax...
[2015/12/17 16:39:59] <Tobbi> still 3 days before release.
[2015/12/17 16:40:25] <Karkus> head8debian: Yes, of course. Go ahead.
[2015/12/17 16:40:28] <Karkus> :)
[2015/12/17 16:40:29] <Tobbi> head8debian: Is SuperTux slow to startup for you?
[2015/12/17 16:40:42] <Karkus> Mr Candle
[2015/12/17 16:40:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: Like... uhm, i havent tested since this morning?
[2015/12/17 16:40:58] <Tobbi> Oh, zyes.
[2015/12/17 16:41:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: Doesn't matter.
[2015/12/17 16:41:05] <Tobbi> Is it?
[2015/12/17 16:41:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: It was then, just the first start.
[2015/12/17 16:41:23] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2015/12/17 16:41:27] <Tobbi> Okay, so it's my computer.
[2015/12/17 16:41:30] <Tobbi> Reassuring somewhat.
[2015/12/17 16:41:31] <head8debian> I will retry now.
[2015/12/17 16:41:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats wrong?
[2015/12/17 16:41:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't know.
[2015/12/17 16:41:44] <Karkus> Tobbi: Try running any other games?
[2015/12/17 16:41:50] <Tobbi> I will...
[2015/12/17 16:41:59] <head8debian> ?
[2015/12/17 16:41:59] <Tobbi> I will actually run through a profiler.
[2015/12/17 16:42:11] <head8debian> HDD failing?
[2015/12/17 16:42:22] <head8debian> ram being extra fast?
[2015/12/17 16:42:32] * head8debian is confused...
[2015/12/17 16:42:43] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/17 16:42:48] <Tobbi> Probably HDD...
[2015/12/17 16:43:03] <Karkus> Probably because you're on a Mac
[2015/12/17 16:43:14] <Tobbi> Also, why would "--->  Staging webkit-gtk3 into destroot"  take so long?
[2015/12/17 16:43:33] <head8debian> Macs are suprisingly slow to boot...At least the ones ive used.
[2015/12/17 16:43:53] <Tobbi> Mine is fast at booting.
[2015/12/17 16:44:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: What about nightly builds and new web address
[2015/12/17 16:44:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, probably a side note :P
[2015/12/17 16:45:07] <Tobbi> Well, new web address, sure.
[2015/12/17 16:45:17] <Tobbi> But nightly builds are for early-adopters.
[2015/12/17 16:45:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, took 40 secs to start after building with the last git pull.
[2015/12/17 16:45:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: Uhm...
[2015/12/17 16:46:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: When was the last time you tested?
[2015/12/17 16:46:03] <head8debian> Tobbi: It does seem to be loading stuff since my HDD is making noises. No HDD light sadly.
[2015/12/17 16:46:18] <head8debian> Tobbi: That seems *extremely* long though.
[2015/12/17 16:46:27] <Tobbi> Yes. I don't know why...
[2015/12/17 16:46:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: After it is loaded the first time it takes about 3 secs.
[2015/12/17 16:47:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: Oh, i had a system upgrade going at the same time.
[2015/12/17 16:47:55] <leyyin> blimey
[2015/12/17 16:48:01] <Karkus> Yeah, I get the same thing...
[2015/12/17 16:48:02] <head8debian> No wonder my HDD was being used.
[2015/12/17 16:48:16] <head8debian> But it still takes about that long to do it.
[2015/12/17 16:48:22] <head8debian> leyyin: What?
[2015/12/17 16:48:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Can you check with GDB or something?
[2015/12/17 16:48:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats GDB?
[2015/12/17 16:49:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: a debugger...
[2015/12/17 16:49:07] <leyyin> the gnu debugger
[2015/12/17 16:49:07] <head8debian> Debugging of some sort IIRC.
[2015/12/17 16:49:12] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/12/17 16:49:21] <head8debian> Let me guess, i first have to install it? :D
[2015/12/17 16:49:27] <leyyin> if you have gcc
[2015/12/17 16:49:31] <leyyin> you have gdb
[2015/12/17 16:50:05] <Tobbi> I'm running it through instruments...
[2015/12/17 16:50:05] <head8debian> leyyin: Ehem, not on Arch. :)
[2015/12/17 16:51:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: What do i do with GDB; how do i use it?
[2015/12/17 16:51:18] <Karkus> head8debian: Oh, it's great fun
[2015/12/17 16:51:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't know :D
[2015/12/17 16:51:39] <leyyin> I suggest you use a visual debugger over gdb :P
[2015/12/17 16:51:45] <leyyin> Qt Creator is great
[2015/12/17 16:51:50] <head8debian> GOod grief.
[2015/12/17 16:52:16] <head8debian> GO_OD grief. :D
[2015/12/17 16:52:25] <leyyin> jolly fun dear sir
[2015/12/17 16:52:53] <Tobbi> Hmm, CPU usage is not the cause apparently...

[2015/12/17 16:54:14] <Tobbi> I know a bit about it.
[2015/12/17 16:54:21] <Tobbi> I know kind of how to debug crashes.
[2015/12/17 16:54:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: go?
[2015/12/17 16:54:32] <Tobbi> head8debian: enter that in the gdb window.
[2015/12/17 16:54:34] <Tobbi> And press enter.
[2015/12/17 16:54:43] <Tobbi> (I think)
[2015/12/17 16:55:03] <head8debian> "Command requires an argument".
[2015/12/17 16:55:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: then: run?
[2015/12/17 16:55:20] <Tobbi> without the question mark of course.
[2015/12/17 16:55:26] <head8debian> AH!
[2015/12/17 16:55:40] <head8debian> And it crashes.

[2015/12/17 17:03:07] <head8debian> I was wrong.
[2015/12/17 17:03:43] <Karkus> head8debian: Obviously a few tracks from supertux should feature
[2015/12/17 17:04:33] <Tobbi> head8debian: I can't find any anomalies...It seems to be loading images...

[2015/12/17 17:25:36] <Tobbi> It's due to langpack installation...

[2015/12/17 17:26:53] <head8debian> All was going good till it crashed.
[2015/12/17 17:28:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, could a GUI be added to notify why its freezing?
[2015/12/17 17:29:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: We could show the add-on download dialogue.
[2015/12/17 17:31:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Good idea.

[2015/12/17 21:59:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: Nice. :) Can you please test that langpacks get installed when selecting a different language?
[2015/12/17 21:59:25] <Tobbi> It should display dialogs briefly...

[2015/12/17 22:01:44] <Tobbi> And it did the same thing for me.
[2015/12/17 22:02:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: How do you use the language packs? I pretty download dialog popped up. :D
[2015/12/17 22:02:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: They get installed automatically.
[2015/12/17 22:02:52] <Tobbi> But it's good that the download dialog popped up.
[2015/12/17 22:02:55] <Tobbi> Exactly what I wanted.

[2015/12/17 22:03:09] <head8debian> D
[2015/12/17 22:03:36] <Tobbi> A download dialog is better than not displaying anything at all.
[2015/12/17 22:03:43] <Tobbi> head8debian: How long did the download dialog stay?
[2015/12/17 22:06:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: Untill i clicked close iirc.
[2015/12/17 22:06:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: It should close automatically...
[2015/12/17 22:06:20] <Tobbi> It didn't?
[2015/12/17 22:06:42] <head8debian> let me retry that.
[2015/12/17 22:07:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: Nope, i had to click close.
[2015/12/17 22:07:42] <head8debian> click "close".
[2015/12/17 22:07:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: Hmm, after download?

[2015/12/17 22:08:58] <head8debian> Tobbi: Looks like the download addon repository popup.

[2015/12/17 22:10:40] <head8debian> ok.
[2015/12/17 22:10:41] <Tobbi> I will probably make that dialog auto-close etc.
[2015/12/17 22:10:47] <Tobbi> And run at startup.
[2015/12/17 22:10:51] <Tobbi> So that it doesn't bother...
[2015/12/17 22:12:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whatever you think best.
[2015/12/17 22:14:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: My phone is comming appart at the seams. ;(
[2015/12/17 22:14:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: How old was it again?
[2015/12/17 22:14:46] <head8debian> Tobbi: 5 years.
[2015/12/17 22:14:53] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2015/12/17 22:14:53] <head8debian> Approaching 6.
[2015/12/17 22:15:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: The original HTC evo 4g. :) Awesome phone.
[2015/12/17 22:15:45] <Tobbi> Yes, it was...
[2015/12/17 22:15:56] <head8debian> I got it in not the best shape from a junk sale for $5.
[2015/12/17 22:16:35] <head8debian> I thought it would hold up better if i treated it well, but this is not very long.
[2015/12/17 22:16:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: 5 years?
[2015/12/17 22:16:55] <Tobbi> That's still long.
[2015/12/17 22:16:59] <head8debian> I should go back to using my computer and throw out my phone.
[2015/12/17 22:17:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Very long for a smartphone.
[2015/12/17 22:17:59] <Tobbi> Yes...
[2015/12/17 22:19:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im going to sleep , you should too.:)
[2015/12/17 22:20:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: it's only 4am.
[2015/12/17 22:21:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: only!?
[2015/12/17 22:21:31] <Tobbi> head8debian: You know...6 hours of sleep is sufficient for me.
[2015/12/17 22:21:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not for me. :)
[2015/12/17 22:22:08] <head8debian> Goodnight. :-)

[2015/12/18 00:22:58] <maths22> Karkus: That timing sounds good to me (at this point in time...I'm fairly certain I have nothing then)
[2015/12/18 00:25:02] <maths22> mt: Why the grudge against PHP? (Serious question, not trying to start an argument)

[2015/12/18 08:12:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: Language packs do install automatically after changing language. Problem is doing this at startup. It works, but it shows the addon menu, because the add-on menu is what's being shown when you need to update them.

[2015/12/18 08:49:12] <Tobbi> Karkus: Just drop it to the ~/.supertux2 directory.
[2015/12/18 08:49:25] <Tobbi> Or rather... ~/.supertux2/addons
[2015/12/18 08:49:26] <Tobbi> iirc.
[2015/12/18 08:50:36] <Tobbi> giby: You updated the translators manually, didn't you? You assembled a list from the po files, I assume?

[2015/12/18 10:51:46] <Tobbi> maths22: Could you package language add-ons with the installer executable? And then install the relevant add-on?
[2015/12/18 10:52:06] <Tobbi> target directory would be <supertux profile folder>/addons
[2015/12/18 10:52:24] <Tobbi> Maybe it's a bit too late for that, though.
[2015/12/18 11:03:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could certainly have one big sprite for each layer and then just copy the relevant parts from there. That means we only need to draw one sprite which should be substantially faster than drawing a couple of sprites.
[2015/12/18 11:03:58] <Tobbi> By copying I mean: If you add tiles, we change the sprite and update it.
[2015/12/18 11:04:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Would it be faster?

[2015/12/18 11:06:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: We would be drawing everything, even that which is hidden from view (zoomed in, etc.)
[2015/12/18 11:06:57] <Karkus> The editor hides all that at the moment
[2015/12/18 11:07:06] <Tobbi> right...

[2015/12/18 11:55:09] <Hume2> Karkus: We should consider how will it be with the editor.
[2015/12/18 11:55:43] <Karkus> Hume2: I'd be interested in helping you with the in-game editor
[2015/12/18 11:56:35] <Hume2> Karkus: Thanks! I could move that editor branch to origin, so anyone could contribute on it.
[2015/12/18 11:57:59] <Hume2> However it won't be merged with master until it will be finished.
[2015/12/18 11:58:53] <Karkus> Hume2: That sounds like a good idea
[2015/12/18 11:58:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, the rationale is that people who want to make minor / basic adjustments to levels will use the ingame editor, anyone else can use the python one, right?
[2015/12/18 11:59:12] <Hume2> Yes. Exactly.
[2015/12/18 11:59:18] <Tobbi> sounds good.
[2015/12/18 11:59:39] <Karkus> The in-game editor is for people who aren't interested in learning in detail about levels and scripting etc.

[2015/12/18 12:28:22] <Karkus> "ch" isn't in the alphabet by itself, only "c" and "h". Therefore "c" in "ch" puts it first
[2015/12/18 12:29:47] <Hume2> In Czech is "ch" between "h" and "i", so when I mess it up, just notify me.

[2015/12/18 12:31:12] <Hume2> I just ordered some includes and I messed it up because of this.

[2015/12/18 14:28:03] <mt> what basically happens: 1) make sure everything that's supposed to be in the release is included in master 2) write changelog, update NEWS.md + commit 3) run coverity test 4) create a 0.4.0 tag and a release/0.4 branch 5) building and packaging our binaries 6) make github release with release notes and binaries 5) social media announcements 6) notify distributions
[2015/12/18 14:28:21] <Hume2> I made a rule for suggesting worlds, won't it mind?
[2015/12/18 14:29:27] <Hume2> It's: If someone wants to suggest a world, then he should make it whole first (with some example levels) and then show it to the others. I really hate all those crappy world suggestions and the discussion arround, so this is a possible way how to improve that.
[2015/12/18 14:30:44] <brmbrmcar> Possibly. But then some good ideas could be ignored, due to lack of ability to make good levels.

[2015/12/18 14:34:35] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Working together with someone is allowed.
[2015/12/18 14:34:56] <brmbrmcar> I'd imagine.
[2015/12/18 14:35:15] <brmbrmcar> Well, yes.

[2015/12/18 14:36:07] <brmbrmcar> But making a whole world is still a massive task.
[2015/12/18 14:39:31] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes, but it's the only way how to get which level is good and which is bad.

[2015/12/18 22:28:06] <leper`> so he still hasn't handed out op privs
[2015/12/18 22:28:36] <head8debian> tux|dude: Huh?
[2015/12/18 22:28:49] <head8debian> leper`: Nope. :D I wish he would though.
[2015/12/18 22:29:00] <tux|dude> Well I quite wanted to see the forest world eventually get finished and added into the story
[2015/12/18 22:29:29] <head8debian> tux|dude: It is finshed, but not of the bonus worlds are in the story.
[2015/12/18 22:29:33] <leper`> head8debian: you could get everyone actively contributing to pause that unless he hands over that
[2015/12/18 22:29:39] <head8debian> tux|dude: The story is not even complete.
[2015/12/18 22:29:56] <leper`> (ok, that's kinda extortion, but might work given that he likes delegating work more than doing it)
[2015/12/18 22:29:56] <tux|dude> Oh right
[2015/12/18 22:30:05] <head8debian> leper`: He is fine. I can get OPs from other sources if i *need* them.
[2015/12/18 22:30:16] <tux|dude> Well it will be nice to see milestone 2 stable released 12 years after milestone 1 was released
[2015/12/18 22:30:35] <head8debian> tux|dude: Yes. THe story is not a huge part. :)
[2015/12/18 22:30:41] <tux|dude> Yeah lol
[2015/12/18 22:30:50] <tux|dude> Still it would be nice to get some more new worlds into the game
[2015/12/18 22:31:02] <tux|dude> And personally I also love the music in the forest world to death
[2015/12/18 22:31:03] <head8debian> tux|dude: True, but people need to make them to do that.
[2015/12/18 22:31:07] <head8debian> tux|dude: :)
[2015/12/18 22:31:09] <tux|dude> Yeah
[2015/12/18 22:31:14] <tux|dude> Pity I know jack shit about level design
[2015/12/18 22:31:22] <leper`> and a release is likely to get some traction for the project
[2015/12/18 22:31:45] <head8debian> tux|dude: We do have a third bonus world now, plus an extra island world.
[2015/12/18 22:31:47] <leper`> as in "I didn't know this thing was still going on"
[2015/12/18 22:31:59] <head8debian> leper`: Thats what we figure. :)
[2015/12/18 22:32:20] <tux|dude> Fingers crossed
[2015/12/18 22:32:26] <leper`> You do plan to be on time with the release, don't you?
[2015/12/18 22:32:42] <tux|dude> Hope it gains traction fast enough so milestone 3 comes out before 2025 or something haha
[2015/12/18 22:32:55] <leper`> (in that case I'll preemtively tell someone with access to our twitter to tell people about that)
[2015/12/18 22:33:47] <head8debian> leper`: No need, any of us can update the twitter.
[2015/12/18 22:33:49] <head8debian> :D
[2015/12/18 22:33:59] <head8debian> tux|dude: :D
[2015/12/18 22:34:21] <leper`> (the 0ad twitter might make a few more people see that thing though)
[2015/12/18 22:34:31] <leper`> (will tell him to retweet when something shows up)
[2015/12/18 22:34:45] <leper`> (given that I'm not going to be around then)
[2015/12/18 22:35:34] <head8debian> leper`: ok. thanks.
[2015/12/18 22:35:53] <tux|dude> Oh yeah is the firemans hat still going to be in 0.4.0? I heard people thought it was ugly haha
[2015/12/18 22:37:25] <head8debian> tux|dude: Yep.
[2015/12/18 22:37:32] <tux|dude> Welp
[2015/12/18 22:37:42] <leper`> firetux?
[2015/12/18 22:37:46] <head8debian> tux|dude: Huh?
[2015/12/18 22:37:49] <leper`> people think he's ugly?
[2015/12/18 22:37:57] <tux|dude> apparently
[2015/12/18 22:38:11] <leper`> did they think about getting new eyes?
[2015/12/18 22:38:13] <tux|dude> Quote "Tux superpowers: hat is really ugly and shall go, even old red-Tux was way better "
[2015/12/18 22:38:20] <tux|dude> Also
[2015/12/18 22:38:22] <tux|dude> "Tux rap in the intro: must not make its way into Milestone2 "
[2015/12/18 22:39:34] <head8debian> tux|dude: Well, it is. :)
[2015/12/18 22:39:37] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/12/18 22:39:39] <leper`> (given that being a firefighter helmet and tux throwing fire balls that might not make sense, but I didn't consider it to be ugly)
[2015/12/18 22:39:50] <leper`> (also helps getting people involved to fix things)
[2015/12/18 22:39:54] <tux|dude> I dunno. That was from the milestone 3 design document
[2015/12/18 22:40:03] <leper`> don't like it, submit a patch
[2015/12/18 22:40:22] <head8debian> tux|dude: Yeah... the old wiki is very messed up.
[2015/12/18 22:40:24] <leper`> sounds some ~10 years old :D
[2015/12/18 22:40:45] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/12/18 22:40:52] <tux|dude> Seriously though I have seen this game go through tons and tons of changes
[2015/12/18 22:40:58] <tux|dude> I played the original stable build
[2015/12/18 22:41:15] <head8debian> Im going to bed. gn all :)
[2015/12/18 22:41:16] <tux|dude> I played the development build where you had tux on the main screen in a workers hat and a shovel
[2015/12/18 22:41:28] <tux|dude> I've seen this game grow up quite a bit haha
[2015/12/18 22:42:03] <leper`> gn
[2015/12/18 22:42:47] <tux|dude> It's truly amazing to have seen this game grow up. It's like it has grown with me haha. Ever since I first played it when I was much younger
[2015/12/18 22:45:28] <leper`> we all were :D
[2015/12/18 22:46:16] <tux|dude> haha
[2015/12/18 22:46:37] <tux|dude> But yeah, seeing milestone 2 officially hit stable is something that my younger self has been waiting for for so long now
[2015/12/18 22:46:52] <leper`> that is indeed true
[2015/12/18 22:47:14] <leper`> always wanted more after having finished forest world for the first time
[2015/12/18 22:47:24] <leper`> and that might be reality sometime soonish
[2015/12/18 22:47:53] <tux|dude> Yeah
[2015/12/18 22:48:06] <tux|dude> I remember finishing the game when it was in milestone 1
[2015/12/18 22:48:14] <tux|dude> And then I played a bit of the forest worlfd
[2015/12/18 22:48:15] <tux|dude> *world
[2015/12/18 22:48:22] <tux|dude> Still haven't completed it fully though
[2015/12/18 22:48:31] <tux|dude> But some more levels cannon in the story would be awesome
[2015/12/18 22:48:40] <leper`> indeed
[2015/12/18 22:49:21] <leper`> possibly with some less natural biomes (eg some desert)
[2015/12/18 22:49:33] <tux|dude> Yeah
[2015/12/18 22:49:48] <tux|dude> Be cool to have some more out there worlds as well
[2015/12/18 22:49:58] <tux|dude> Like the ghost forest levels were really freaking cool
[2015/12/18 22:50:01] <leper`> also we all want to really save penny
[2015/12/18 22:50:06] <tux|dude> And I'd love to see the concepts behind that expanded
[2015/12/18 22:50:12] <tux|dude> My younger me demands it
[2015/12/18 22:50:58] <leper`> (and then someone will make supertux 2 (ok that might be taken by the current code, but still) and have nolok abduct her again)
[2015/12/18 22:51:43] <tux|dude> lol
[2015/12/18 22:52:03] <tux|dude> Still, I'd love to see some expansion done on some of the things such as the ghost forest as I freaking LOVED that concept
[2015/12/18 22:52:17] <leper`> those were nice
[2015/12/18 22:52:49] <tux|dude> Yeah. Although it seems from the milestone 3 design documents on the wiki that the actual concept was wanting to be more parallel universe like ahla link to the past
[2015/12/18 22:53:31] <leper`> well most of what's on there is quite old, so I guess it really depends on those who are contributing
[2015/12/18 22:53:34] <tux|dude> Yeah
[2015/12/18 22:53:41] <tux|dude> I think that would have been pretty cool though
[2015/12/18 22:54:26] <tux|dude> Hell I still have an uncanny attachment to the forest in general and I really wish I knew more about level design and this kinda stuff so I could help work on redoing the stuff that was a little rough around the edges so it could go into the main story
[2015/12/18 22:55:44] <leper`> well there is an editor and that shouldn't be too hard to try out
[2015/12/18 22:55:58] <tux|dude> Yeah, it's just I don't know too much about the fundimentals of level design
[2015/12/18 22:56:01] <leper`> (maybe draw some rough ideas on a piece of paper and then try to make something like that)
[2015/12/18 22:56:09] <leper`> start, platforming, end
[2015/12/18 22:56:15] <tux|dude> lol
[2015/12/18 22:56:16] <leper`> then expand :D
[2015/12/18 22:56:20] <tux|dude> Guess so
[2015/12/18 22:56:42] <tux|dude> because I'd love to try get the forest in a redone working state and with that cool ghost forest thing implimented
[2015/12/18 22:56:45] <leper`> and if someone plays it and complains a lot about something try to fix that one jump that is just too hard to do onto that moving platform
[2015/12/18 22:57:54] <tux|dude> Guess learning is the way of the game
[2015/12/18 22:58:26] <tux|dude> Also whee I did NOT know that there was a supertux port to android
[2015/12/18 22:58:45] <tux|dude> And holy shit it is basically running the whole damn computer version with extra levels and everything
[2015/12/18 23:01:53] <leper`> there is?
[2015/12/18 23:02:00] <tux|dude> Yes
[2015/12/18 23:02:06] <tux|dude> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lethargik.supertux2
[2015/12/18 23:04:32] <leper`> ah, given the source changes that mostly looks like it consists of SDL->SDL2 fixes
[2015/12/18 23:05:51] <leper`> and from looking at that it doesn't seem to add any levels anywhere I can see
[2015/12/18 23:06:12] <leper`> (it uses the git version as the base though)
[2015/12/18 23:06:22] <tux|dude> Yeah, it has all the built in extra level packs though
[2015/12/18 23:06:29] <tux|dude> The performance is debatable though
[2015/12/18 23:07:27] <tux|dude> Also debatable I find is the new music used in some of the areas in game...
[2015/12/18 23:07:32] <tux|dude> I dunno it just sounds a little...
[2015/12/18 23:07:33] <tux|dude> Meh
[2015/12/18 23:10:56] <tux|dude> I'm refering to all the voc songs
[2015/12/18 23:11:52] <leper`> hm
[2015/12/18 23:12:00] <leper`> can't remember hearing those
[2015/12/18 23:12:07] <tux|dude> Like, I dunno when you go from using Mortimers chipdisco (the theme that usually played in the ice world)
[2015/12/18 23:12:10] <tux|dude> to using the voc song
[2015/12/18 23:12:12] <tux|dude> Ew
[2015/12/18 23:12:16] <tux|dude> Like play the first level
[2015/12/18 23:12:20] <tux|dude> Then play the second level
[2015/12/18 23:12:24] <tux|dude> (in the ice world)
[2015/12/18 23:12:27] <tux|dude> You'll see what I mean
[2015/12/18 23:15:21] <tux|dude> It just feels super out of place with the rest of the music

[2015/12/19 02:12:47] <mt> we need that done before the release
[2015/12/19 02:15:16] <mt> Hume2 (if you're reading the log): the tiles seem to look ok, do you also have tilemap definition files (.strf)?
[2015/12/19 02:15:58] <mt> we could make a contest for levels with one of these themes
[2015/12/19 02:16:53] <mt> also, are those files derived so they'd need to be licensed under a share-alike license or are they truly public domain (you created them yourself + you don't care about what happens to them)
[2015/12/19 02:25:20] <mt> 0.4.0 will be stable, right?

[2015/12/19 05:16:42] <Hume2> Hello, brmbrmcar!
[2015/12/19 05:16:51] <brmbrmcar> Hi!
[2015/12/19 05:17:02] <mt> Hume2: see log, please
[2015/12/19 05:17:30] <Hume2> mt: What happened?
[2015/12/19 05:17:47] <mt> I have a few questions
[2015/12/19 05:17:56] <Hume2> Well, ask then.
[2015/12/19 05:18:02] <mt> see log
[2015/12/19 05:18:06] <mt> >_>
[2015/12/19 05:18:08] <Hume2> I see it.
[2015/12/19 05:18:21] <Hume2> And what's wrong with it?
[2015/12/19 05:18:31] <mt> the questions are in the log
[2015/12/19 05:20:06] <mt> summarized: a) .strf files for these tiles b) make a contest??? c) copied the tiles from existing ones under share-alike license or completely own work and you want it under public domain d) 0.4.0 will be stable, right?
[2015/12/19 05:20:45] <mt> e) what did you change in 'Bonus Island X: fixed ...'? f) draft release announcement to proofread/feedback: https://gist.github.com/maxteufel/d4a12ba9dabfcd0a3bc0
[2015/12/19 05:22:24] <Hume2> mt: In which commit those questions are? I still can't see it.
[2015/12/19 05:22:57] <mt> https://sydneyjd.github.io/logs/supertux.txt, very end of the logfile
[2015/12/19 05:23:28] <Hume2> Oh, that log.
[2015/12/19 05:23:36] <Hume2> I thought you mean git log.
[2015/12/19 05:27:19] <Hume2> mt: I added new tiles and I have also changed some tile definitions a bit.
[2015/12/19 05:27:33] <Hume2> The contest seems as a good idea.
[2015/12/19 05:28:03] <mt> that tiles is related to the Bonus Island fixes?
[2015/12/19 05:28:17] <Hume2> Some of them.
[2015/12/19 05:28:52] <Hume2> In fact, only four of them: Those frozen fishes on background.
[2015/12/19 05:30:19] <mt> I mean more like: I'd like a clarification of 'tiles' in 'I added new tiles and I have also changed some tile definitions a bit.'; are you talking about the zip you linked to with new tiles or about the changes in 'Bonus Island ... fixed ...'
[2015/12/19 05:31:15] <Hume2> No, they are other commits. And it's not the .zip file I linked yesterday.
[2015/12/19 05:31:49] <mt> what change are you talking about then?
[2015/12/19 05:32:11] <Hume2> mt: I added some missing tiles.
[2015/12/19 05:32:17] <mt> where to?
[2015/12/19 05:32:40] <Hume2> Missing jungle tiles, missing snow mountain tiles, missing jungle tiles ...
[2015/12/19 05:33:21] <mt> so you created an updated version of that zip with the tiles (or at least the content)?
[2015/12/19 05:35:01] <Hume2> mt: Well, what's your knowledge about the tiles we had there before? eg. in 0.3.5?
[2015/12/19 05:35:30] <mt> oh those tiles
[2015/12/19 05:35:40] <mt> however, I don't see any recent commits with changes to them
[2015/12/19 05:35:42] <mt> in master
[2015/12/19 05:36:06] <Hume2> It's a bit older.
[2015/12/19 05:36:27] <mt> then that comment was a bit out of context for me, sorry
[2015/12/19 05:36:47] <mt> so, could you try to answer at least some of my questions
[2015/12/19 05:37:04] <mt> a) - c) refers to the tiles in the zip
[2015/12/19 05:38:20] <Hume2> mt: I'll try to answer them.
[2015/12/19 05:39:00] <Hume2> d) Yes, at least Tobbi says that. And when Tobbi says that, it's true.
[2015/12/19 05:39:38] <Hume2> e) I guess the X stands for 1, 2 or 3, not for 10.
[2015/12/19 05:39:45] @ Quit: xet7: Ping timeout: 256 seconds
[2015/12/19 05:40:31] <mt> yes
[2015/12/19 05:40:52] <Hume2> For Bonus Island 1 and 2: I fixed the playability and extended the height.
[2015/12/19 05:41:09] <mt> ah
[2015/12/19 05:41:23] <Hume2> And for bonus Island 3: Only extended height and added paralax backgrounds where neccessary.
[2015/12/19 05:41:57] <Hume2> I'll now try to answer the f).
[2015/12/19 05:44:56] <Hume2> I'd just add that the old .strf files might not work in 0.4.0 because functional tiles are now done another way. I can explain you the change if you want.
[2015/12/19 05:45:54] <mt> sure

[2015/12/19 06:29:20] <Hume2> mt: Only a bit.
[2015/12/19 06:31:32] <mt> so what my actual question was, do you have any .strf files for the tiles in the zip?
[2015/12/19 06:33:24] <Hume2> mt: No, I don't have any.
[2015/12/19 06:33:33] <Hume2> Finally got what you mean.

[2015/12/19 06:33:49] <mt> because we'd need that for a level contest

[2015/12/19 07:18:22] <mt> Karkus: I just noticed flexlay should probably be 1.0.0 in the next release when you follow SemVer
[2015/12/19 07:19:08] <mt> since changing from the C++ API to Python *is* an "incompatible API change" imho

[2015/12/19 08:56:49] <Tobbi> leper`: I don't have the power to hand permanent ops to head8debian, otherwise I would.
[2015/12/19 08:57:07] <Tobbi> I don't have +A or whatever flag you need.

[2015/12/19 09:00:08] <brmbrmcar> Yeah, Tobbi is only +Oo.
[2015/12/19 09:00:27] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/12/19 09:00:56] <mt> what I think would be possible is automating clients to give other ops ops when receiving a message with password
[2015/12/19 09:01:38] <mt> that happens on networks without services, like efnet
[2015/12/19 09:04:01] <Tobbi> mt: That would mean having a bouncer for me.
[2015/12/19 09:04:06] <Tobbi> (right?)
[2015/12/19 09:04:10] <mt> nope
[2015/12/19 09:04:17] <brmbrmcar> What script would that use?
[2015/12/19 09:04:21] <Tobbi> phew...
[2015/12/19 09:04:30] <Tobbi> Hume2: Honestly, I don't want to be a dictator...
[2015/12/19 09:04:32] <mt> basically every op has a script running in their client
[2015/12/19 09:05:13] <Tobbi> Hume2: I don't like to dictate. I just believe that after more than 10 years and the game being pretty stable, a Milestone 2 release is justified.
[2015/12/19 09:05:16] <mt> that script, verifies other ops' hostnames on join and if they match, that user will get ops
[2015/12/19 09:05:35] <mt> so everyone will be able to op all other ops
[2015/12/19 09:05:45] <Hume2> Tobbi: I know, you just seem me very clever.
[2015/12/19 09:06:11] <mt> that would however mean that there needs to be always at least one person in the channel with ops
[2015/12/19 09:06:11] <Tobbi> Thanks. I'll just take that as a compliment :)
[2015/12/19 09:06:17] <Tobbi> Now let me continue reading the backlog.
[2015/12/19 09:08:57] <Tobbi> head8debian: Also, I can't do what I want with it :D
[2015/12/19 09:09:03] <Tobbi> Okay, read through the logs.
[2015/12/19 09:11:11] <Tobbi> mt: I guess I will update the credits now, unless you thrive for some boring work...
[2015/12/19 09:11:17] <Tobbi> First the commit credits :)
[2015/12/19 09:11:51] <mt> the main thing with the credits is:
[2015/12/19 09:12:00] <mt> there's some names from Milestone 1
[2015/12/19 09:12:08] <mt> however I don't know if that code's still used
[2015/12/19 09:12:15] <Tobbi> oh, yeah...
[2015/12/19 09:12:34] <mt> I thought about creating an additional section 'Milestone 1 contributions by...'
[2015/12/19 09:12:36] <mt> but meh
[2015/12/19 09:13:00] <Tobbi> mt: Can you do that? You'd save me a lot of trouble there.
[2015/12/19 09:13:26] <mt> I can but I don't know which authors to put there >_>
[2015/12/19 09:13:53] <Tobbi> mt: Use your best judgement ;)
[2015/12/19 09:18:45] @ Quit: Hume2: Quit: Page closed
[2015/12/19 09:24:07] <Tobbi> mt: Can you also include a note to install the latest language pack manually into the credits and look for updates once in a while?
[2015/12/19 09:24:25] <Tobbi> since langpacks are using our add-on subsystem
[2015/12/19 09:26:07] <mt> I *can*, do you want me to?
[2015/12/19 09:26:22] <mt> btw, did you see my draft release announcement/notes
[2015/12/19 09:28:26] <Tobbi> mt: Yes, I did :)
[2015/12/19 09:28:30] <Tobbi> That's why I am asking.
[2015/12/19 09:28:45] <Tobbi> mt: And by include I mean: Include in the release notes.
[2015/12/19 09:28:52] <Tobbi> Unless you know a better place where to stick it.
[2015/12/19 09:28:57] <mt> oh
[2015/12/19 09:29:04] <mt> you said 'into the credits'
[2015/12/19 09:29:12] <Tobbi> mt: Oh, not in the credits, no.
[2015/12/19 09:29:23] <Tobbi> mt: You know post-release-day-confusion.

[2015/12/19 09:34:20] <mt> I hate the credits file
[2015/12/19 09:34:36] <mt> now that I have some authors it doesn't get the correct style I want
[2015/12/19 09:36:45] <mt> so
[2015/12/19 09:36:50] <mt> if someone wants to fix that
[2015/12/19 09:37:05] <mt> make a section "Milestone 1 contributions by..."

[2015/12/19 10:00:35] <alket> When a bomb is above "?" box and when you jump on a it and it starts ticking, then you go under "?" block and hit it, it starts ticking again from begining
[2015/12/19 10:01:14] <Tobbi> alket: I see...
[2015/12/19 10:01:30] <Tobbi> alket: We will fix it for 0.4.1
[2015/12/19 10:01:33] <Tobbi> No time for 0.4.0

[2015/12/19 10:02:39] <mt> my solution for the logs
[2015/12/19 10:02:52] <mt> however you need to wait 30s between visits
[2015/12/19 10:02:58] <mt> that affects all users, not per IP

[2015/12/19 10:07:31] <mt> since head8debian's logs are updated using a cronjob every 15 minutes iirc I made a Flask/Python script today
[2015/12/19 10:07:33] <alket> Time limit reached, try again later.
[2015/12/19 10:07:45] <mt> yep that's intended after the second visit
[2015/12/19 10:08:19] <mt> since the logfile is not cached
[2015/12/19 10:09:28] <mt> I'm very paranoid about that script
[2015/12/19 10:09:45] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux

[2015/12/19 10:11:24] <Tobbi> alket: That explosion is cool, not sure whether it fits our style, though.
[2015/12/19 10:11:26] <mt> head8debian: they don't update immediately

[2015/12/19 10:11:46] <alket> another "bug", if you are "grown" but no ability to shoot, you open the "flower" then get hit and become small, then you get the flower , you grow and get the ability to shoot
[2015/12/19 10:12:09] <mt> is that a bug?
[2015/12/19 10:12:14] <mt> I think that's expected
[2015/12/19 10:12:28] <alket> mt: you should just grow
[2015/12/19 10:12:38] <mt> why?
[2015/12/19 10:12:51] <alket> because you are not grown hehe
[2015/12/19 10:13:08] <mt> why shouldn't it be possible to grow + get a flower

[2015/12/19 10:24:53] <mt> you enable developer mode, choose a key for the cheat console and there you'll find a reset button
[2015/12/19 10:25:14] <Karkus> Well, you could do that, of course
[2015/12/19 10:25:25] <Karkus> But then maybe you shouldn't need developer mode...
[2015/12/19 10:26:35] <alket> Karkus: linux

[2015/12/19 10:27:38] <Karkus> mt: Depends on the build type iirc
[2015/12/19 10:27:57] <Karkus> Automatically enabled if it's a debug build
[2015/12/19 10:28:34] <Karkus> As in, if you build from source as usual, it will be enabled. If you get a release version, it shouldn't be enabled.

[2015/12/19 12:05:05] <mt> or rather, half of the builds show "Coverity Scan analysis NOT authorized until Sat, 19 Dec 2015 16:56:19 +0000 UTC."

[2015/12/19 12:05:27] <Tobbi> No, that's not good.

[2015/12/19 12:28:34] <Karkus> mt: Yes, should I do that?
[2015/12/19 12:28:41] <Karkus> Annoying, but possible
[2015/12/19 12:28:58] <mt> or you remove the code from the editor
[2015/12/19 12:29:09] <mt> but create a python script that makes use of flexlay's API
[2015/12/19 12:29:21] <mt> which can convert the old worldmaps to new ones

[2015/12/19 12:34:03] <Karkus> mt: Do you know where I can find an old worldmap for testing?
[2015/12/19 12:34:18] <mt> in an old revision of the git repo
[2015/12/19 12:34:35] <Karkus> How old?
[2015/12/19 12:34:43] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/supertux-milestone1/data/levels/worldmaps/world1.stwm
[2015/12/19 12:34:50] <mt> I don't know if that's old enough
[2015/12/19 12:35:23] <Karkus> Yep. I'm looking at the code which creates that comment.
[2015/12/19 12:36:28] <mt> ah yeah should be old enough, the new ones seem to start with (supertux-level
[2015/12/19 12:37:32] <Karkus> mt: Yeah, this is what I'm implementing.
[2015/12/19 12:37:57] <mt> just the warning? or also the converter?
[2015/12/19 12:39:21] <mt> I mean ideally you'd have a function that imports the old worldmaps and results in the same datastructure as the functions for the new levels/worldmaps
[2015/12/19 12:39:44] <mt> then you pass the data structure to the function that writes new worldmaps
[2015/12/19 12:45:27] <mt> I actually think it doesn't even save the worldmaps
[2015/12/19 12:45:34] <mt> since there's no save_worldmap()
[2015/12/19 12:48:47] <Karkus> mt: It does. In the current version of supertux, worldmaps are exactly the same as levels, except with some unique objects
[2015/12/19 12:48:53] <Karkus> mt: I understand the concept.
[2015/12/19 12:48:54] <mt> yep
[2015/12/19 12:49:06] <mt> but it doesn't save old worldmaps I guess?
[2015/12/19 12:49:25] <Karkus> The warning will show, offering the option to load or cancel
[2015/12/19 12:49:44] <Karkus> Then it will load, but saving will only save as the new worldmaps
[2015/12/19 12:49:56] <Hume2> Can be.
[2015/12/19 12:49:58] <Karkus> As it will have been loaded as a level
[2015/12/19 12:50:21] <Hume2> There's no reason to save it in old format.
[2015/12/19 12:50:31] <mt> well, Exception: Error: '/tmp/world1-old.stwm' is not a 'supertux-level' file is what happens with the current version
[2015/12/19 12:50:40] <mt> when trying to open it
[2015/12/19 12:51:27] <mt> So, there's no reason to add the ability to open them when it's not already supported
[2015/12/19 12:51:32] <mt> I thought it was supported
[2015/12/19 12:51:38] <mt> but apparently it isn't

[2015/12/19 13:06:58] <Karkus> Excluding LTS releases, for example
[2015/12/19 13:07:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: We aren't changing it, of course.

[2015/12/19 13:07:32] <Tobbi> Okay, what's next...updating credits.
[2015/12/19 13:07:37] <Tobbi> How do we do that?
[2015/12/19 13:07:41] <Tobbi> Structure-wise I mean.
[2015/12/19 13:07:43] <mt> 1.0.0 might be ok for that would be what could be 0.6.0 as well
[2015/12/19 13:08:40] <mt> Tobbi: well, I thought: remove those who haven't done anything since M1, add a special category: "Milestone 1 contributions by..."
[2015/12/19 13:08:54] <mt> That seem to be these people https://zerobin.net/?5b5883108a000110#A+hoq7LRrAbeTnr63+eXJ7hGD8DhD1vcPd1tWYR7Ggw=
[2015/12/19 13:09:28] <Tobbi> mt: Okay, can you do that, or do I need to delegate those tedious tasks to head8debian again? (old times sake)
[2015/12/19 13:09:37] <mt> head8debian:
[2015/12/19 13:09:53] <mt> I already tried to get that formatted correctly actually
[2015/12/19 13:09:57] <mt> but it doesn't work
[2015/12/19 13:10:39] <mt> I wanted these people to be written in a normal-size font, not as small as the translators part
[2015/12/19 13:10:51] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/12/19 13:12:03] <Karkus> mt: But "Tobgle Road" is an M2 level, even though he hasn't contributed since M1?
[2015/12/19 13:12:20] <mt> Tobgle Road already existed in M1

[2015/12/19 13:51:09] <Tobbi> right?
[2015/12/19 13:51:14] <mt> nah
[2015/12/19 13:51:15] <Tobbi> Or did you take 0.1.9?
[2015/12/19 13:51:31] <mt> I just looked if the contribution was before 2005 or so
[2015/12/19 13:51:41] <Tobbi> I see
[2015/12/19 13:52:50] <Tobbi> mt: Can you please assemble a list with people AND their contributions so that I can give a proper summary?
[2015/12/19 13:53:17] <mt> and their contributions, well, do you want me to look at all 6000 commits?
[2015/12/19 13:53:30] <Tobbi> mt: Oh, you made that manually? I was using git shortlog.
[2015/12/19 13:54:07] <mt> well I can't value a commit from its message right?
[2015/12/19 13:54:44] <Tobbi> mt: No, but a message would probably indicate what the user contributed.
[2015/12/19 13:54:59] <mt> I'd still have to read 6000 messages
[2015/12/19 13:55:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: s/would/should
[2015/12/19 13:55:12] <Tobbi> Karkus: right...

[2015/12/19 13:55:38] <Tobbi> range: 0.1.3..HEAD, right?
[2015/12/19 13:58:35] <mt> 0.1.3 was tagged somewhen 2010, not at the actual release
[2015/12/19 13:58:39] <mt> it's a bit messy
[2015/12/19 13:58:48] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/12/19 13:59:01] <Tobbi> I give up.
[2015/12/19 14:00:11] <Tobbi> When was the release of 0.1.3 again?
[2015/12/19 14:00:26] <Hume2> 2004 I guess.
[2015/12/19 14:00:56] <Tobbi> I have it now.
[2015/12/19 14:01:04] <Tobbi> There's --since in the git shortlog command.
[2015/12/19 14:06:05] <mt> yay https://zerobin.net/?c9bd127f8aa53b72#r5kRhnk283lHSS1++xpxFBUCbVetm+5wJFGLL6u3OcA=
[2015/12/19 14:07:22] <mt> now I wrote a script that checks if [ci skip] is in the commit message, if not, it sets up a temp file where you write p/a/c into, and once something gets written to that file, it checks what was written. p simply continues, a adds \n\n[ci skip], c cancels the commit
[2015/12/19 14:08:15] <mt> for some reason, git doesn't allow interactive input in that script
[2015/12/19 14:10:32] <Tobbi> mt: How would I name the "Other contributions" section?
[2015/12/19 14:10:41] <Tobbi> Smaller contributions sounds...not good.
[2015/12/19 14:10:49] <mt> yep
[2015/12/19 14:10:55] <mt> or "Additional contributions"
[2015/12/19 14:11:36] <Tobbi> Yeah.
[2015/12/19 14:11:39] <Tobbi> That's good.
[2015/12/19 14:13:17] <Tobbi> mt: What should I credit you for, anyway?
[2015/12/19 14:13:36] <mt> dunno

[2015/12/19 14:13:57] <mt> "Coordination"?
[2015/12/19 14:14:47] <Tobbi> Sure.

[2015/12/19 15:48:34] <mt> want me to put the changelog in NEWS.md?
[2015/12/19 15:48:40] <mt> and if so, which one?
[2015/12/19 15:48:44] <Karkus> mt: I made a comment
[2015/12/19 15:48:54] <mt> the v0.1.3 <-> v0.4.0
[2015/12/19 15:49:04] <mt> or the v0.3.5(a) <-> v0.4.0
[2015/12/19 15:49:12] <Tobbi> good question...
[2015/12/19 15:49:39] <mt> yeah how does one look for updates?
[2015/12/19 15:49:44] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/19 15:50:09] <Karkus> mt: Hence issue #270 :)
[2015/12/19 15:50:19] <mt> "You should regularly reinstall the language pack from the add-on manager to keep the localization up-to-date."?
[2015/12/19 15:50:50] <Karkus> mt: "may want to" rather than "should"
[2015/12/19 15:51:23] <Karkus> I don't want to imply you should keep clicking it until it's translated to 100%
[2015/12/19 15:52:49] @ Quit: lumidify: Client Quit
[2015/12/19 15:53:48] <Tobbi> mt: You can update NEWS.md with changes for 0.4.0 but date it to tomorrow.
[2015/12/19 15:53:59] <Tobbi> Or maybe have a pull request that can be merged easily.
[2015/12/19 15:54:03] <Tobbi> or..I don't know.
[2015/12/19 15:54:49] <mt> nah it'll be fine the former way
[2015/12/19 15:55:15] <mt> but - the M1 <-> M2 changelog or the v0.3.5a <-> v0.4.0 changelog?
[2015/12/19 15:55:37] <mt> also, 0.4.0 will be stable, right?
[2015/12/19 15:55:41] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/12/19 15:57:27] <Karkus> I would say what we have now is fairly stable, all things considered.
[2015/12/19 15:57:54] <Tobbi> I agree...

[2015/12/19 16:08:38] <Tobbi> That would mean: 18 hours until release.
[2015/12/19 16:09:19] <Karkus> Are we ready to build yet? Then we can get some tests done.
[2015/12/19 16:09:37] <Karkus> Or tag 0.4.0?
[2015/12/19 16:09:41] <Tobbi> I am not sure.
[2015/12/19 16:09:51] <Tobbi> Karkus: I wonder why there's no release number shown in SuperTux anymore.
[2015/12/19 16:09:57] <Tobbi> At the bottom left corner.
[2015/12/19 16:11:05] <Karkus> Hmmm...
[2015/12/19 16:12:02] <mt> uh
[2015/12/19 16:12:21] <mt> maybe fix that or at least add a last minute --version flag
[2015/12/19 16:12:33] <mt> because otherwise there's no possibility to find the version
[2015/12/19 16:13:14] <Tobbi> *sigh* okay, we need to do one more translation update.

[2015/12/19 16:23:10] <mt> are they included in the add-on or in the language pack?
[2015/12/19 16:23:44] <Tobbi> mt: The preferred way is the language pack.
[2015/12/19 16:23:46] <Tobbi> But both works.
[2015/12/19 16:24:28] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/243 looks like "ah, there's still so much to do"
[2015/12/19 16:24:47] <mt> but then you think "better wait until shortly before the release"

[2015/12/19 18:02:49] <giby> Hi Tobbi
[2015/12/19 18:02:55] <Tobbi> Hey giby
[2015/12/19 18:03:14] <giby> so tomorrow you release M2?
[2015/12/19 18:03:20] <Tobbi> giby: Yes. And translations are updated.
[2015/12/19 18:03:30] <Tobbi> Credits as well.
[2015/12/19 18:03:32] <giby> Cool
[2015/12/19 18:03:50] <Tobbi> giby: I picked the translator credits manually from the backlog..
[2015/12/19 18:04:04] <giby> I was late to do it....
[2015/12/19 18:04:05] <Tobbi> Aka, the transifex backlog.
[2015/12/19 18:04:07] <Tobbi> No problem.
[2015/12/19 18:04:15] <Tobbi> I'm glad when this is done.
[2015/12/19 18:04:20] <giby> I get issus with my new computer
[2015/12/19 18:05:12] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2015/12/19 18:23:20] <giby> so I don't have anything to do for the release
[2015/12/19 18:24:05] <Tobbi> giby: If you want, you can check whether everything was updated correctly...
[2015/12/19 18:24:23] <giby> :p
[2015/12/19 18:25:14] <Tobbi> giby: I think I did everything correctly...language packs work...
[2015/12/19 18:25:14] <Tobbi> etc.
[2015/12/19 18:26:00] <leper`> Tobbi: ah, I though you could hand that out
[2015/12/19 18:26:11] <leper`> (and you seem to love delegating, or at least claim to)
[2015/12/19 18:26:32] <Tobbi> leper`: Maybe there was a miscommunication. I wasn't quite sure whether giby would show up...
[2015/12/19 18:26:39] <Tobbi> So, to be safe, I updated it myself.

[2015/12/19 18:39:03] <Tobbi> Oh, yes
[2015/12/19 18:39:04] <Tobbi> Alright.

[2015/12/19 18:43:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Change Stable: to 0.4.0 and remove beta
[2015/12/19 18:43:44] <Tobbi> Okay, I will.

[2015/12/19 18:43:53] <Tobbi> Well, alright.

[2015/12/19 18:44:22] <Karkus> Well, if anyone joins, I will tell them immediately that there are still a few hours till release.
[2015/12/19 18:44:38] <Tobbi> Yes, indeed.
[2015/12/19 18:45:05] <alket> does anything needs testing ?
[2015/12/19 18:46:13] <Tobbi> alket: Compile the code and see for yourself.
[2015/12/19 18:49:33] <alket> how can I check how many lifes do I have
[2015/12/19 18:53:26] @ Quit: Tobbi: 
[2015/12/19 18:56:54] <alket> a new bug, if a "?" box is near a breakable wooden box, when you jump to break it, the flower in next box falls down, you have to be in middle of 2 boxes https://lut.im/cb35gdoqgZ/JKDciOKCo7iU8Ixy.png
[2015/12/19 18:57:08] <alket> you can also get coins this way
[2015/12/19 18:58:08] <Karkus> alket: Lives? Lives do not exist.
[2015/12/19 18:58:21] <alket> life ?
[2015/12/19 18:58:48] <Karkus> alket: When you die you lose coins. You can die as much as you like.
[2015/12/19 18:59:06] <Karkus> lifes = lives
[2015/12/19 18:59:14] <alket> so why are there lives to pick up ?
[2015/12/19 18:59:20] <Karkus> Huh?
[2015/12/19 18:59:26] <Karkus> Where?
[2015/12/19 18:59:37] <alket> like on each level
[2015/12/19 18:59:47] <Karkus> What do they look like?
[2015/12/19 18:59:52] <alket> small tux doll
[2015/12/19 19:00:01] <Karkus> That gives you 100 coins
[2015/12/19 19:01:53] <alket> tna
[2015/12/19 19:01:55] <alket> thanks
[2015/12/19 19:01:58] <alket> its a bit missleading
[2015/12/19 19:02:09] <Karkus> It should say it on the first level.
[2015/12/19 19:02:12] <Karkus> Did you play it?
[2015/12/19 19:02:22] <alket> yes it does, but I only read them when im stuck :p
[2015/12/19 19:02:49] <Karkus> alket: Right. Maybe we should add a sign. Not now, though.

[2015/12/20 02:51:51] <mt> should I add a unit test for the --version problem?

[2015/12/20 03:43:07] <tux|dude> When is the release then?
[2015/12/20 03:47:30] <mt> We planned 16:00 UTC+1
[2015/12/20 03:48:07] <mt> Hume2: I don't think the editor should be in 0.4.1
[2015/12/20 03:48:21] <mt> adding an editor is not just a bugfix
[2015/12/20 03:48:35] <Hume2> mt: We'll see.
[2015/12/20 03:48:54] <Hume2> Changed to 0.5.0.
[2015/12/20 03:49:35] <mt> Also uh I can't run our unit tests in the homebrew formula test step
[2015/12/20 03:49:55] <mt> because according to their documentation the test step creates a new temp dir

[2015/12/20 03:54:48] <mt> they need to be in a list and there needs to be text after them
[2015/12/20 03:54:50] <mt> like:

[2015/12/20 04:22:52] <mt> I noticed there's some duplicate levels in Bonus Island III and Incubator Island

[2015/12/20 04:25:53] <Tobbi> mt: Thanks for that version string fix.
[2015/12/20 04:27:18] <mt> however with that we'll need to make sure we'll build after tagging 0.4.0 in master
[2015/12/20 04:27:41] <Tobbi> mt: Yes, my plan exactly.
[2015/12/20 04:27:44] <mt> because currently it's v0.3.5-61x-(hash)
[2015/12/20 04:28:45] <Hume2> mt: What is the 61x?
[2015/12/20 04:29:22] <mt> 611 right now
[2015/12/20 04:29:33] <mt> the number of commits since the v0.3.5 tag
[2015/12/20 04:29:44] <Hume2> That's clever.
[2015/12/20 04:29:45] <Tobbi> mt: Why did the build fail with -DWERROR=ON?

[2015/12/20 04:38:01] <mt> well the nightlies are -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
[2015/12/20 04:38:12] <mt> so we could just take the builds of that tag
[2015/12/20 04:38:19] <Tobbi> Oh, they are. Good.
[2015/12/20 04:39:11] <Tobbi> That's an interesting warning.
[2015/12/20 04:39:18] <Tobbi> In fact, I've never seen that before.
[2015/12/20 04:40:06] <mt> however, the nighly builds don't exist in a win64 version

[2015/12/20 05:48:29] <mt> 0.5.0 is what we plan to make happen after the 0.4 series
[2015/12/20 05:48:53] <mt> 0.4.1 is what should be in the next bugfix release
[2015/12/20 05:49:18] <mt> '0.6.0' will be probably declared stable enough to make it '1.0.0'
[2015/12/20 05:49:19] <brmbrmcar> But some things planned for 0.4.1 now display 0.5.0.
[2015/12/20 05:49:39] <mt> anything that's more than a bugfix is 0.5.0
[2015/12/20 05:49:43] <brmbrmcar> 0.6.0 will be WAY before 1.0.0.
[2015/12/20 05:50:11] <mt> you know we don't need 0.9.0 for 1.0.0
[2015/12/20 05:50:11] <brmbrmcar> 1.0.0 is after milestone 3.
[2015/12/20 05:50:29] <mt> and we don't try to use milestones anymore
[2015/12/20 05:50:33] <Tobbi> No shit, sherlock.

[2015/12/20 05:51:25] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: This release day is busy enough, even without you bugging us about things which really don't take precedence over other things.
[2015/12/20 05:51:54] <Tobbi> ville
[2015/12/20 05:51:54] <Tobbi> Tobbi: because c++ types can hold only limited value of ranges the order in which an expression is evaluated can affect the results
[2015/12/20 05:51:54] <Tobbi> ville
[2015/12/20 05:51:56] <Tobbi> err range of values
[2015/12/20 05:52:06] <Tobbi> Tobbi: so a + b - c is not necessarily same as if it was ordered in some order not lef-to-right although mathematically speaking you're free to do so
[2015/12/20 05:52:12] <Tobbi> Does this make any sense to you?
[2015/12/20 05:52:32] <Tobbi> In the context of the error above, I mean?
[2015/12/20 05:52:39] <mt> what
[2015/12/20 05:53:00] <mt> are they suggesting a+b-c isn't the same as b+a-c
[2015/12/20 05:53:10] <Tobbi> mt: I don't know :D
[2015/12/20 05:55:24] <Tobbi> mt: Build without Werror...I really don't know how to fix it and I don't want to fix it now, either.

[2015/12/20 06:31:53] <alket> Tobbi: a new bug, if a "?" box is near a breakable wooden box, when you jump to break it, the flower in next box falls down, you have to be in middle of 2 boxes https://lut.im/cb35gdoqgZ/JKDciOKCo7iU8Ixy.png
[2015/12/20 06:32:08] <alket> this also works for coin boxes etc
[2015/12/20 06:32:24] <mt> Tobbi: do we want to remove that reference to Milestone 3 and replace it with "soon" oslt in credits?
[2015/12/20 06:32:37] <brmbrmcar> Where's the bug, alket?
[2015/12/20 06:32:45] <brmbrmcar> That is normal!
[2015/12/20 06:32:59] <alket> brmbrmcar: how come ?
[2015/12/20 06:33:17] <alket> if you jump and hold down the key in "?" it doesn't work, only when you are half in "?" box and half in wooden box
[2015/12/20 06:33:38] <mt> what happens when you jump on the "?" while pressing down?
[2015/12/20 06:33:44] <Tobbi> mt: I think it's okay the way it is ;)
[2015/12/20 06:33:54] <alket> mt: nothing

[2015/12/20 06:40:16] <Tobbi> Schroedinbug.
[2015/12/20 06:42:01] <Tobbi> This buildsystem is his destiny. He said "Shut up and build for me".

[2015/12/20 06:55:32] <Tobbi> Hello Karkus.

[2015/12/20 06:55:43] <Karkus> Hey Tobbi
[2015/12/20 06:55:44] <Tobbi> Karkus: Mentally ready for release?
[2015/12/20 06:55:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: I think so
[2015/12/20 06:56:12] <Tobbi> Good.
[2015/12/20 06:56:22] <Tobbi> It's gonna be quite disturbing, awesome, otherworldly...
[2015/12/20 06:56:44] <Tobbi> Who is going to win this time? We or the build system? :P
[2015/12/20 06:57:08] <Tobbi> Or is it "us" in this context?
[2015/12/20 06:57:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: I hope it's not any of those descriptions
[2015/12/20 06:57:36] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 06:58:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, "We or the build system?" isn't a sentence anyway. Normal rules don't apply
[2015/12/20 06:58:26] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2015/12/20 06:58:50] <leyyin> wine 1.8 was released :D
[2015/12/20 06:59:14] <Tobbi> leyyin: ...
[2015/12/20 06:59:29] <Tobbi> leyyin: You make that fuzz about wine 1.8...but nothing about SuperTux 0.4
[2015/12/20 06:59:38] <Tobbi> I hope you guys will at least give us a retweet or something.
[2015/12/20 06:59:52] <leyyin> I do not play supertux that much :/
[2015/12/20 07:01:01] <Tobbi> leyyin: Saying this in the #supertux channel calls for capital punishment, you know that... :P
[2015/12/20 07:01:11] <leyyin> I do not play STK either
[2015/12/20 07:02:01] <leyyin> who here plays supertux everyday?
[2015/12/20 07:02:02] <Tobbi> leyyin: You don't? :D
[2015/12/20 07:02:05] <leyyin> let's be honest
[2015/12/20 07:02:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: me.
[2015/12/20 07:02:08] <Tobbi> For debugging purposes.
[2015/12/20 07:02:37] <leyyin> you commplete levels and such?
[2015/12/20 07:02:43] <leyyin> or only test something then exit
[2015/12/20 07:02:48] <leyyin> two different things
[2015/12/20 07:03:12] <leyyin> playing a game != testing a game
[2015/12/20 07:04:01] <Karkus> leyyin: Sometimes I will just randomly play levels, yes.
[2015/12/20 07:04:14] <leyyin> "sometimes"
[2015/12/20 07:04:28] <Karkus> leyyin: I run the level from Flexlay and then have to complete it :)
[2015/12/20 07:04:38] <leyyin> that is testing it :P
[2015/12/20 07:04:45] <Tobbi> leyyin: I complete levels because of OCD.
[2015/12/20 07:04:51] <leyyin> hahaha
[2015/12/20 07:04:55] <leyyin> sad :D
[2015/12/20 07:05:29] <leyyin> I think the problem with most open source games is that they are not addicting
[2015/12/20 07:05:31] <Tobbi> leyyin: Also, you know, I made a new cover version: Instead of "Shutup and build for me", it now is "Oh, I think I have found myself a build system. She is always right there when I need her"
[2015/12/20 07:05:48] <Tobbi> And when you now ask why a build system is female...well...
[2015/12/20 07:05:54] <Tobbi> Complicated things are always female.
[2015/12/20 07:05:58] <leyyin> we will have a huge fan base if the game were addicting
[2015/12/20 07:06:55] <Karkus> leyyin: Right. How do you make SuperTux addicting?
[2015/12/20 07:07:11] <lumidify> Story: the key to making something addicting.
[2015/12/20 07:07:45] <Tobbi> lumidify: How can the story not be addicting: Poor Penny being abducted makes me wanna SMASH NOLOK'S BEHIND WITH FULL FORCE.
[2015/12/20 07:07:53] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 07:07:54] <Karkus> I think we need better prizes
[2015/12/20 07:07:59] <leyyin> omg :D
[2015/12/20 07:08:10] <leyyin> Karkus, that is the right question, I do not have the answer
[2015/12/20 07:08:17] <Karkus> Oh yay, I found a tux doll -_-
[2015/12/20 07:08:23] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 07:08:35] <lumidify> There could be some shop to get permanent upgrades.
[2015/12/20 07:08:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: Make the background colours flash randomly when someone found a tux doll...
[2015/12/20 07:08:47] <Tobbi> Is Mario addicting?
[2015/12/20 07:08:49] <Karkus> Especially when coins do nothing
[2015/12/20 07:09:11] <lumidify> I only play SuperTux, now Mario, so I don't know.
[2015/12/20 07:09:19] <Tobbi> Hmm, okay...
[2015/12/20 07:09:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes
[2015/12/20 07:09:21] <lumidify> I meant "not", not "now".
[2015/12/20 07:09:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: What makes it more addicting? :P
[2015/12/20 07:09:41] <leyyin> open source games are unicorns
[2015/12/20 07:09:51] <Karkus> Each level has a unique feature, Tobbi
[2015/12/20 07:09:56] <Tobbi> That's interesting.
[2015/12/20 07:10:13] <Karkus> As in, some levels have features which are never reused
[2015/12/20 07:10:18] <mt> that means more scripting levels?
[2015/12/20 07:10:20] <Karkus> Keeps it interesting
[2015/12/20 07:10:29] <leyyin> http://store.steampowered.com/app/380840/
[2015/12/20 07:10:32] <Tobbi> mt: Yes, more scripting levels and features.
[2015/12/20 07:10:48] <Karkus> mt: I really loved playing light+magic
[2015/12/20 07:11:00] <leyyin> "956 all-time peak"
[2015/12/20 07:11:05] <Karkus> That wasn't scripted, and could be reused
[2015/12/20 07:11:08] <mt> then what's some of these features?
[2015/12/20 07:11:21] <mt> we need some inspiration!

[2015/12/20 07:11:36] <leyyin> I consider teeworlds addicting :)
[2015/12/20 07:11:54] <Karkus> mt: Watch a playthrough of mario.
[2015/12/20 07:12:02] <Karkus> Any recent mario
[2015/12/20 07:12:17] <Karkus> Not fully, just skip through
[2015/12/20 07:12:19] <Tobbi> We can have this discussion at the meeting next year...
[2015/12/20 07:12:20] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/20 07:12:27] <Karkus> Each level has a 'topic'
[2015/12/20 07:12:27] <Tobbi> Really, right now: Concentrate on release.
[2015/12/20 07:12:30] <leyyin> the problem with copying is that you will be just a mario copy, you must bring something new
[2015/12/20 07:13:00] <leyyin> Tobbi, release note for 0.4?
[2015/12/20 07:13:07] <Karkus> leyyin: We are a mario copy
[2015/12/20 07:13:16] <Tobbi> leyyin: I have been thinking about sound blocks..where you need to complete a melody...
[2015/12/20 07:13:16] <mt> leyyin: look at NEWS.md
[2015/12/20 07:13:18] <Tobbi> or something else.
[2015/12/20 07:13:35] <mt> the changelog is already there
[2015/12/20 07:14:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: After 0.4.0 we can make the scripting amazing and well documented.
[2015/12/20 07:14:21] <leyyin> "updated build system, featuring unit tests, libraries as git submodules and improved Travis-CI builds to support nightly builds"
[2015/12/20 07:14:23] <Tobbi> Hopefully.
[2015/12/20 07:14:27] <leyyin> how is that relevant
[2015/12/20 07:14:27] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/20 07:14:28] <leyyin> ?
[2015/12/20 07:14:57] <mt> unit tests might be interesting for packagers
[2015/12/20 07:15:16] <mt> nightly builds might be interesting for users interested in development progress
[2015/12/20 07:15:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am really at a point where this is all getting over my head...
[2015/12/20 07:15:29] <Tobbi> I don't know why...
[2015/12/20 07:15:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: You have to wait 1 day
[2015/12/20 07:16:06] <Tobbi> Maybe it'll be all over tomorrow.
[2015/12/20 07:16:07] <Tobbi> Who knows.
[2015/12/20 07:16:08] <leyyin> yes mt but how is that affecting a new release
[2015/12/20 07:16:22] <leyyin> you have nightly builds, has nothing to do with 0.4 release
[2015/12/20 07:16:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: leyyin can be project lead then.
[2015/12/20 07:16:27] <Karkus> :D
[2015/12/20 07:16:30] * leyyin runs
[2015/12/20 07:16:46] <Karkus> leyyin: It doesn't hurt that much
[2015/12/20 07:16:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: oh no... SuperTux will long for the days he steps down.
[2015/12/20 07:16:53] <Tobbi> Karkus: You cannot tell :D
[2015/12/20 07:17:07] <Tobbi> My whole body is aching.
[2015/12/20 07:17:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: I can assure you leyyin would not be project lead
[2015/12/20 07:17:38] <leyyin> I am not only a dictator
[2015/12/20 07:17:41] <Tobbi> Whenever someone on Transifex emails me (especially today) I feel like I'm surrounded by fire.
[2015/12/20 07:17:42] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 07:17:42] <Karkus> He doesn't even like SuperTux that much do you, leyyin?
[2015/12/20 07:17:54] <leyyin> I like it, not love it
[2015/12/20 07:18:16] <Tobbi> It's hard to love something like SuperTux when you have OCD.
[2015/12/20 07:18:17] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 07:19:39] <leyyin> Karkus, cute project
[2015/12/20 07:19:55] <leyyin> Karkus, should be project lead, young, fresh meat, quit good ;)
[2015/12/20 07:20:45] <Karkus> leyyin: Young, as in, I don't understand how any of this stuff works
[2015/12/20 07:20:55] @ Quit: alket: Ping timeout: 260 seconds
[2015/12/20 07:20:56] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/12/20 07:20:56] <Karkus> What is SuperTux again?
[2015/12/20 07:21:11] <Tobbi> Karkus: Only I have the right to say that :D
[2015/12/20 07:21:25] <Tobbi> I don't know anything about SuperTux :D
[2015/12/20 07:21:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: Maybe, but you know a lot more than me about developing SuperTux :P
[2015/12/20 07:22:00] <Tobbi> Karkus: Only when I am not in denial.
[2015/12/20 07:22:10] <Tobbi> Which I currently am. Call it a pressure battling tactic.
[2015/12/20 07:22:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is maths22 going to be building for us then?
[2015/12/20 07:22:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: iirc, it builds automatically, doesn't it?
[2015/12/20 07:22:47] <Tobbi> I still hope he shows up, though.
[2015/12/20 07:22:59] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's what I mean
[2015/12/20 07:23:08] <mt> It does but then the version number includes the git tags etc
[2015/12/20 07:23:12] <mt> but
[2015/12/20 07:23:29] <mt> you can build from the source tarball with a modified version.cmake
[2015/12/20 07:23:51] <Tobbi> I could, yes.
[2015/12/20 07:23:51] <mt> that allows you to set "v0.4.0" as only version string
[2015/12/20 07:25:26] @ Quit: brmbrmcar: Ping timeout: 260 seconds
[2015/12/20 07:25:26] <mt> we can also just build the tarball (I can do that) and wait until maths22 shows up for building OS X and Windows binaries
[2015/12/20 07:25:42] <Tobbi> Yeah, might work.
[2015/12/20 07:25:59] <mt> however, I probably need some patches for homebrew
[2015/12/20 07:26:11] <mt> Since simply building an .app bundle is broken right now
[2015/12/20 07:27:24] <mt> for some reason I'd like these patches to be committed before tagging v0.4.0
[2015/12/20 07:29:24] <Tobbi> mt: Go right ahead and submit them.
[2015/12/20 07:29:44] <mt> I don't have these patches
[2015/12/20 07:30:08] <Tobbi> mt: What is broken about building an app?
[2015/12/20 07:30:39] <mt> well, make install just puts an "MacOS" directory in the prefix directory
[2015/12/20 07:30:53] <mt> and the standard subdirs (games, share, ...)
[2015/12/20 07:31:03] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/12/20 07:31:06] <Tobbi> I will try it out.
[2015/12/20 07:32:49] <mt> maths22 made it use cpack
[2015/12/20 07:34:29] <leyyin> supertux does not work properly on the OS of the lead developer :P
[2015/12/20 07:34:43] <Tobbi> ffs, leyyin
[2015/12/20 07:35:03] <leyyin> what? :D
[2015/12/20 07:35:10] <Tobbi> leyyin: Stop, just...stop.
[2015/12/20 07:35:18] <Tobbi> Meine Nerven liegen blank.
[2015/12/20 07:35:38] <Tobbi> Ah, My nerves are raw.
[2015/12/20 07:35:44] <leyyin> I hit the right buttons then ;)
[2015/12/20 07:37:00] <Tobbi> leyyin: It's not hard to provoke me, really.
[2015/12/20 07:37:02] <Tobbi> People do it all the time.
[2015/12/20 07:37:06] <Tobbi> And I can't distance it.
[2015/12/20 07:37:10] <Tobbi> eeh keep distance from it.
[2015/12/20 07:39:45] <leyyin> come on Tobbi, it's funny :)
[2015/12/20 07:39:58] <Tobbi> leyyin: Not on release day.
[2015/12/20 07:40:28] <leyyin> well you can always postpone it or make 0.4a
[2015/12/20 07:41:28] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, package managers don't like .a
[2015/12/20 07:41:37] <leyyin> poor package managers
[2015/12/20 07:41:46] <leyyin> I do not get why you care about them
[2015/12/20 07:43:02] <leyyin> WOOOHOOO, 0.4 release today
[2015/12/20 07:43:08] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/20 07:43:09] <leyyin> THE HYPE IS REAL
[2015/12/20 07:43:13] <Tobbi> leyyin: Because we got yelled at before.
[2015/12/20 07:43:16] <Tobbi> leyyin: Stop it.
[2015/12/20 07:43:21] <Tobbi> You're making me more nervous.
[2015/12/20 07:43:27] <Tobbi> I'm under pressure fixing this install command.

[2015/12/20 07:44:48] <leyyin> then 0.4.1
[2015/12/20 07:44:48] <Tobbi> mt: Do we bundle libpng, libjpeg and libz?
[2015/12/20 07:44:48] <mt> I guess for the official build yes
[2015/12/20 07:44:48] <mt> but for homebrew not
[2015/12/20 07:44:59] <Tobbi> mt: That's the problem: MacOS doesn't seem writable.
[2015/12/20 07:45:04] <Tobbi> Or rather...
[2015/12/20 07:45:30] <mt> I think I've found a solution
[2015/12/20 07:45:51] <Tobbi> Go right ahead and commit it.
[2015/12/20 07:46:09] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, we've decided to follow Firefox's versioning system.
[2015/12/20 07:46:18] <Tobbi> After SuperTux 0.4, it's SuperTux 1.0
[2015/12/20 07:46:21] <Tobbi> And then SuperTUx 2.
[2015/12/20 07:46:23] <Tobbi> And then...
[2015/12/20 07:46:25] <Tobbi> well you get the idea.
[2015/12/20 07:46:33] <leyyin> I do not agree but do as you wish
[2015/12/20 07:46:37] <mt> Nope I'll test before committing
[2015/12/20 07:46:37] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 07:46:45] <Tobbi> leyyin: I am kidding, obviously.
[2015/12/20 07:47:07] <Karkus> haha
[2015/12/20 07:47:19] <leyyin> tbh, I am always hyped about new open source software release
[2015/12/20 07:47:26] <leyyin> I am weird like that
[2015/12/20 07:47:55] <Tobbi> leyyin: New SuperTux release every 6 weeks :D
[2015/12/20 07:48:07] <Karkus> leyyin: http://lists.lethargik.org/pipermail/supertux-devel-lethargik.org/2014-April/003761.html
[2015/12/20 07:48:07] <leyyin> stable release?
[2015/12/20 07:48:08] <brmbrmcar> Nice!
[2015/12/20 07:48:21] <Tobbi> I assume package managers will come over to my house and assassinate me.
[2015/12/20 07:48:23] <Karkus> I bet this guy plays SuperTUX
[2015/12/20 07:48:25] <Tobbi> If we did that.
[2015/12/20 07:48:49] <leyyin> Tobbi, f*** package mangers
[2015/12/20 07:49:08] <Tobbi> leyyin: I am someone who can only thrive in a harmonic virtual environment.
[2015/12/20 07:49:18] <leyyin> you won't develop new stuff and release it because of some package mangers
[2015/12/20 07:49:22] <Tobbi> So, in an ideal world, we would not have any brmbrmcar and stuff like that.
[2015/12/20 07:49:25] <leyyin> that is plain stupid
[2015/12/20 07:49:35] <Tobbi> My middle name is plain stupid.
[2015/12/20 07:50:20] <Tobbi> Tobias "plain stupid" Markus.
[2015/12/20 07:50:22] <Tobbi> Sounds about right.
[2015/12/20 07:52:52] <mt> >_>
[2015/12/20 07:53:00] <mt> homebrew doesn't build with -j $(nproc)
[2015/12/20 07:53:07] <mt> slooooww
[2015/12/20 07:53:53] <leyyin> hmm Karkus, nice email, implement that and supertux would be much addicting :D
[2015/12/20 07:54:10] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 260 seconds
[2015/12/20 07:56:18] <Tobbi> mt: By the way: Should we use "du" or "sie" in the game?
[2015/12/20 07:56:30] <Tobbi> Wuzzy changed everything to "Sie".
[2015/12/20 07:56:38] <Tobbi> I personally would prefer "du".
[2015/12/20 07:56:41] <Tobbi> but, hey...
[2015/12/20 07:57:03] <mt> Wikipedia has German (Du) and German (Sie) oslt
[2015/12/20 07:58:18] <leyyin> du hast
[2015/12/20 07:59:19] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/12/20 07:59:37] <Tobbi> Having two different languages would be weird...
[2015/12/20 07:59:47] <Tobbi> but hey...SuperTux 0.5
[2015/12/20 07:59:48] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/20 07:59:58] <Tobbi> mt: Does the fix work?
[2015/12/20 08:00:04] <Tobbi> re. cpack etc.
[2015/12/20 08:00:09] <mt> no, have to fix something else
[2015/12/20 08:00:52] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/12/20 08:01:56] <lumidify> Since it's a game, I think "du" is appropriate.
[2015/12/20 08:02:48] <mt> +1 for du in games
[2015/12/20 08:02:57] <mt> but we can fix that after release
[2015/12/20 08:03:09] <mt> thanks to downloadable language packs :)
[2015/12/20 08:04:09] <Tobbi> mt: Yes. It should prefer language pack source strings I believe. I hope...
[2015/12/20 08:04:34] <mt> sloooow homebrew build again
[2015/12/20 08:06:47] <mt> brew reinstall supertux && pray
[2015/12/20 08:06:57] <mt> && supertux2
[2015/12/20 08:07:15] <Tobbi> 2 hours to go.
[2015/12/20 08:07:21] <Tobbi> gosh.
[2015/12/20 08:08:13] <head8debian> :D
[2015/12/20 08:09:12] <Tobbi> Hello head8debian

[2015/12/20 08:09:17] <Tobbi> We've missed you.
[2015/12/20 08:09:24] <mt> broken build system for OS X
[2015/12/20 08:09:26] <mt> :(
[2015/12/20 08:10:22] <Tobbi> mt: Can you fix it? Can maths22?
[2015/12/20 08:10:31] <mt> I'm trying to
[2015/12/20 08:13:42] <mt> let's hope it's fixed now
[2015/12/20 08:17:43] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/20 08:28:07] <mt> I think it should work now
[2015/12/20 08:28:13] <mt> let me test it one last time

[2015/12/20 08:43:18] <Tobbi> mt: Commit, please.
[2015/12/20 08:43:23] <mt> So I hope I don't break any of the other build system parts

[2015/12/20 08:58:00] <Tobbi> mt: Sure, one moment.
[2015/12/20 08:59:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: Missed me?
[2015/12/20 08:59:22] <Tobbi> head8debian: yup. Getting ready to party? :P
[2015/12/20 08:59:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, what do i need to do? Im open ATM.
[2015/12/20 08:59:24] <Tobbi> one hour left.
[2015/12/20 08:59:33] <Tobbi> mt: Do you have anything for him to do?
[2015/12/20 08:59:43] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/12/20 08:59:46] <mt> I don't think so
[2015/12/20 09:00:05] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2015/12/20 09:00:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: I'd say we're good to go.
[2015/12/20 09:00:42] <mt> yep we seem to be ready
[2015/12/20 09:00:52] <mt> after all the last-minute-changes
[2015/12/20 09:01:40] <head8debian> :D
[2015/12/20 09:02:08] <Tobbi> Except...the dmg doesn't open.
[2015/12/20 09:02:10] <Tobbi> Let me find the log.
[2015/12/20 09:02:20] <Not-e81f> [02supertux] 03Success. AppVeyor build succeeded - 13https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maths22/supertux-9ml4d/build/151
[2015/12/20 09:02:37] <mt> Tobbi: does the previous dmg work?
[2015/12/20 09:02:41] <Tobbi> I'll try.
[2015/12/20 09:02:46] <mt> if it doesn't -> not my fault
[2015/12/20 09:03:36] <head8debian> Im making sure it builds ATM...
[2015/12/20 09:03:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: Website need to be updated?
[2015/12/20 09:04:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh, yes.
[2015/12/20 09:04:13] <head8debian> I can do that, if i remember how... :D
[2015/12/20 09:04:35] <Tobbi> Man, what's wrong now?
[2015/12/20 09:04:42] <Tobbi> Sometimes I hate my mac.
[2015/12/20 09:05:26] <mt> It does work on my Mac
[2015/12/20 09:05:29] <head8debian> She works! :D
[2015/12/20 09:05:42] <mt> both the latest (622) and the previous (611) build
[2015/12/20 09:05:50] <Tobbi> One moment.
[2015/12/20 09:05:59] <Tobbi> everything is slow now.
[2015/12/20 09:05:59] <mt> you need to Agree to the license
[2015/12/20 09:06:04] <head8debian> Ok, how long does it take for htdocs to update  the main website?
[2015/12/20 09:06:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: What have you done by now? It should write to a submodule that you need to push as well.
[2015/12/20 09:07:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: Nothing.
[2015/12/20 09:07:11] <mt> head8debian: you update htdocs, generate the website, push that to SuperTux.github.io
[2015/12/20 09:07:13] <Tobbi> ok.
[2015/12/20 09:07:18] <mt> and then it'll appear
[2015/12/20 09:07:33] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, the generated/ directory is a submodule.
[2015/12/20 09:07:40] <Tobbi> So you commit the submodule contents, and push them.
[2015/12/20 09:07:50] <mt> btw, should I change the URL in the homebrew formula to supertuxproject.org?
[2015/12/20 09:07:51] <head8debian> And how is it generated?
[2015/12/20 09:08:01] <mt> use `make`
[2015/12/20 09:08:06] <head8debian> I think ive done this before, but i cannot remember.
[2015/12/20 09:08:41] <Tobbi> okay, should be better now.
[2015/12/20 09:08:43] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2015/12/20 09:09:26] <head8debian> Ah, i see now.
[2015/12/20 09:11:23] <Tobbi> mt: It works, the license window is just not in the front.
[2015/12/20 09:11:31] <Tobbi> So, that's why I didn't se eit.
[2015/12/20 09:11:34] <Tobbi> *see it
[2015/12/20 09:12:25] <mt> so, everything ok for the release!
[2015/12/20 09:12:52] <Tobbi> Looks like it.
[2015/12/20 09:13:21] <mt> also:
[2015/12/20 09:13:24] <Tobbi> mt: Actually, could you get the background image to work?
[2015/12/20 09:13:31] <mt> my highlight monitor usually: full of irc spam
[2015/12/20 09:13:49] <mt> my highlight monitor now: almost everything in #supertux, most highlights by Tobbi
[2015/12/20 09:13:55] <Tobbi> mt: I am sorry.
[2015/12/20 09:14:05] <mt> not something to be sorry about :P
[2015/12/20 09:14:15] <Tobbi> Actually, I meant: mt: I am sorry, mt. It won't happen again, mt.
[2015/12/20 09:14:48] <mt> nah, I don't really understand CPack or how backgrounds/licenses work in DMGs
[2015/12/20 09:14:59] <Tobbi> Hmm, okay.
[2015/12/20 09:15:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: ...
[2015/12/20 09:15:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: 45 minutes.
[2015/12/20 09:15:42] <mt> I think we can already start the magic release dance in 30 minutes ;)
[2015/12/20 09:16:23] <head8debian> :D:D:D:D
[2015/12/20 09:16:38] * head8debian ques the music... :D
[2015/12/20 09:16:46] <Tobbi> mt: You will do the tagging and branching stuff, right?
[2015/12/20 09:16:58] <Tobbi> If I recall correctly, I tagged a bugfix :D
[2015/12/20 09:17:07] <Tobbi> Or should I say: I retagged a bugfix for 0.3.5
[2015/12/20 09:17:23] <mt> if you want me to, I will
[2015/12/20 09:17:28] <Tobbi> mt: Yes, please.
[2015/12/20 09:17:32] @ swift110-phone joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/20 09:17:34] <swift110-phone> Hey
[2015/12/20 09:17:38] <mt> Hi swift110-phone
[2015/12/20 09:17:50] <mt> The magic release dance will start soon :P
[2015/12/20 09:18:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, do we have new download links yet?
[2015/12/20 09:18:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: Things are not yet built.
[2015/12/20 09:18:16] <Tobbi> How can there be download links?
[2015/12/20 09:21:13] <mt> 15:14:28 <@Tobbi> Or should I say: I retagged a bugfix for 0.3.5 <-- you can remove the tag and retag the old tag hash
[2015/12/20 09:21:24] <Tobbi> mt: That's what I did.
[2015/12/20 09:21:47] <swift110-phone> How r u mt
[2015/12/20 09:21:48] <mt> oh I thought you mistakenly tagged  that bugfix after the release
[2015/12/20 09:22:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/12/20 09:22:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Just wondering if they are built yet.
[2015/12/20 09:22:59] <mt> swift110-phone: I'm fine
[2015/12/20 09:23:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: We had last minute fixes in the build system.
[2015/12/20 09:23:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ah, ok.
[2015/12/20 09:23:24] <Tobbi> 40 minutes...anyone wanna prepare confetti? :P
[2015/12/20 09:23:25] <mt> also, we need to wait for the tag to build
[2015/12/20 09:24:19] <Tobbi> mt: In the release announcement: Stable release -> bold!
[2015/12/20 09:24:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: NO!@!!!!! I had to clean up a ton of that junk last night for our christmas program.
[2015/12/20 09:24:54] <Tobbi> :D Okay...
[2015/12/20 09:25:08] <mt> Tobbi: done
[2015/12/20 09:25:13] <Tobbi> Thanks.
[2015/12/20 09:25:15] <Tobbi> alright...
[2015/12/20 09:25:30] <Tobbi> mt: How long does it take to build? 20 minutes?
[2015/12/20 09:25:34] <mt> also, should I change ten and a half years to more than a decade?
[2015/12/20 09:25:41] <Tobbi> mt: Sure.
[2015/12/20 09:25:57] <Tobbi> If the build takes roughly 20 minutes, we can trigger a build in 15 minutes.
[2015/12/20 09:26:13] <swift110-phone> Good mt
[2015/12/20 09:26:22] <swift110-phone> What ya up to mt
[2015/12/20 09:26:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: This is the second supertux stable release, correct?
[2015/12/20 09:26:33] <Tobbi> head8debian: yes.
[2015/12/20 09:26:44] <mt> I won't update the gist again, just the draft https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/releases/tag/untagged-6a993bba4aabd905fb29
[2015/12/20 09:26:50] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2015/12/20 09:27:11] <mt> swift110-phone: well, we're all preparing for the release
[2015/12/20 09:27:22] <mt> -for
[2015/12/20 09:27:45] <mt> Tobbi: I don't know how long, I'd also prefer to build it from the source tarball
[2015/12/20 09:28:03] <mt> since then we'll be able to change the PACKAGE_VERSION by hand
[2015/12/20 09:28:07] <swift110-phone> That's awesome
[2015/12/20 09:28:10] <mt> and set it to v0.4.0
[2015/12/20 09:28:13] <mt> without git junk
[2015/12/20 09:28:23] <swift110-phone> I shall download it today if possible
[2015/12/20 09:28:38] <mt> I'll upload a tarball as soon as everything's tagged
[2015/12/20 09:28:56] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/12/20 09:29:00] <head8debian> mt: Ok, and im sitting here waiting to update the download links. :)
[2015/12/20 09:29:05] <mt> for the official builds we just need win32, osx and possibly win64
[2015/12/20 09:29:05] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 09:29:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: And the release announcement.
[2015/12/20 09:29:27] <mt> for the release announcement, just take the one from github
[2015/12/20 09:29:35] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/releases/tag/untagged-6a993bba4aabd905fb29

[2015/12/20 09:30:23] <mt> for the non-tarball builds let's just wait for maths22
[2015/12/20 09:30:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yep.
[2015/12/20 09:30:29] <mt> we can add them after release
[2015/12/20 09:30:41] <head8debian> Oh.
[2015/12/20 09:30:42] <Tobbi> yes
[2015/12/20 09:32:05] <head8debian> I made my own release announcement, oh well, it can be thrown out.
[2015/12/20 09:32:43] <Tobbi> head8debian: What have you got?
[2015/12/20 09:32:45] <Tobbi> pastebin.
[2015/12/20 09:32:52] <Tobbi> You may want to merge them.
[2015/12/20 09:35:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: mt's is much better. :)
[2015/12/20 09:35:43] <Tobbi> Okay.

[2015/12/20 09:37:10] <mt> head8debian: you need to use `make`
[2015/12/20 09:37:12] <mt> just `make`
[2015/12/20 09:37:20] <mt> you also need xsltproc installed
[2015/12/20 09:37:35] <mt> check that the build submodule is activated
[2015/12/20 09:38:52] <head8debian> mt: I know.
[2015/12/20 09:39:04] <head8debian> mt: Bu this xml is somewhat diferent than normal html.
[2015/12/20 09:39:13] <mt> I already posted this: "btw, should I change the URL in the homebrew formula to supertuxproject.org?"
[2015/12/20 09:39:27] <mt> head8debian: what's your problem?

[2015/12/20 09:41:53] <head8debian> hmm...
[2015/12/20 09:41:55] <mt> yeah, I understood
[2015/12/20 09:42:33] <Tobbi> mt: So, the tag will be "v0.4", is that correct?
[2015/12/20 09:42:47] <mt> v0.4.0
[2015/12/20 09:42:57] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2015/12/20 09:43:05] <Tobbi> I thought you mentioned something about 0.4 yesterday.
[2015/12/20 09:43:06] <Tobbi> But nvm
[2015/12/20 09:43:12] <mt> right now it's also SemVer 2.0.0 not SemVer 2
[2015/12/20 09:43:14] <mt> http://semver.org/
[2015/12/20 09:43:30] <mt> however, the *branch* will be release/0.4
[2015/12/20 09:43:50] <mt> since it will contain the entire 0.4.z release series
[2015/12/20 09:44:24] <Tobbi> ok.
[2015/12/20 09:44:53] * head8debian headbangs...
[2015/12/20 09:45:58] <mt> Tobbi: tell giby_the_kid to add some more people as ops; I tried multiple times but nothing happened
[2015/12/20 09:46:12] <Tobbi> mt: Yeah, possibly.
[2015/12/20 09:46:50] <giby_the_kid> Hi
[2015/12/20 09:48:38] <Tobbi> mt: Okay, can you tag and trigger a build?
[2015/12/20 09:48:42] <Tobbi> I think it's time.
[2015/12/20 09:50:59] <mt> ok then
[2015/12/20 09:52:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes, you need to talk to giby about ops...
[2015/12/20 09:52:51] <brmbrmcar> 10minutesuntil release now?
[2015/12/20 09:52:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why me? He's in the room.
[2015/12/20 09:53:34] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: Can you please give some more people ops...?
[2015/12/20 09:53:38] <Tobbi> Otherwise they keep bugging me.

[2015/12/20 10:56:41] <bitlord> I didn't play this in a long time, but it was one of the first games I played when I got my gnu/linux setup in ~2005, so I don't remember much about it and is all of those features new, I guess some of them are to me, maybe not part of 0.4 release ;-)
[2015/12/20 10:57:19] <mt> there's a changelog you can read if you want to know what changed

[2015/12/20 10:57:29] <bitlord> about +o/+O  one is autoop, other is for user to be able to manually op ;-)
[2015/12/20 10:57:30] <Tobbi> Instead of only lowercase +f?
[2015/12/20 10:57:37] <Tobbi> I see..
[2015/12/20 10:57:38] <mt> so basically +*
[2015/12/20 10:57:39] <Tobbi> I can|t set either.
[2015/12/20 10:57:42] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/12/20 10:58:51] <bitlord> mt, thanks, but no, I'm too busy playing the game right now! :) (it is awesome, I love these "simple" games, games which you play to have fun)

[2015/12/20 11:00:05] <bitlord> is there a "limit" temporary for "jump+down"? you do it few times and then it doesn't work? (or there is something messy with the input?)

[2015/12/20 11:47:25] <Karkus> Shall I edit the release instead to detail which download is for which OS?
[2015/12/20 11:47:33] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yeah, that will work.
[2015/12/20 11:47:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: Also, say that if they are in need for some christmas mood, they should enable Christmas mode in the settings.
[2015/12/20 11:48:04] <Tobbi> It should be there then.
[2015/12/20 11:48:06] <Karkus> Actually you can't...
[2015/12/20 11:48:16] <Tobbi> You can't edit that either?
[2015/12/20 11:48:33] <Karkus> Yes, but not the downloads. Try it yourself, you'll see
[2015/12/20 11:49:16] <Tobbi> Karkus: edit what about the downloads? The file name?
[2015/12/20 11:50:04] <Karkus> Idk? Is it obvious to a Mac user that ...Darwin.dmg is what they need?
[2015/12/20 11:50:16] <bitlord> and looks like xscreensaver doesn't detect gamepad as input (lol)
[2015/12/20 11:50:17] <Tobbi> Looks like this for me: Karkus: http://screencast.com/t/Qq3VSViMWd2
[2015/12/20 11:50:48] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yup
[2015/12/20 11:50:59] <Karkus> You can't say which is which
[2015/12/20 11:51:27] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2015/12/20 11:51:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: But you can change the name, right?

[2015/12/20 11:52:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: Hmm, I'll try.
[2015/12/20 11:52:39] <Tobbi> SuperTux-0.4.0-Darwin.dmg

[2015/12/20 11:52:42] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/20 11:53:21] <Tobbi> Karkus: Works fine for me.
[2015/12/20 11:53:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: I have to force push to supertux.github.io? o_O
[2015/12/20 11:53:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: Just edit the name and it'll rename the stuff.
[2015/12/20 11:53:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: why? Can't you rebase?
[2015/12/20 11:53:40] <Karkus> head8debian: No
[2015/12/20 11:54:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, im up to date, then i copy the new file over...
[2015/12/20 11:54:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: So, Supertux-0.4.0-MacOS.dmg
[2015/12/20 11:54:16] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yeah, or something to that effect.

[2015/12/20 11:54:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: You don't need to copy. It generates the stuff in a submodule, doesn't it?
[2015/12/20 11:54:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: cd build/ && git fetch origin && git rebase origin/master
[2015/12/20 11:54:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: I copy the download.html that it generated?
[2015/12/20 11:55:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: Where is it generated? What directory?
[2015/12/20 11:55:19] <head8debian> htdocs/build.
[2015/12/20 11:55:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, that is a submodule. Isn't it?
[2015/12/20 11:55:32] <head8debian> I think so.
[2015/12/20 11:55:35] <Tobbi> When you cd into that directory and run git log, what does it say?
[2015/12/20 11:56:20] <Tobbi> or actually git remote -v
[2015/12/20 11:56:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: How about you do it. Ive updated htdocs. :D
[2015/12/20 11:56:26] <Tobbi> okay.
[2015/12/20 11:58:17] <bitlord> so you bundle squirrel in your release?
[2015/12/20 11:58:32] <bitlord> is it possible to use system version maybe?
[2015/12/20 11:59:25] <head8debian> bitlord: IIRC that causes compatability issues.
[2015/12/20 11:59:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: At some point, did you force-push?

[2015/12/20 12:07:22] <Tobbi> Done.
[2015/12/20 12:07:26] <Tobbi> better not touch this.
[2015/12/20 12:15:32] <bitlord> does the source come with a icon so I can create a link on my desktop? :D
[2015/12/20 12:16:15] <Tobbi> bitlord: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/tree/master/data/images/engine/icons
[2015/12/20 12:17:10] <bitlord> thank you!
[2015/12/20 12:17:22] <Tobbi> bitlord: So, it should be in the data/ directory.
[2015/12/20 12:18:15] <bitlord> yes it is there, I just didn't try to look very hard (/me lazy!)
[2015/12/20 12:23:11] <Tobbi> bbl...
[2015/12/20 12:25:13] <tomreyn> do you know the status of supertux.com? it's registered to zack damen
[2015/12/20 12:26:47] <brmbrmcar> We did.
[2015/12/20 12:27:06] <brmbrmcar> Well, supertux.org.
[2015/12/20 12:27:38] <brmbrmcar> .com wouldm#t be used anyway.
[2015/12/20 12:32:23] <tomreyn> well you could redirect com to the new domain name
[2015/12/20 12:32:34] <tomreyn> it looks like .org got grabbed by commercial grabbers
[2015/12/20 12:33:04] <tomreyn> they want like 250 + fees for it
[2015/12/20 12:33:17] <tomreyn> but maybe .com could be free
[2015/12/20 12:33:24] @ Quit: Tobbi: Remote host closed the connection

[2015/12/20 12:35:20] <brmbrmcar> I'll check supertux.com myself now.
[2015/12/20 12:35:39] <Karkus> tomreyn: To be quite honest, we're okay with supertuxproject.org
[2015/12/20 12:35:58] <tomreyn> ok, i was just wondering
[2015/12/20 12:36:18] <brmbrmcar> I can't even connect to supertux.com.
[2015/12/20 12:37:33] <tomreyn> it doesn't have an A record
[2015/12/20 12:37:36] <tomreyn> just MX
[2015/12/20 12:37:47] <tomreyn> so chances are he uses or used it for mail only
[2015/12/20 12:38:38] <brmbrmcar> Ah.

[2015/12/20 13:06:43] <bitlord> ok, looks like release build + custom cxxflags is much smaller ~3.6MB (default build ~10MB)

[2015/12/20 13:12:12] <mt> bitlord: that's because it doesn't contain debug symbols
[2015/12/20 13:13:02] <bitlord> yes, but even with debug stuff, it works fine ;-)

[2015/12/20 13:15:59] <Karkus> mt: Why?
[2015/12/20 13:16:18] <bitlord> Tobbi, yes I did, not sure what to expect, home screen background, hat, anything else?
[2015/12/20 13:16:29] <mt> because you're contributing quite a bit (also flexlay)
[2015/12/20 13:16:49] <Karkus> mt: So not for any purpose, just principle then?
[2015/12/20 13:17:02] <mt> well you can't do anything with voice

[2015/12/20 15:20:03] <leyyin> french is more popular than german and more easy for me
[2015/12/20 15:20:09] <leyyin> and sounds nicer

[2015/12/20 15:29:23] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi:No videos!
[2015/12/20 15:29:31] <leyyin> Tobbi, do you speak danish?
[2015/12/20 15:29:51] <Tobbi> leyyin: Not really...Always wanted to learn it, though.
[2015/12/20 15:30:01] <Tobbi> But the Danish population speaks English...
[2015/12/20 15:30:04] <Tobbi> So, there's really no need.
[2015/12/20 15:30:07] <leyyin> hahaha
[2015/12/20 15:33:41] <brmbrmcar> I want to learnEnglish.
[2015/12/20 15:34:14] <Hume2> Can't you already?
[2015/12/20 15:35:02] <brmbrmcar> Oh, yeah,I forgot...
[2015/12/20 15:39:06] <giby_the_kid> Tobbi, actually, the glass bottom is for another purpose
[2015/12/20 15:39:27] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: When you take jokes seriously, it's not fun.
[2015/12/20 15:39:57] <giby_the_kid> No, this glass bottom is just to facilitate our kamikaze boat
[2015/12/20 15:43:52] <Hume2> When I was in Italy, I saw a street with three signs "do not enter" and a man going right there.
[2015/12/20 15:43:56] <brmbrmcar> Where is the *** *** tank, then?
[2015/12/20 15:44:56] <Hume2> Are thoe *** *** white or red?
[2015/12/20 15:45:05] <Hume2> s/thoe/those
[2015/12/20 15:45:28] * Hume2 forgot a slash.
[2015/12/20 15:46:08] <brmbrmcar> Any colour.
[2015/12/20 15:46:17] <brmbrmcar> brm brm tank...
[2015/12/20 15:46:30] <Hume2> That makes sense.
[2015/12/20 15:47:16] <brmbrmcar> Ah,Ijust wanted to crashit.That's all.
[2015/12/20 15:47:54] <Hume2> What are you going to crash into?
[2015/12/20 15:48:13] <brmbrmcar> Er... a *** *** car.
[2015/12/20 15:48:13] <Hume2> Any target or something specific?
[2015/12/20 15:49:17] <Tobbi> Guys, can't you keep it down. It's release day...
[2015/12/20 15:49:31] <brmbrmcar> Head on, 100kmh for the *** *** car and max speed for the tank, by wall.
[2015/12/20 15:49:49] <brmbrmcar> I like the destruction!
[2015/12/20 15:50:03] <Hume2> Show me the tank that can ride so fast...
[2015/12/20 15:50:36] <Hume2> Maybe "die Fensterpolitik" is more effective.
[2015/12/20 15:51:00] <brmbrmcar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gz9u-yw8Zw
[2015/12/20 15:51:55] <Tobbi> Die Fensterpolitik?
[2015/12/20 15:52:31] <Hume2> That's a fictional book by JÃ¡ra Cimrman.
[2015/12/20 15:53:02] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/12/20 15:53:11] <Tobbi> It means "The window politics"
[2015/12/20 15:53:18] <brmbrmcar> Who is J?ra Cimrmam?
[2015/12/20 15:53:36] <brmbrmcar> *Cimrman
[2015/12/20 15:54:14] <Tobbi> Some carpenter.
[2015/12/20 15:54:28] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/20 15:54:41] <Hume2> It's a guy who lived in the secound half of 19th century and invented many stuff.
[2015/12/20 15:55:48] <Hume2> And he also wrote some dramas.
[2015/12/20 15:58:16] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/20 15:59:09] <Hume2> For example he invited lighting bulbs.
[2015/12/20 15:59:49] <brmbrmcar> Colour changing ones? :D
[2015/12/20 16:00:08] <Hume2> He called it "jÃ¡rovka" and the French pronounced it like "Å¾Ã¡rovka". That's how it's called in Czech.
[2015/12/20 16:01:37] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/20 16:02:40] <Hume2> It's a linguistic humor, you can't understand that.
[2015/12/20 16:03:13] <brmbrmcar> Yep.
[2015/12/20 16:05:06] <Hume2> The Window Politics is about how to effective throw people trough the window.
[2015/12/20 16:05:22] <brmbrmcar> Really?
[2015/12/20 16:05:53] <Hume2> Yes. I'll try to get out how is "defenestrace" in English.
[2015/12/20 16:06:42] <Hume2> Basically it means "throw someone trough the window".
[2015/12/20 16:06:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: There are three cameras created for each level now.
[2015/12/20 16:06:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh.
[2015/12/20 16:06:59] <Tobbi> (one for each layer?)
[2015/12/20 16:07:06] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah!
[2015/12/20 16:07:16] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2015/12/20 16:08:21] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It's "defenestration".
[2015/12/20 16:08:41] <brmbrmcar> I;m not getting it. :(
[2015/12/20 16:09:13] <Hume2> It's a typical Czech way how to get rid of important men.

[2015/12/20 16:10:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: Stupid Python indentation.
[2015/12/20 16:10:15] <Karkus> I like it though :D
[2015/12/20 16:10:17] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yeah, could've guessed. :D
[2015/12/20 16:11:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's good you noticed, thanks
[2015/12/20 16:11:18] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/12/20 16:11:34] <leyyin> who hates python identation?
[2015/12/20 16:12:19] <Hume2> Me.
[2015/12/20 16:12:41] <Tobbi> No, Karkus does.
[2015/12/20 16:12:42] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/20 16:12:45] <leyyin> tbh, it makes you code nicely
[2015/12/20 16:12:48] <brmbrmcar> red_bot: Have you met brmbrmbot yet? :D
[2015/12/20 16:13:02] <Tobbi> Ich habe da ein ganz mieses GefÃ¼hl.
[2015/12/20 16:13:03] <leyyin> I have seen too many stupid identations, 2 space followed by 8 space
[2015/12/20 16:13:09] <Karkus> leyyin: I said it was stupid, but I love it
[2015/12/20 16:13:11] <leyyin> it forces you = good
[2015/12/20 16:13:23] <Karkus> Yeah, I can't fault it really
[2015/12/20 16:13:37] <leyyin> just try to code in rust
[2015/12/20 16:13:41] <Karkus> leyyin: Do you like dynamic typing
[2015/12/20 16:13:45] <leyyin> you would see how stupid you are
[2015/12/20 16:13:50] <leyyin> rust knows better than you :)
[2015/12/20 16:13:54] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar's sentence => "I've got a very bad feeling about this"
[2015/12/20 16:14:06] <leyyin> Karkus, yes, for scripting ;)
[2015/12/20 16:14:08] <Tobbi> Or whatever that star wars quote is.
[2015/12/20 16:14:15] <leyyin> and small stuff
[2015/12/20 16:14:29] <Karkus> leyyin: Fair enough
[2015/12/20 16:14:37] <Karkus> I like it, sometimes it's great.
[2015/12/20 16:14:42] <Karkus> But other times...
[2015/12/20 16:14:54] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: /whois brmbrmbot
[2015/12/20 16:14:58] <leyyin> yes, but strong typing is more sane :D
[2015/12/20 16:15:02] <brmbrmcar> Real bot!
[2015/12/20 16:15:03] <leyyin> none are perfect
[2015/12/20 16:15:10] <leyyin> there are times when you want to kick both
[2015/12/20 16:16:05] <leyyin> dynamic typed languages tend to be more strong type
[2015/12/20 16:16:15] <leyyin> and strong typed tend to be more dynamic :P

[2015/12/20 16:24:57] <Karkus> leyyin, Tobbi: How bad do you consider an "except:" statement in Python3?
[2015/12/20 16:25:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't know any exceptions.
[2015/12/20 16:25:45] <leyyin> Karkus, why is except: bad?
[2015/12/20 16:25:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: An "except:" statement with no exception given catches everything
[2015/12/20 16:26:00] <Tobbi> I can imagine.
[2015/12/20 16:26:14] <Karkus> leyyin: You might except something you don't want to?
[2015/12/20 16:26:23] <Karkus> debugging could be difficult?
[2015/12/20 16:26:25] <Karkus> Idk
[2015/12/20 16:27:00] <leyyin> Karkus, depends on your usage and what your try to achieve
[2015/12/20 16:27:51] <leyyin> Karkus, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/730764/try-except-in-python-how-do-you-properly-ignore-exceptions
[2015/12/20 16:28:06] <Karkus> leyyin: Okay, when loading a level from lisp file, it's surrounded by try:...except:... because I get various different exceptions
[2015/12/20 16:28:24] <leyyin> are you ignoring the exceptions?
[2015/12/20 16:28:42] <leyyin> why are you doing that?
[2015/12/20 16:28:54] <leyyin> why are you getting the exceptions?
[2015/12/20 16:29:30] <Tobbi> And why is the banana bent?
[2015/12/20 16:29:48] <Tobbi> eeh curved
[2015/12/20 16:30:02] <Karkus> leyyin: IOErrors, no such file. SExprParseErrors, just normal Exceptions. I a Directory something or other error too
[2015/12/20 16:30:19] <Karkus> s/I a/I got a/
[2015/12/20 16:30:19] <red_bot> Karkus meant: "leyyin: IOErrors, no such file. SExprParseErrors, just normal Exceptions. I got a Directory something or other error too"
[2015/12/20 16:30:34] <Karkus> So I decided to except everything
[2015/12/20 16:30:51] <Karkus> leyyin: I intended to remove it - https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/issues/53
[2015/12/20 16:30:55] <leyyin> and if you get an error you tell the user you got an error?
[2015/12/20 16:31:24] <Karkus> leyyin: It's when "recent files" are being loaded.
[2015/12/20 16:31:44] <Karkus> Some might have been deleted, so it just runs through till it find one it can use.
[2015/12/20 16:32:11] <leyyin> I see that you removed forked from :D
[2015/12/20 16:32:24] <Tobbi> leyyin: Github support did.
[2015/12/20 16:32:34] <leyyin> by your request
[2015/12/20 16:32:37] <Karkus> Yeah, I doubt grumbel would want the changes :D
[2015/12/20 16:32:37] <Tobbi> oh, yes.
[2015/12/20 16:33:14] <Karkus> leyyin: Also I deleted 30,000 lines of his code :D
[2015/12/20 16:33:16] <leyyin> Karkus, well what errors are reasonable for recent files?
[2015/12/20 16:33:30] <Karkus> leyyin: Who knows?
[2015/12/20 16:33:38] <leyyin> ignoring errors there seems fine to me
[2015/12/20 16:33:44] <Karkus> leyyin: Realistically, only a few
[2015/12/20 16:33:49] <Karkus> But in theory...
[2015/12/20 16:33:58] <Karkus> leyyin: I guess you're right/

[2015/12/20 16:42:27] <Tobbi> I never did that.
[2015/12/20 16:44:13] <Karkus> 3 stars, I am so proud
[2015/12/20 16:44:29] <Karkus> Okay, 2 stars, I don't count :P

[2015/12/20 16:54:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: You might be a teeny tiny bit biased towards my work :D
[2015/12/20 16:54:22] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 16:58:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: Hmm, not sure.
[2015/12/20 16:59:18] <Karkus> I guess it must then.
[2015/12/20 16:59:40] <Karkus> It would be "/msg @#supertux hello, ops" right?
[2015/12/20 17:03:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: I think so.
[2015/12/20 17:05:23] <Tobbi> Creating a level in flexlay is really tedious.
[2015/12/20 17:05:40] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hmm, I agree
[2015/12/20 17:06:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: I guess it should get better once we have proper presets...
[2015/12/20 17:06:13] <Tobbi> or rather templates etc.
[2015/12/20 17:06:18] <giby_the_kid> Anyone mastering C#?
[2015/12/20 17:06:29] <Tobbi> I am not really good at it.
[2015/12/20 17:06:45] <Karkus> giby_the_kid: Thinking of the mono editor?
[2015/12/20 17:06:59] <giby_the_kid> yes
[2015/12/20 17:07:19] <Karkus> giby_the_kid: I've never touched C#
[2015/12/20 17:07:25] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: I'd really suggest to push forward the python one.
[2015/12/20 17:07:56] <Tobbi> Do you know python?
[2015/12/20 17:07:59] <Tobbi> You could help us.
[2015/12/20 17:08:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: Maybe it should just set some presets and then you can edit music etc. in settings?
[2015/12/20 17:08:54] <Tobbi> Karkus: I was thinking about tile groups...so that you can work with objects...
[2015/12/20 17:08:58] <Tobbi> But we have that...
[2015/12/20 17:09:05] <Tobbi> as an issue, I mean.
[2015/12/20 17:09:29] <Karkus> we do?
[2015/12/20 17:09:43] <Karkus> Oh, yeah
[2015/12/20 17:10:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Shouldn't be too difficult I guess.
[2015/12/20 17:10:26] <Karkus> Tobbi: Except making a gui to create them etc.
[2015/12/20 17:10:32] <Karkus> *sigh*
[2015/12/20 17:10:35] <Tobbi> Oh, yeah...
[2015/12/20 17:12:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'll get round to it eventually :D
[2015/12/20 17:12:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am really thinking of a list view  or a dropdown view to create them.
[2015/12/20 17:12:38] <Tobbi> eeh select them from.
[2015/12/20 17:13:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: But you want to be able to see what you're doing, and create your own...
[2015/12/20 17:13:18] <Tobbi> Yes, I guess so.
[2015/12/20 17:13:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: And then store them somewhere
[2015/12/20 17:13:36] <Tobbi> Yes.

[2015/12/20 17:14:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: For mac users like me, this is extremely tedious.
[2015/12/20 17:14:43] <Tobbi> Also, sometimes the tiles you want connected to each other are not that way.
[2015/12/20 17:14:45] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah :D
[2015/12/20 17:14:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: Of course

[2015/12/20 17:48:23] <tux|dude> Oh my god its released! My inner 7 year old self just shed a tear of joy
[2015/12/20 17:48:48] <Tobbi> tux|dude: :)
[2015/12/20 17:49:04] <Tobbi> tux|dude: Though this is mostly a bug fix release in terms of commits.
[2015/12/20 17:49:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: Alot of new people show up?
[2015/12/20 17:49:31] <Tobbi> head8debian: where?
[2015/12/20 17:49:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: In here?
[2015/12/20 17:49:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: Not really...
[2015/12/20 17:49:54] <Tobbi> But some people were made ops, though.
[2015/12/20 17:50:02] <Tobbi> Although you're not one of them :P
[2015/12/20 17:50:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: I see that...
[2015/12/20 17:50:46] <tux|dude> I'm so proud of you guys even though that sounds odd.
[2015/12/20 17:51:04] <head8debian> Good grief, ive been around for 2 years, and you still don't trust me with OPs...
[2015/12/20 17:51:07] <head8debian> Sad...
[2015/12/20 17:51:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: It is not my decision...
[2015/12/20 17:51:22] <Tobbi> head8debian: I talked with giby_the_kid
[2015/12/20 17:52:26] <Tobbi> And I am talking again...
[2015/12/20 17:52:38] <Tobbi> It is not my fault.
[2015/12/20 17:52:39] <Tobbi> really.
[2015/12/20 17:53:11] <tux|dude> You guys should just be proud that you've done it. After 12 years you've done it! You should be giving yourselves a huge pat on the back
[2015/12/20 17:53:26] <Tobbi> tux|dude: We could have release MS 2 anytime...
[2015/12/20 17:53:34] <giby_the_kid> head8debian, it is not that we don't trust in you
[2015/12/20 17:53:36] <Tobbi> *released
[2015/12/20 17:54:25] <tux|dude> Well I think it was good that you got milestone 2 done and dusted now though. You guys did a good job

[2015/12/20 17:54:39] <Tobbi> tux|dude: I am extremely glad we got it over with.
[2015/12/20 17:55:17] <Tobbi> It feels like letting go...
[2015/12/20 17:55:23] <Tobbi> People can now play it, feel good about it.
[2015/12/20 17:55:30] <head8debian> +oo?
[2015/12/20 17:55:33] <Tobbi> And now we can change the protagonist to a brick.
[2015/12/20 17:55:33] <head8debian> :o
[2015/12/20 17:55:40] <Tobbi> Wait, no, no brick.
[2015/12/20 17:56:03] <Tobbi> A dancing something.
[2015/12/20 17:56:08] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/12/20 17:56:23] <head8debian> tux|dude: Yes, its good to have it off our backs. ;)

[2015/12/20 17:57:29] <red_bot> alket, you don't have 'bans::act::kick' permissions here
[2015/12/20 17:57:48] <head8debian> alket: Only people with red_bot's ops can do that. Currently its only me.
[2015/12/20 17:58:02] <Tobbi> alket: I really wonder whether this is what the original developers intended MS 2 release to be.
[2015/12/20 17:58:10] <Tobbi> On the other hand, this has been in beta for 10 years...
[2015/12/20 17:58:18] <Tobbi> And it was stable most of the time.
[2015/12/20 17:58:21] <alket> Tobbi: idk but its quite playablen ow
[2015/12/20 17:58:23] <alket> *now
[2015/12/20 17:58:32] <alket> the last time i checked, i think 2010 ? it was very bad
[2015/12/20 17:58:41] <alket> 2007, good, 2010 until today, bad
[2015/12/20 17:59:12] <alket> I still wonder what downgrade did it have, sine it used to be awesome, then quite bad
[2015/12/20 18:00:28] <tux|dude> I'm just glad it has been released in a stable form now. You guys did well
[2015/12/20 18:00:30] <Tobbi> alket: But it's good now, and that's all that matters.
[2015/12/20 18:00:42] <alket> yeah
[2015/12/20 18:01:20] <Tobbi> tux|dude: There are some rough spots: When you switch languages, it downloads a language pack (opening the add-on manager)...
[2015/12/20 18:01:28] <Tobbi> Which might be unintuitive to many people.
[2015/12/20 18:01:34] <Tobbi> But that code was added fairly recently.
[2015/12/20 18:01:42] <tux|dude> I see
[2015/12/20 18:01:57] <Tobbi> In fact, 3 days ago.
[2015/12/20 18:01:57] <tux|dude> Oh man I like how the snowballs melt when you hit them with a fire flower
[2015/12/20 18:02:01] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 18:02:12] <Tobbi> All Hume's work.
[2015/12/20 18:02:15] <tux|dude> Nice touch
[2015/12/20 18:02:17] <tux|dude> Really nice touch
[2015/12/20 18:02:49] <alket> I see albanian is there xD
[2015/12/20 18:03:03] <Tobbi> alket: Yes, not fully translated though.
[2015/12/20 18:03:04] <Tobbi> Does it work?
[2015/12/20 18:03:16] <alket> yes
[2015/12/20 18:03:31] <Tobbi> Albanian is at 25%.
[2015/12/20 18:03:39] <Tobbi> alket: Do you speak Albanian?
[2015/12/20 18:03:46] <alket> Tobbi: I am Kosovar Albanian
[2015/12/20 18:03:55] <alket> i see in Credits it says 2004 in wallpaper :p
[2015/12/20 18:03:57] <Tobbi> alket: You can help us with localization!!!
[2015/12/20 18:03:57] <leyyin_>  tobbi starred SuperTux/flexlay

[2015/12/20 18:04:39] <tux|dude> The new music doesn't sit quite as well with me as the old stuff but ho hum
[2015/12/20 18:05:14] <alket> Tobbi: yes sure, maybe next week I will do it
[2015/12/20 18:05:30] <alket> but all albanians speak either english, german or italian
[2015/12/20 18:05:36] <alket> we don't even use OS in albanian
[2015/12/20 18:05:43] <Tobbi> hah, alright.
[2015/12/20 18:05:58] <alket> Tobbi: why is there no pic of you xD
[2015/12/20 18:06:15] <Tobbi> alket: I couldn't think of a good one.
[2015/12/20 18:06:23] <Tobbi> Also, I didn't really want to show my face to the world.
[2015/12/20 18:06:30] <alket> hehe
[2015/12/20 18:06:47] <alket> I see the albanian in credits is mentioned a "Albanese" thats the italian spelling :p
[2015/12/20 18:07:19] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/12/20 18:10:06] <alket> I am thinking of doing a "Lite" version of ST in godot for android
[2015/12/20 18:14:08] <Tobbi> Ah, if you want, sure.
[2015/12/20 18:14:12] <Tobbi> Just keep the credits intact.
[2015/12/20 18:14:32] <leyyin_> alket, nice beard https://github.com/alketii
[2015/12/20 18:14:49] <alket> thanks
[2015/12/20 18:14:58] <alket> Tobbi: yeah ofc
[2015/12/20 18:15:06] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/12/20 18:15:10] <alket> Tobbi: I just wished you used TMX for maps
[2015/12/20 18:15:14] <alket> that would have been much easier
[2015/12/20 18:15:24] <Tobbi> alket: I have considered it.
[2015/12/20 18:15:26] <Tobbi> Honestly.
[2015/12/20 18:15:27] <leyyin_> hmm you are the only member of opendungeons and member of godotengine
[2015/12/20 18:16:12] <alket> leyyin_: also megaglest, kobuge and kaos :p
[2015/12/20 18:16:30] <alket> ah, i am the only member who made his membership public :p
[2015/12/20 18:16:45] <leyyin_> ah, that makes sense
[2015/12/20 18:18:05] <Tobbi> I can understand that it's quite a shame to work for these projects.
[2015/12/20 18:18:13] <Tobbi> not like SuperTux where you get tons of praise.
[2015/12/20 18:18:29] <Tobbi> And people ask you "Wow, you work on SuperTux? You must be like the greatest programmer ever!"
[2015/12/20 18:18:42] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 18:19:38] <Tobbi> Happens to me all the time.
[2015/12/20 18:19:52] <alket> leyyin_: btw thats not me :p in pic
[2015/12/20 18:20:07] <leyyin_> I believe that is you
[2015/12/20 18:20:34] <alket> Tobbi: I never get it also, im just into those projects that I have the most free time and I provide support xD not a real contributions

[2015/12/20 18:23:31] <datahead7777> Does Super Tux Milestone 2 get released today or tomorrow?
[2015/12/20 18:23:39] <Tobbi> datahead7777: It was released today.
[2015/12/20 18:23:42] <alket> it got released
[2015/12/20 18:23:48] <datahead7777> Okay
[2015/12/20 18:23:55] <head8debian> datahead7777: So, its officially out. :)
[2015/12/20 18:24:48] <datahead7777> I see you have already updated the website for the download page.
[2015/12/20 18:24:52] <datahead7777> Congratulations!
[2015/12/20 18:28:02] <Tobbi> datahead7777: It feels so good getting this out after so many years.
[2015/12/20 18:28:11] <Tobbi> Especially because that means we can start fresh.
[2015/12/20 18:28:12] <Tobbi> Or something.
[2015/12/20 18:29:35] <datahead7777> What do you mean by start fresh?
[2015/12/20 18:29:45] <datahead7777> It's definitely good - I think Milestone 1 was in 2006 or before
[2015/12/20 18:30:28] <Tobbi> datahead7777: Start fresh = Relax a little... and think about bigger things.
[2015/12/20 18:30:33] <Tobbi> Without having to worry about users.
[2015/12/20 18:35:52] <datahead7777> Oh, I see
[2015/12/20 18:36:42] <datahead7777> Secret Chronicles has ended up slowing down a lot after our release, though I haven't been working on it myself recently.  I've been focusing on my own game for a bit.
[2015/12/20 18:37:33] <head8debian> datahead7777: This release has been in the back of our minds for years, in other words. At the moment we will probably take a little break, but it allows us to do what we want with the game now. THere are no expectations for the next release.
[2015/12/20 18:38:19] <datahead7777> It might be better to go with smaller stable releases and work iteratively
[2015/12/20 18:38:23] <Tobbi> https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/3xms2k/after_10_years_new_stable_release_for_supertux_040/
[2015/12/20 18:38:33] <datahead7777> Rather than dev snapshots, I mean
[2015/12/20 18:38:58] <datahead7777> You could still occasionally do dev snapshots, though, when you won't to show something unstable off
[2015/12/20 18:39:30] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/12/20 18:39:45] <datahead7777> It's up to you guys - just a suggestionb
[2015/12/20 18:40:01] <datahead7777> Anyways, now I won't have to buy a new game, having just finished another one some weeks back
[2015/12/20 18:40:11] <datahead7777> I can just download Super Tux Milestone 2
[2015/12/20 18:40:21] <datahead7777> I was tight on cash anyways

[2015/12/20 18:41:40] <Tobbi> Okay...

[2015/12/20 18:41:49] <Karkus> red_bot: hello
[2015/12/20 18:41:49] <red_bot> but I already know Karkus
[2015/12/20 18:41:56] <Karkus> red_bot: hi
[2015/12/20 18:41:56] <red_bot> hello, Karkus
[2015/12/20 18:42:11] <Tobbi> red_bot: test
[2015/12/20 18:42:15] <Tobbi> red_bot: hello
[2015/12/20 18:42:15] <red_bot> tobbi: hey there
[2015/12/20 18:42:27] <Tobbi> oh.
[2015/12/20 18:42:33] <Karkus> red_bot: will not work
[2015/12/20 18:42:36] <Tobbi> So that's what it does.
[2015/12/20 18:42:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Any hello message will return another
[2015/12/20 18:42:54] <leyyin_> yeah Karkus, just use Tiled :P http://www.mapeditor.org/, remove your editor :P
[2015/12/20 18:43:08] <Tobbi> leyyin_: We can't use tiled. We need advanced features.
[2015/12/20 18:43:11] <Karkus> leyyin_: ik about this :D
[2015/12/20 18:43:36] <leyyin_> what advanced feature? *playind devil advocate here*
[2015/12/20 18:44:08] <Tobbi> leyyin_: Support for squirrel scripts, lisp, etc.
[2015/12/20 18:44:11] <Karkus> leyyin_: TilED is developed with other purposes. We'd have to do other modifications etc.
[2015/12/20 18:44:26] <Karkus> Remove features while keeping up to date
[2015/12/20 18:44:49] <alket> tiled is pretty advanced for that too
[2015/12/20 18:44:59] <datahead7777> Is Hume still working on the built in level editor?
[2015/12/20 18:45:04] <Karkus> datahead7777: yep
[2015/12/20 18:45:09] <datahead7777> I see
[2015/12/20 18:45:17] <datahead7777> You could still use Tiled separately, though
[2015/12/20 18:45:19] <Tobbi> It won't be merged until 0.5.*
[2015/12/20 18:45:26] <Karkus> datahead7777: But you wouldn't use that for real levels...
[2015/12/20 18:45:50] <leyyin_> is there another editor for supertux?
[2015/12/20 18:45:51] <datahead7777> Is Tiled limited in its scope?
[2015/12/20 18:45:57] <leyyin_> how many editors do you have?
[2015/12/20 18:46:01] <Karkus> datahead7777: It outputs to XML atm.
[2015/12/20 18:46:04] <alket> i have seen .stl, there is nothing special I think
[2015/12/20 18:46:05] <Karkus> leyyin_: 4
[2015/12/20 18:46:12] <datahead7777> Tiled is a general purpose editor that can be used for any game potentially.
[2015/12/20 18:46:19] <Karkus> alket: It's lisp s-expressions, not XML
[2015/12/20 18:46:22] <leyyin_> O_O, and you never thought, oh, maybe we have too many damn editors
[2015/12/20 18:46:24] <Karkus> datahead7777: YEs
[2015/12/20 18:46:39] <alket> Karkus: tiled can export to json , csv etc
[2015/12/20 18:46:44] <Karkus> leyyin_: Flexlay was used for all of milestone 1
[2015/12/20 18:46:49] <alket> I also did an exporter + converter for godot
[2015/12/20 18:47:03] <datahead7777> Karkus, what limitations does Tiled have with respect to Super Tux?
[2015/12/20 18:47:12] <Karkus> If anyone wants to create a supertux plugin, go ahead!
[2015/12/20 18:47:19] <Karkus> I'm not stopping you...
[2015/12/20 18:47:28] <Tobbi> No editor is really user friendly...It's just setting tile after tile.
[2015/12/20 18:47:31] <Tobbi> We need to change that.
[2015/12/20 18:47:36] <Tobbi> it really limits creativity.
[2015/12/20 18:47:55] <alket> Karkus: would be hard, tiles are represented with number, like what tile is 165
[2015/12/20 18:47:59] <alket> its quite tiring work
[2015/12/20 18:48:13] <datahead7777> I would argue that an in game editor is the most versatile, but there's nothing wrong with people messing with Tiled
[2015/12/20 18:48:31] <Karkus> datahead7777: Currently, you can't use tilED
[2015/12/20 18:48:36] <Tobbi> Problem is that our UI framework is virtually no-existent.
[2015/12/20 18:48:45] <Karkus> Tobbi's right
[2015/12/20 18:48:50] <datahead7777> You could introduce a 3rd party GUI framework
[2015/12/20 18:49:14] <datahead7777> The one Secret Chronicles uses is CEGUI, though its Windows support seems to be questionable
[2015/12/20 18:49:17] <Karkus> leyyin_: Why did you start this conversation
[2015/12/20 18:49:29] <leyyin_> idk
[2015/12/20 18:49:39] <leyyin_> sleepy I guess
[2015/12/20 18:49:56] <Tobbi> It's good that we can finally think about that...
[2015/12/20 18:50:00] <Tobbi> I mean: No pressure at all.
[2015/12/20 18:50:09] <datahead7777> It's all up to you guys - just was throwing out ideas.  This can be discussed another time.
[2015/12/20 18:50:17] <Tobbi> Not that I really want to change anything in that aspect, but at least we can think about it.
[2015/12/20 18:50:17] <alket> datahead7777: CEGUI works fine in windows
[2015/12/20 18:50:31] <Tobbi> What about overhead?
[2015/12/20 18:50:59] <datahead7777> We were trying to upgrade versions of Cegui, and Quintus discovered that there was a bug present in Windows but not Linux related to units for angles representation
[2015/12/20 18:51:07] <alket> idk, OpenDungeons has CEGUI and devs use Windows
[2015/12/20 18:51:09] <datahead7777> They said they were going to look at it, so it may be fixed by now
[2015/12/20 18:51:31] <datahead7777> Anyways, it made me wonder if they test Windows as thoroughly as Linux
[2015/12/20 18:52:02] <Karkus> leyyin_: The c# editor is going out-of-date with no-one to develop it, and it's not so portable. Cobble is just old. The in-game one won't be easy to add more complex ideas to, so Tobbi suggested I develop flexlay.
[2015/12/20 18:52:21] <Karkus> leyyin_: What do we need from TilED?
[2015/12/20 18:52:33] <leyyin_> idk
[2015/12/20 18:52:39] <alket> how do I run flexlay
[2015/12/20 18:52:46] <Tobbi> alket: Have you downloaded it?
[2015/12/20 18:52:47] <leyyin_> why do you have two active editors?
[2015/12/20 18:52:54] <Tobbi> If so, just run ./supertux-editor
[2015/12/20 18:52:56] <alket> Tobbi: i have the source
[2015/12/20 18:53:04] <Karkus> https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/wiki/Installing-the-Flexlay-SuperTux-editor
[2015/12/20 18:53:08] <Tobbi> Oh, yeah.
[2015/12/20 18:53:45] <Karkus> alket: If you have problems, speak to me.
[2015/12/20 18:53:55] <Karkus> I wrote the article
[2015/12/20 18:53:59] <alket> why PyQt4 though
[2015/12/20 18:54:17] <Tobbi> alket: as opposed to?
[2015/12/20 18:54:26] <leyyin_> PyQt5?
[2015/12/20 18:54:42] <alket> yep
[2015/12/20 18:54:56] <Karkus> It's out of date, I guess
[2015/12/20 18:55:02] <Tobbi> leyyin_: If you want to upgrade, sure, do a pull request, it was on my todo list.
[2015/12/20 18:55:11] <Tobbi> but hell, you suggested it, it's your project now.
[2015/12/20 18:55:16] <leyyin_> Tobbi, I was asking, I did not know the answer
[2015/12/20 18:55:27] <Karkus> leyyin_: The answer is yes. You have 2 weeks
[2015/12/20 18:55:32] <leyyin_> damn
[2015/12/20 18:55:33] <Tobbi> leyyin_: That's how it worked with Mozilla back in those days... :D
[2015/12/20 18:55:36] * leyyin_ starts work
[2015/12/20 18:55:49] <Karkus> leyyin_: :D
[2015/12/20 18:56:03] <leyyin_> how hard can it be?
[2015/12/20 18:56:06] <Karkus> leyyin_: I don't think it'll take much
[2015/12/20 18:56:07] <leyyin_> "famous last words"
[2015/12/20 18:56:30] <Karkus> leyyin_: Are you considering this?
[2015/12/20 18:56:59] <leyyin_> hmm, I tend to answer no
[2015/12/20 18:57:15] <Karkus> leyyin_: Awwwwwww...
[2015/12/20 18:57:15] <alket> Karkus: editor looks awesome
[2015/12/20 18:57:20] <leyyin_> because my plate is kinda full and I do not want to promise anything
[2015/12/20 18:57:32] <Tobbi> It worked for you, so quickly, alket?
[2015/12/20 18:57:37] <alket> the message about "Select supertux directory" should make it clear that it wants data directory
[2015/12/20 18:57:41] <Tobbi> leyyin_: I can understand. It's okay.
[2015/12/20 18:57:45] <alket> Tobbi: yeah, why not ?
[2015/12/20 18:57:54] <Tobbi> alket: because python and pyqt...
[2015/12/20 18:58:00] <Karkus> leyyin_: Just for me? Pwease?
[2015/12/20 18:58:00] <Tobbi> I had to install it using macports etc.
[2015/12/20 18:58:02] <Karkus> ahaha
[2015/12/20 18:58:14] <Karkus> leyyin_: jk
[2015/12/20 18:58:21] <leyyin_> Tobbi, python and pyqt are portable ;)
[2015/12/20 18:58:31] <Tobbi> leyyin_: Unlike your mum :D
[2015/12/20 18:58:33] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/20 18:58:39] <leyyin_> at least my mama is not fat
[2015/12/20 18:58:45] <Tobbi> leyyin_: I was implying that...
[2015/12/20 18:58:46] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is your mum portable?
[2015/12/20 18:58:50] <Tobbi> That she'd be fat...
[2015/12/20 18:58:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: bad question...
[2015/12/20 18:59:05] <Tobbi> let's switch topics.
[2015/12/20 18:59:10] <Tobbi> I know these jokes are getting old.
[2015/12/20 18:59:15] <leyyin_> let's talk about your papa Tobbi
[2015/12/20 18:59:20] <Tobbi> leyyin_: I'd rather not.
[2015/12/20 18:59:33] <alket> wut wut
[2015/12/20 18:59:43] <leyyin_> I'm going to sleep, good night open source freaks
[2015/12/20 18:59:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: Can you add leyyin to supertux so I can assign him to the PyQt5 issue please Tobbi? :D
[2015/12/20 18:59:47] <alket> well pyqt4-python3 is one cmd away in linux
[2015/12/20 18:59:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: I could do that.
[2015/12/20 18:59:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 19:00:00] <Karkus> Just kidding :P
[2015/12/20 19:00:03] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 19:00:08] <leyyin_> I should not hang around here anymore
[2015/12/20 19:00:09] <leyyin_> :P
[2015/12/20 19:00:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's how it works with head8debian. You assign random stuff to him and he works on that.

[2015/12/20 19:00:46] <leyyin_> I already have assigned a lot of issues on STK, did not even bother to do them :P
[2015/12/20 19:01:01] <Karkus> 4 stars !!!!!
[2015/12/20 19:01:22] <leyyin_> Karkus, awww, got mail
[2015/12/20 19:01:35] <leyyin_> hiker is gonna kill me
[2015/12/20 19:01:42] <Karkus> Huh?
[2015/12/20 19:01:54] <alket> well in all seriousness, there is nothing that Tiled can't do
[2015/12/20 19:01:59] <Tobbi> leyyin_: You are not obliged to do anything, you know that? Neither for stk not for st.
[2015/12/20 19:02:03] <Tobbi> *nor
[2015/12/20 19:02:19] <leyyin_> Tobbi, you know I am joking, right? ;)
[2015/12/20 19:02:22] <leyyin_> I know that
[2015/12/20 19:02:22] <leyyin_> duh
[2015/12/20 19:02:24] <Tobbi> Oh, right.
[2015/12/20 19:02:39] <Tobbi> Yes. I sometimes don't even get when you're joking anymore.
[2015/12/20 19:02:46] <Tobbi> But people say it's the same to me.
[2015/12/20 19:03:03] <Tobbi> When I casually talk about serial killers and everything in English conversation :D
[2015/12/20 19:03:03] <Karkus> leyyin_: I have deleted the comment, of course
[2015/12/20 19:03:03] <leyyin_> me neither, I get involved on my own plots, that I start believing them myself
[2015/12/20 19:03:11] <Karkus> leyyin_: Who is hiker?
[2015/12/20 19:03:19] <Tobbi> You don't want to know :D
[2015/12/20 19:03:22] <leyyin_> the master of STK
[2015/12/20 19:03:24] <Karkus> alket: Except, erm, make supertux levels?
[2015/12/20 19:03:55] <Karkus> leyyin_: But, you know, if you get a few spare minutes...
[2015/12/20 19:03:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: hiker = the "tobbi" of SuperTuxKart.
[2015/12/20 19:04:03] <alket> Karkus: do you want me to do it so I can prove it to you ? :p
[2015/12/20 19:04:07] <Tobbi> Everyone looks up to him, when he passes by, people look down.
[2015/12/20 19:04:08] <leyyin_> only he has a wife and kids :P
[2015/12/20 19:04:09] <Tobbi> Just like me.
[2015/12/20 19:04:12] <leyyin_> and a job
[2015/12/20 19:04:13] <Tobbi> leyyin_: Damn it.
[2015/12/20 19:04:16] <Tobbi> Don't remind me.
[2015/12/20 19:04:22] <Karkus> alket: No, but that's the point I'm making.
[2015/12/20 19:04:37] <leyyin_> and almost twice your age Tobbi
[2015/12/20 19:04:39] <leyyin_> so relax
[2015/12/20 19:04:40] <Karkus> Tobbi: :D
[2015/12/20 19:04:45] <alket> wait, flexlay is around since 2002 ?
[2015/12/20 19:04:48] <Tobbi> leyyin_: Okay...
[2015/12/20 19:04:52] <Tobbi> leyyin_: How old's he?
[2015/12/20 19:05:00] <Karkus> alket: Yeah... not me.
[2015/12/20 19:05:01] <leyyin_> around 40?
[2015/12/20 19:05:04] <leyyin_> idk really
[2015/12/20 19:05:18] <Tobbi> Okay, I am still relaxed.
[2015/12/20 19:05:19] <Karkus> alket: That's grumbel, he's been working on this for ages.
[2015/12/20 19:05:59] @ Quit: leyyin_: Quit: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
[2015/12/20 19:06:29] <alket> grumbel should work on Pingus, ST has enough devs :p
[2015/12/20 19:06:41] <Tobbi> There is no such thing as "enough devs"
[2015/12/20 19:06:42] <Karkus> alket: We do?
[2015/12/20 19:06:43] <Tobbi> Not for supertux.
[2015/12/20 19:06:55] <Karkus> alket: Can you program?
[2015/12/20 19:07:20] <alket> Karkus: no
[2015/12/20 19:07:23] <alket> just script
[2015/12/20 19:07:30] <Tobbi> Python is "just script"!.
[2015/12/20 19:07:32] <Karkus> alket: Python is scripting..
[2015/12/20 19:07:35] <Tobbi> hah
[2015/12/20 19:07:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: Damn touch typing
[2015/12/20 19:08:01] <alket> yeah I know some python
[2015/12/20 19:08:19] <Karkus> alket: How many is some? 5, 6, 19?
[2015/12/20 19:08:31] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 19:08:47] <Tobbi> 19 python...
[2015/12/20 19:09:18] <Karkus> I suppose, 19 pythons
[2015/12/20 19:09:23] <Tobbi> No, python is a unit of measurement.
[2015/12/20 19:09:39] <alket> yeah 19
[2015/12/20 19:09:53] <Karkus> alket: Sounds like https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/issues/42 is the perfect issue for you to fix
[2015/12/20 19:10:40] <Tobbi> Agreed.
[2015/12/20 19:10:42] <Tobbi> Plus, we need it.
[2015/12/20 19:10:53] <Karkus> alket: I'm just kidding, I'm not looking forward to that one.
[2015/12/20 19:11:18] <Tobbi> Maybe it'll be easy eventually.
[2015/12/20 19:11:24] <alket> Karkus: tiled should fix that :p
[2015/12/20 19:12:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: Maybe TilED is an option...
[2015/12/20 19:12:27] <Karkus> idk, I like flexlay, and I've done quite a bit of work on it.
[2015/12/20 19:12:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: It could be.
[2015/12/20 19:12:39] <Tobbi> But, wouldn't we be starting from scratch?
[2015/12/20 19:12:55] <alket> Karkus: your work made Milestone II possible
[2015/12/20 19:13:07] <Karkus> alket: Well, no...
[2015/12/20 19:13:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah, almost...
[2015/12/20 19:13:39] <Tobbi> On the other hand: We'd be handing off some of the work...
[2015/12/20 19:14:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: On the third hand, we'd have 5 editors...
[2015/12/20 19:14:06] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 19:14:08] <Tobbi> Not good.
[2015/12/20 19:14:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: We seriously need to make a decision.
[2015/12/20 19:14:22] <Tobbi> Yes...
[2015/12/20 19:14:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: Shall I make a poll?
[2015/12/20 19:14:33] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, and add some pro / contra arguments.
[2015/12/20 19:14:41] <Karkus> Tobbi: I know people will choose TilED...
[2015/12/20 19:14:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: But can we integrate scripting with TilED
[2015/12/20 19:14:58] <Karkus> Oh, well, flexlay can be a side project :P
[2015/12/20 19:15:04] <Tobbi> Not another side project...
[2015/12/20 19:15:05] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/20 19:16:11] <alket> don't mind me, work like you like, opensource its about devs not users
[2015/12/20 19:16:21] <alket> your are not getting paid for this xD
[2015/12/20 19:17:15] <alket> you can do what grumbel suggested
[2015/12/20 19:17:16] <Tobbi> alket: To be honest, we considered accepting donations to pay for a nice car for me.
[2015/12/20 19:17:27] <alket> xd
[2015/12/20 19:17:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: We're overdue on 0.5.0 by 1 day now!
[2015/12/20 19:18:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: what?
[2015/12/20 19:18:09] <Tobbi> No, no, no.
[2015/12/20 19:19:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, that's what it says on GitHub. Of course, I know it's been released...

[2015/12/21 04:05:33] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2015/12/21 04:06:03] <Hume2> Can Flexlay make translucent gradients?
[2015/12/21 04:06:07] <brmbrmcar> But look at your copy (if you actually installed one). Get into that exact position.
[2015/12/21 04:12:52] @ tux|dude joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/21 04:13:26] <Hume2> And can Flexlay make translucent lanterns?
[2015/12/21 04:16:05] <brmbrmcar> I haven't a clue.
[2015/12/21 04:16:21] <Hume2> My in-game editor can that.
[2015/12/21 04:17:17] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2015/12/21 04:17:38] <brmbrmcar> Do you know how those lanterns and blocks are done?
[2015/12/21 04:17:47] <brmbrmcar> My blocks just stay solid.
[2015/12/21 04:17:54] <brmbrmcar> Always.
[2015/12/21 04:18:31] <Hume2> It looks like I'm really a pro for "What we currently have in SuperTux".
[2015/12/21 04:18:51] <Hume2> Just add alpha to their colour.
[2015/12/21 04:19:10] <Hume2> ...the alpha chanel
[2015/12/21 04:19:29] <brmbrmcar> Alpha? OK...
[2015/12/21 04:19:55] <brmbrmcar> Where is alpho channel?
[2015/12/21 04:20:14] <Hume2> For example half-opaque red is: 1 0 0 0.5

[2015/12/21 04:33:41] <brmbrmcar> Got it.
[2015/12/21 04:33:52] * brmbrmcar cannot read today
[2015/12/21 04:35:09] <brmbrmcar> So,     (magicblock
[2015/12/21 04:35:10] <brmbrmcar>       (color 1 1 0)
[2015/12/21 04:35:10] <brmbrmcar>       (x 1024)

[2015/12/21 04:35:12] <brmbrmcar>     )?
[2015/12/21 04:35:34] <Hume2> Yes.
[2015/12/21 04:35:46] <brmbrmcar> It was like that before, though.
[2015/12/21 04:35:57] <brmbrmcar> And I still get the same problem.
[2015/12/21 04:36:02] <Hume2> Also note that the translucent lanterns light less.
[2015/12/21 04:36:18] <Hume2> (color 1 1 0 <alpha>)
[2015/12/21 04:36:33] <brmbrmcar> Copy that directly?
[2015/12/21 04:36:36] <Hume2> 1 is opaque, 0 is transparent.
[2015/12/21 04:36:50] <Hume2> 0.5 is half-opaque.
[2015/12/21 04:37:05] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/21 04:37:51] @ alket joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/21 04:39:12] <Hume2> Totally transparent lanterns don't glow at all, so they work only like invisible rocks.
[2015/12/21 04:39:48] <brmbrmcar> What about the actual blocks? That is what I was originally asking about.
[2015/12/21 04:40:04] <brmbrmcar> The alpha did nothing to them.
[2015/12/21 04:41:04] <Hume2> Magicblocks aren't affected by alpha though.
[2015/12/21 04:41:28] <Hume2> Because they have their own alpha.
[2015/12/21 04:43:50] <brmbrmcar> Why are they always solid?
[2015/12/21 04:44:06] <brmbrmcar> Thats what I wante to know how to fix.
[2015/12/21 04:45:17] <Hume2> It works for lanterns, but not for magicblocks.

[2015/12/21 06:54:39] <Tobbi> Hume2: I am.
[2015/12/21 06:54:52] <Tobbi> This was huge, yesterday.
[2015/12/21 06:55:01] <Tobbi> Well, actually, I slept, so I am feeling alright.
[2015/12/21 06:55:27] <Hume2> Yes, you went to bed in half past one in the night.
[2015/12/21 06:55:43] <Tobbi> stewboy: Did you play supertux before?
[2015/12/21 06:55:55] <stewboy> yes...
[2015/12/21 06:55:56] <Tobbi> Hume2: Which is early for me.
[2015/12/21 06:56:02] <stewboy> would it have shared the folder with earlier versions
[2015/12/21 06:56:19] <Tobbi> stewboy: Most likely. What OS are you on?
[2015/12/21 06:56:23] <stewboy> Windows
[2015/12/21 06:56:53] <Tobbi> stewboy: Open %USERPROFILE%/.supertux2
[2015/12/21 06:57:16] <stewboy> yep
[2015/12/21 06:57:21] <Tobbi> Okay, now open profile1.
[2015/12/21 06:57:36] <Tobbi> And then you should find stsg files for the world you're playing in there.
[2015/12/21 06:57:42] <Tobbi> Tux's position is stored there.
[2015/12/21 06:57:50] <stewboy> ah, okay
[2015/12/21 06:58:35] <Tobbi> So, if you delete it, or set it to 0'0, it should find the home position :P
[2015/12/21 06:58:38] <Tobbi> I think that's in the code.
[2015/12/21 06:58:50] <stewboy> I've already started playing through half the levels anyway, so that's fine

[2015/12/21 07:03:15] <stewboy> well, doesn't matter now in any case
[2015/12/21 07:03:26] <Hume2> Tobbi: Therefore I can close the issue on Mantis and redirect the discussion to GitHub.
[2015/12/21 07:03:36] <Tobbi> Hume2: No, you can't.
[2015/12/21 07:03:39] <Tobbi> Keep it open, please.
[2015/12/21 07:03:45] <Tobbi> We're more likely to look at the github one.
[2015/12/21 07:03:49] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2015/12/21 07:03:53] <Tobbi> Yes, you can.
[2015/12/21 07:03:55] <Tobbi> Sorry.
[2015/12/21 07:04:37] <stewboy> another piece of feedback I have, and I don't know how useful it's going to be, is that I really hate voc-daytime2.ogg. The melody is way way too jagged and random, the chord progression is too simple, and the instrument just gets on my nerves really quickly. To be honest it feels like a very low effort track. Voc-night.ogg has very similar problems but the more mellow tone quality to the instrumen
[2015/12/21 07:04:38] <stewboy> ts means it doesn't get as annoying, and I get the atmosphere that the composer was after. Voc-daytime.ogg is more listenable, though it still feels slightly uninspired.
[2015/12/21 07:04:47] <stewboy> ah didn't mean for that to cut across aw ord
[2015/12/21 07:04:49] <stewboy> a word*
[2015/12/21 07:06:17] <Hume2> My ears don't work properly, so I should rather not try to fix that.
[2015/12/21 07:06:30] <stewboy> I remember these tracks have been around in development for a while... I probably should've said something earlier but to be honest I mostly forgot about supertux until just now when milestone 2 was released
[2015/12/21 07:06:54] <stewboy> yeah, it's probably fine for most people, but for a musician like me it's just incredibly grating

[2015/12/21 07:36:43] <leyyin> tbh, it would be nice, if you can make levels with tiled, multiple people developing one awesome tiled editor
[2015/12/21 07:36:53] <Tobbi> leyyin: Not that again.

[2015/12/21 07:38:10] <Tobbi> leyyin: We need an export plugin or need to modify supertux...

[2015/12/21 07:40:02] <leyyin> it usually means fixing bugs for STK :P
[2015/12/21 07:40:06] <leyyin> the day after release

[2015/12/21 10:14:15] <Tobbi> alket: So, in order to use them, you open the editor and use them :P
[2015/12/21 10:14:33] <Tobbi> Each tile has an id.
[2015/12/21 10:14:47] <Tobbi> So each part of that image has a different ID.

[2015/12/21 10:20:09] <Tobbi> I guess that can be considered good.
[2015/12/21 10:20:17] <alket> that can be considered awesome

[2015/12/21 10:28:08] <Tobbi> Maybe MS 2 release generated far more traction than 0.3.5a

[2015/12/21 11:25:19] <mt> phoronix also worded it a bit strange, suggesting that this is an entirely new development
[2015/12/21 11:25:32] <mt> I mean, M2 has been in development since 2006 or so
[2015/12/21 11:25:52] <Tobbi> mt: Compared to 0.1.3, it is.
[2015/12/21 11:25:58] <mt> sure

[2015/12/21 12:47:43] <head8debian> jesusalva: :)
[2015/12/21 12:48:18] <jesusalva> ...git is fairly simple, as long that you do as me and resume the universe to "git commit -a" "git add" "git pull" "git push" and "git init".
[2015/12/21 12:48:32] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: What do you run to identify your bot?
[2015/12/21 12:48:42] <jesusalva> The only 5 git commands I use. "git commit -a" is 90% of my experience with git.
[2015/12/21 12:48:48] <brmbrmcar> jesusalva:I HATE GIT!

[2015/12/21 12:50:35] * jesusalva likes git, but recognizes that when something traumatizes you, you hate it -- and nothing will change your mind about that.
[2015/12/21 12:50:47] <jesusalva> It's a defense from your body.

[2015/12/21 13:32:36] <mt> Hume2: better start already including tests for the editor
[2015/12/21 13:32:51] <mt> then we don't have to do that after merging it
[2015/12/21 13:33:21] <brmbrmcar> Yeah.
[2015/12/21 13:33:31] <Hume2> mt: Like test levels for editor?
[2015/12/21 13:33:34] <brmbrmcar> The editor is for 0.4.1.
[2015/12/21 13:33:41] <mt> Hume2: nope unit tests
[2015/12/21 13:33:51] <mt> for making sure the editor works as expected
[2015/12/21 13:33:57] <mt> see the tests/ directory
[2015/12/21 13:34:00] <brmbrmcar> Which is next release.
[2015/12/21 13:34:22] <mt> brmbrmcar: stay quiet about your 0.4.1 bullshit. seriously now
[2015/12/21 13:34:44] <mt> the editor is not a bugfix. therefore it won't be 0.4.1 but 0.5.0
[2015/12/21 13:34:47] <brmbrmcar> In my opinion it should be merged altogether.
[2015/12/21 13:36:50] <Hume2> mt: I have never done such things, so I could do something wrong.
[2015/12/21 13:37:02] <Hume2> ...but I'll try.

[2015/12/21 13:39:04] <mt> brmbrmcar: you seem to understand something wrong there
[2015/12/21 13:39:35] <mt> if there's enough bugs in 0.4.1, we'll fix then in master and release/0.4, and create 0.4.1 from the release/0.4 branch
[2015/12/21 13:39:38] <Karkus> Hume2: If you've never done it before, now's a good time to learn. Tests are very handy for people new to the code to understand how it works, as well
[2015/12/21 13:39:56] <mt> the editor can be merged, but if it is, the next release will be 0.5.0 and not 0.4.1
[2015/12/21 13:40:16] <mt> however, it'd be nice to have something more, like a new world in 0.5.0
[2015/12/21 13:40:34] <Karkus> mt: We need to fix/redo the forest world first
[2015/12/21 13:40:36] <Hume2> mt: See my pull request.
[2015/12/21 13:40:40] <brmbrmcar> But then you'll be complaining about there being NOWHERE NEAR enough releases to cover 1.0.0 at the end of it.
[2015/12/21 13:40:54] <brmbrmcar> Milestone 3 is before 1.0.0!

[2015/12/21 13:43:35] <mt> I agree that forest world needs a clear structure
[2015/12/21 13:43:45] <mt> And as you said, maybe some special features

[2015/12/21 13:47:34] <mt> Karkus: can you open an issue with a tickable list for things that need to be fixed in 0.5.0?
[2015/12/21 13:47:51] <Karkus> mt: Forest world things?
[2015/12/21 13:48:01] <mt> then we can go on and partially fix them using PRs or commits to master; yes, forest world issues

[2015/12/21 13:49:01] <Hume2> There's still no exact consistent plan how the forest world should look like.
[2015/12/21 13:49:48] <mt> well I think there was this plain forest, ghostforest, nolok's castles idea
[2015/12/21 13:49:49] <Hume2> I got an idea!
[2015/12/21 13:50:06] <mt> we could make use of the halloween tiles for parts of ghostforest
[2015/12/21 13:50:06] <Hume2> Let's make a worldmap contest.
[2015/12/21 13:50:14] <mt> +1
[2015/12/21 13:50:47] <Hume2> And using halloween tiles for ghostforest is a good idea too.
[2015/12/21 13:51:01] <Hume2> Well, the contest:
[2015/12/21 13:51:03] <mt> the halloween tiles is just a start
[2015/12/21 13:51:15] <mt> ghostforest would probably need some more tweaks

[2015/12/21 13:53:49] <mt> but we can say ghostforest tiles is another issue
[2015/12/21 13:54:08] * jesusalva doesn't thinks that the problem is on the Forest World, but rather, on how it's supposed to connect to the main story.
[2015/12/21 13:54:28] <mt> jesusalva: can you elaborate?
[2015/12/21 13:57:31] <jesusalva> You can bend two things: The levels, redoing them -- which means lots of work, or the story, which means lots of creativity. If you're creative enough, you can make the forest levels as they are connect perfectly with the story and do a very beautiful picture. Or you can simply redo all the levels and the map so they fit the current story.
[2015/12/21 13:58:15] <jesusalva> Naturally, you don't need to prejudice the story to fit the worldmap. Sometimes is pretty simple, but the way as we face the problem make we only see the hardest of the ways.
[2015/12/21 13:58:19] <mt> I meant: what's wrong with the current story?
[2015/12/21 13:58:46] <jesusalva> Everything and nothing.
[2015/12/21 13:59:17] <jesusalva> How to explain...

[2015/12/21 14:00:55] <jesusalva> Nothing in the game is wrong. The maps are correct, the worldmap is correct, the story is correct. But they don't connect one to other. You can refit the levels, or create a bridge on the story in a way that you need to do minimal changes to map.

[2015/12/21 14:04:20] <jesusalva> You cannot go beyond the forest to more equatorial areas because you don't have any way to keep yourself cool in such journey.

[2015/12/21 14:07:48] <Karkus> mt, Hume2: Shall we just agree to redo the forest world entirely?
[2015/12/21 14:07:54] <Karkus> Keep levels
[2015/12/21 14:07:58] <Karkus> but change worldmap
[2015/12/21 14:08:04] <Hume2> Karkus: I agree.
[2015/12/21 14:08:09] <mt> let's rather try to understand what jesusalva means first
[2015/12/21 14:08:17] <Hume2> :D
[2015/12/21 14:08:25] <Hume2> * had no time to read that.
[2015/12/21 14:08:28] <mt> jesusalva: so you think we should allow the user to travel around with a ship?
[2015/12/21 14:08:48] <mt> we've actually already had something similar in 0.3.0 and 0.3.1
[2015/12/21 14:08:54] <mt> but it got removed for some reason
[2015/12/21 14:09:12] <lumidify> I just think the levels are a bit too independent; if they somehow relied on each other more, it would press people to go on.
[2015/12/21 14:09:20] <jesusalva> My idea is pretty basic. We received a map from Penny with Nolok fortress, right?
[2015/12/21 14:09:28] <Hume2> mt: Yes, but it was only travel from A to B.
[2015/12/21 14:09:37] <mt> Hume2: I know
[2015/12/21 14:09:50] <jesusalva> But it's kinda obvious none of them is the correct, if I was Nolok, I would have a secret fortress.
[2015/12/21 14:10:03] <Hume2> jesusalva: That way it would be possible to travel to the final world skipping all the other ones.
[2015/12/21 14:10:10] <Karkus> jesusalva: Bowser never bothered with that
[2015/12/21 14:10:19] <jesusalva> Hume2: That's what is with the "go on"
[2015/12/21 14:10:27] <mt> well actually kind of a good idea
[2015/12/21 14:10:29] <jesusalva> We can A) hide the correct fortress
[2015/12/21 14:10:39] <mt> Bowser never bothered, but we can do that different
[2015/12/21 14:10:58] <jesusalva> Or B) each level on the final fortress rely on something (item, whatever) which you can only obtain cleaning a certain castle first.
[2015/12/21 14:11:09] <Karkus> mt: I suppose he did... "Your princess is in another castle"
[2015/12/21 14:11:17] <brmbrmcar> I clearly can't have anopnion on this.
[2015/12/21 14:11:19] <mt> I think possibly a combination of A and B, jesusalva
[2015/12/21 14:11:20] <lumidify> That's exactly what I thought - more "inter-level" items.
[2015/12/21 14:11:26] <Hume2> I'm for B.
[2015/12/21 14:11:59] <mt> make some castles only appear when you have collected some specific items and then make them unlock a final castle

[2015/12/21 14:12:42] <Karkus> It's pointless talking about this right now. We need to fix the forest world first...
[2015/12/21 14:12:49] <mt> no
[2015/12/21 14:12:55] <Hume2> mt: Yeah, but try to think some those specific items.
[2015/12/21 14:13:03] <jesusalva> In another one idea based on mt's, you go to the *correct* fortress and find a gap. But on another fortress where Penny isn't there, is a item which helps to cross it, or a map which shows that there is a secret passage to cross the gap.
[2015/12/21 14:13:31] <mt> Karkus: if we fix forest world without having that discussed, we'd possibly have done much work for nothing
[2015/12/21 14:13:57] <Karkus> mt: If we fix the forest world, people will have two stable worlds to play...
[2015/12/21 14:14:22] <lumidify> The forest world already includes keys to unlock the fortress, so it would be interesting to have different items as jesusalva suggested.
[2015/12/21 14:14:29] <mt> I think jesusalva is right we need to fix the story
[2015/12/21 14:14:31] <brmbrmcar> Just follow the plans!
[2015/12/21 14:14:45] <Hume2> LOL there are no plans.
[2015/12/21 14:15:03] <mt> lumidify: sure, I'd possibly think even items the player doesn't know they exist before they find them
[2015/12/21 14:15:21] <brmbrmcar> In the wiki!
[2015/12/21 14:15:44] <mt> brmbrmcar: the plans in the wiki are old and not relevant anymore
[2015/12/21 14:15:57] <Hume2> Exactly.

[2015/12/21 14:17:09] <brmbrmcar> Right.

[2015/12/21 14:27:05] <jesusalva> For starters, the hidden fortress could be a single-level which the only obstacle is the gap, and after completing it, a "victory text"
[2015/12/21 14:27:05] <jesusalva> And the glaciers can be 3 levels, on the end you find a ladder -- or anything fancy which can help you to cross the gap.
[2015/12/21 14:27:34] <mt> so you can't use the ship to get to the tropical area/ghostforest?
[2015/12/21 14:27:51] <jesusalva> Of course, with more levels, and more elaborated, it would be much more fun, you could get items which you have no idea why is that, and then as you advance "Ah! That item was for that".
[2015/12/21 14:27:59] <jesusalva> mt: The idea rely on that
[2015/12/21 14:28:13] <mt> Sounds great, was just making that sure.
[2015/12/21 14:28:21] <Karkus> jesusalva: This isn't how items work in SuperTux though...
[2015/12/21 14:28:23] <mt> Needs some code-related work as well, however.
[2015/12/21 14:28:43] <jesusalva> Yes, but if you want a quick release, two variables may be enough.
[2015/12/21 14:29:25] <jesusalva> Not sure if you can hide something from the world map. If you can't, you can add two challenges on the "final fortress level", which you need to complete the two previous levels.
[2015/12/21 14:29:34] <mt> For the glaciers we could keep it relatively simple at the beginning
[2015/12/21 14:29:42] <jesusalva> Or some item which helps you to use the ladder, which can be found on the ghost forest.
[2015/12/21 14:29:49] <jesusalva> mt: Yes, exactly.
[2015/12/21 14:29:51] <mt> Say, the player receives an ice floe or an iceberg
[2015/12/21 14:29:58] <mt> instead of using the ship
[2015/12/21 14:31:09] <jesusalva> Could be, but I think the player will need something a bit more sturdy to reach the forest.
[2015/12/21 14:31:11] <mt> jesusalva: re hide from worldmap: worldmaps are scriptable and layered as are levels
[2015/12/21 14:31:40] <mt> there's even a secret area trigger in some worldmaps iirc
[2015/12/21 14:32:02] <mt> (-> Bonus Island III)
[2015/12/21 14:32:04] <jesusalva> mt: Then it's kinda simple, I guess.
[2015/12/21 14:32:18] <jesusalva> As long that you can keep the variables.
[2015/12/21 14:32:20] <mt> So, any better ideas than icebergs, icefloes?
[2015/12/21 14:33:06] <jesusalva> You can get a raft
[2015/12/21 14:33:25] <jesusalva> You can't go beyond the forest because the waters are too strong
[2015/12/21 14:33:37] <mt> head8debian, giby, Tobbi (if you're reading the log): reading this backlog is worth it imho
[2015/12/21 14:34:27] <mt> I like that idea, but am still waiting for better ideas :)

[2015/12/21 14:40:50] <Karkus> jesusalva: Okay, I like your idea, but I don't think having a final boss is a good idea. It could imply that SuperTux is completed.
[2015/12/21 14:41:12] <Karkus> jesusalva: Right now, I mean.
[2015/12/21 14:41:13] <brmbrmcar> "not complain about the channel ops". I hate this server!
[2015/12/21 14:41:32] <mt> Karkus: we could make a forest boss that's not Nolok
[2015/12/21 14:41:54] <Karkus> mt: We have a boss at the moment..
[2015/12/21 14:42:08] <mt> and in the next release we can add another island (or multiple islands) and a method to get to it and another boss
[2015/12/21 14:42:20] <brmbrmcar> I just think Tree Suck needs improving.
[2015/12/21 14:42:21] <mt> and once the game is completed we can add some finals levels
[2015/12/21 14:42:31] <jesusalva> Karkus: And on the last fortress, Nolok doesn't shows up -- so you know that something is missing. Or you add a message: "All right, Nolok is supposed to be here, but... where is he? Where is Penny? Where is everybody??"

[2015/12/21 14:45:26] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/21 14:45:49] <mt> After the player has solved these levels, they will get another item they'll have to use to get to the next island
[2015/12/21 14:45:58] <mt> jesusalva proposed a raft
[2015/12/21 14:46:09] <Karkus> This isn't an adventure game, though.
[2015/12/21 14:46:19] <mt> But you can't get to another island with that as the water will be too strong
[2015/12/21 14:46:44] <mt> Karkus: but these little changes will make the player keep interest
[2015/12/21 14:47:05] <Karkus> mt: I think a good forest world would interest the player...
[2015/12/21 14:47:23] <mt> you need to see the game as a whole
[2015/12/21 14:47:24] <jesusalva> I think so, a ship or sort of. The water strength is for the lack of levels on inital releases, latter you get a better ship. The levels doesn't need to be linear, just like ghost forest, you don't need to do level A, then B, then C. You can do B, C and then A, as long that you need to complete the three to go past level D.
[2015/12/21 14:47:28] <Karkus> Is the contest to plan a forest world, or create a forest world?
[2015/12/21 14:47:49] <mt> Karkus: I think design in this context = create
[2015/12/21 14:48:16] <jesusalva> I also think he wants to create one. After all, we are planning right now, correct?
[2015/12/21 14:48:20] <Karkus> mt: Except, we don't have an agreed upon editor, or scripting API...
[2015/12/21 14:48:25] <brmbrmcar> The ;evels cannot be ina bad difficulty order.
[2015/12/21 14:48:45] <mt> Karkus: the C# editor works for now, as well as does flexlay for basic things
[2015/12/21 14:48:51] <brmbrmcar> And countercurrent particually should only be optional.
[2015/12/21 14:49:01] <jesusalva> brmbrmcar: Yes, maybe levels A B and C must have the same difficulty, and level D (and the ones after that) can be a little harder.
[2015/12/21 14:49:09] <mt> And scripting API, well squirrel seems to be ok and agreed upon

[2015/12/21 14:53:06] <mt> we're just keeping them in mind
[2015/12/21 14:53:07] <jesusalva> Hume2: I think that the more consistent difficulty, the better.
[2015/12/21 14:53:24] <Karkus> jesusalva: You are suggesting it shouldn't get harder?
[2015/12/21 14:53:36] @ Quit: giby: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2015/12/21 14:53:43] <jesusalva> No, but that we need to have a floor and a roof.
[2015/12/21 14:53:45] <mt> Karkus: also, if you want me to create, say these glacier levels, I'll be glad to help with that
[2015/12/21 14:53:51] <Hume2> This was just an example how it's going when someone tries to make it non-linear.
[2015/12/21 14:53:54] <mt> I know how to use the editor
[2015/12/21 14:53:55] <jesusalva> I'm afraid of the player not being able to complete the game.
[2015/12/21 14:54:02] <Karkus> Hume2: Yes, I agree.
[2015/12/21 14:54:25] <Karkus> jesusalva: If you can't complete it, you need to practice.
[2015/12/21 14:54:59] <mt> by using that object needed principle you can actually make it pretty linear
[2015/12/21 14:55:06] <brmbrmcar> I can pass every other level apart from Countercurrent.
[2015/12/21 14:55:10] <jesusalva> The non-linearity I propose is still somewhat linear.
[2015/12/21 14:55:38] <Hume2> The begining is exponencial and the rest is random-difficulty.
[2015/12/21 14:55:40] <Karkus> mt: What objects? Can you give me examples?
[2015/12/21 14:55:43] <mt> like, you still have to do the glacier levels, or complete world1 ot get the ship/raft
[2015/12/21 14:55:51] <jesusalva> Antartica -> "easier" ; Glaciers, Forest -> "Not that hard" ; Final Fortess -> "hard"
[2015/12/21 14:56:08] <mt> and when you're on forest island you can only get one object that's maybe for one or two more islands
[2015/12/21 14:56:21] <mt> you have to finish them in order to get to another island
[2015/12/21 14:56:23] <mt> and so on
[2015/12/21 14:56:30] <Karkus> mt: What objects?
[2015/12/21 14:56:47] <mt> say, after antartica, a ship; after glaciers, a raft
[2015/12/21 14:56:58] <mt> after forest, some piece of wood or something to fly
[2015/12/21 14:57:16] <Karkus> mt: Why not use the ship to get everywhere?
[2015/12/21 14:57:25] <mt> something to fly -> but you can't fly over the mountains, which could be a next difficulty
[2015/12/21 14:57:28] <jesusalva> Good point. It would need to be an incefloat.
[2015/12/21 14:57:31] <jesusalva> *icefloat
[2015/12/21 14:57:32] <mt> Karkus: simply to make it more diverse
[2015/12/21 14:57:51] <Hume2> Or a locked cave entrance.
[2015/12/21 14:58:00] <Karkus> I'm off. I've had enough of this nonsense.
[2015/12/21 14:58:03] @ Karkus left channel #supertux ("Leaving")
[2015/12/21 14:58:06] <Hume2> And then a broken cave lift.
[2015/12/21 14:58:22] <mt> :/
[2015/12/21 14:58:29] <mt> why is that nonsense?
[2015/12/21 14:59:16] <Hume2> I think that it's only confusion.
[2015/12/21 14:59:39] <mt> what I can clarify, if Karkus reads the irclog: I wouldn't require that much work
[2015/12/21 14:59:50] <mt> possibly only changing the sprite of the ship
[2015/12/21 15:00:00] <Hume2> I think so.
[2015/12/21 15:00:48] <mt> it's relatively easy, even for a plane oslt because you look at the worldmap from the top
[2015/12/21 15:00:52] <mt> this isn't a 3D-game

[2015/12/21 15:01:18] <Hume2> Not yet :D
[2015/12/21 15:01:26] <brmbrmcar> What about a cutscene with the whatever happens to Penny and Nolok?
[2015/12/21 15:01:43] <mt> brmbrmcar: we leave that, as it's still true
[2015/12/21 15:01:56] <mt> we can also make some cutscenes on forest island
[2015/12/21 15:02:12] <Hume2> I think that "I thought that penny is here and she isn't" can be used max. once.
[2015/12/21 15:03:03] <mt> what jesusalva also meant is requiring some multiple objects (like the current keys, but also more diverse) for the final castle
[2015/12/21 15:03:11] <mt> where Tux expects Penny
[2015/12/21 15:03:45] <Hume2> For the keys I got another idea: Make the keys to unlock the ghost forest.
[2015/12/21 15:04:05] <Hume2> ...but yes, it's a good idea.
[2015/12/21 15:04:23] <jesusalva> So Nolok would be on Ghost Forest, and you would get the keys from other, different levelsets?
[2015/12/21 15:04:42] <mt> not necessarily
[2015/12/21 15:04:58] <mt> like you could need ghost forest to get some other, global object
[2015/12/21 15:05:05] <brmbrmcar> I just said that,and you bring it up again.
[2015/12/21 15:05:13] <brmbrmcar> The cutscenes.
[2015/12/21 15:05:15] <jesusalva> Just as I thought. ;)
[2015/12/21 15:05:22] <brmbrmcar> That is what Imeant.
[2015/12/21 15:05:23] <Hume2> Let's make keys for all letters of the alphabet and fon't forget ÃÃÃ to convince Tobbi :D
[2015/12/21 15:05:35] <mt> Hume2: not just keys
[2015/12/21 15:05:36] <brmbrmcar> ???
[2015/12/21 15:05:42] <mt> simply also other objects
[2015/12/21 15:05:46] <brmbrmcar> Keys ???
[2015/12/21 15:05:53] <Hume2> Well, we have those crystals!
[2015/12/21 15:05:56] <mt> brmbrmcar: keys in forest island
[2015/12/21 15:06:19] <mt> Hume2: for example, to unlock the final island, you could need a key, a crystal, a piece of wood, a bone, a whatever
[2015/12/21 15:06:32] <Hume2> Could be.
[2015/12/21 15:06:57] <Hume2> The keys could also serve for summoning the boss.
[2015/12/21 15:07:25] <brmbrmcar> What was the keys not to forget to convice Tobbi?

[2015/12/21 15:28:10] <jesusalva> http://i1253.photobucket.com/albums/hh600/pazkero/simple_linearity.png << A linearity example? It's the same, but it have numbers on side. They are the order on which you need to do (the story, linear as it should be), but they repeat (non-linear part).
[2015/12/21 15:28:10] <jesusalva> http://i1253.photobucket.com/albums/hh600/pazkero/complex_linearity.png << Got idle. It was to show how we can have various places to go in random order, but how they are still linear by the blue dots w/ numbers.
[2015/12/21 15:28:20] <jesusalva> The second image is not worth seeing, honestly.
[2015/12/21 15:29:22] <jesusalva> The idea is, by example, that in one cave you get a rope, but it can't support your weight without an item from another cave. (so you can explore the chasms)
[2015/12/21 15:29:53] <jesusalva> If you go in the other order, you think you got an useless item, but when you get the rope, you understand the use of such item.
[2015/12/21 15:30:03] @ Quit: alket: Ping timeout: 265 seconds
[2015/12/21 15:30:57] <jesusalva> And it's still linear, because you cannot venture into the chasms without completing the caves first, and you cannot go on them without the flying pan.
[2015/12/21 15:33:11] <jesusalva> oops, typo on the image.
[2015/12/21 15:35:14] <jesusalva> Second image is bad, see this one instead: http://i1253.photobucket.com/albums/hh600/pazkero/complex_linearity_1.png (still fails to deliver a clear vision about that)
[2015/12/21 15:36:15] <jesusalva> The blue line was wrong. It was to prevent you from reaching the final chamber too early. (You need the keys to enter, anyway). It's said what the crystal is for in some level.
[2015/12/21 15:37:40] <jesusalva> That's it for now. Just proofs-of-concept anyway, the 2nd of how the final product could end up looking -- but focus on the simple first. Or you may never end the game. You can also use the linearity numbers to base the difficulty.

[2015/12/21 16:48:28] <jesusalva> Hello Karkus
[2015/12/21 16:54:50] <Karkus> Hello jesusalva, did you and mt come up with any decisions?
[2015/12/21 16:56:24] <jesusalva> You can see in logs, right? I came up with two images to show how linear and how non-linear my idea was. mt did some useful comments and explained to Hume2 and the talk died after a while.
[2015/12/21 16:57:32] <jesusalva> http://i1253.photobucket.com/albums/hh600/pazkero/complex_linearity_1.png ==> I think you should look at this image. It's meant to be a proof of concept of the final product, with linearity drawings on it.
[2015/12/21 16:58:12] <jesusalva> The game follows the sequence of the blue dots (You do dot 1, then dot 2, then dot 3, etc.) but you can only advance to, say, dot 4, after completting all dot 3's first.
[2015/12/21 16:58:42] <jesusalva> (Altough we can add extra, bonus levels on the world map after you get a certain transport, as written on the side)
[2015/12/21 16:58:57] * jesusalva switches subjects.
[2015/12/21 16:59:13] <Karkus> jesusalva: Okay, I guess I do like your idea.
[2015/12/21 16:59:36] <Karkus> jesusalva: There are still problems, but it's definitely worth considering.
[2015/12/21 16:59:49] <jesusalva> Tell the problems, so they can be fixed. ;)
[2015/12/21 17:00:10] <Karkus> jesusalva: How does the player know which object they need?
[2015/12/21 17:01:23] <jesusalva> Worth of considering. I think on those "!" boxes, but without saying the object in an explicit way, but giving an idea of: "This gap is too big to jump. I'll need something which can be used as a bridge to cross it."
[2015/12/21 17:02:22] <jesusalva> Then you find a ladder/wooden plank which when you met you say "This (item) is very big. I wonder how it will fit in my pockets, I better leave it at my (raft)"
[2015/12/21 17:03:05] <jesusalva> The idea is to the player think if he couldn't use the ladder to cross the gap, instead of saying "I need a big wooden plank or something of the sort to cross this gap."
[2015/12/21 17:03:25] <jesusalva> (Unless you think that explicit is better. No objections from me.)
[2015/12/21 17:05:45] <Karkus> jesusalva: My opinion on this is that it's somewhat ambiguous. I don't see any advantage of this over just giving the player the world after they complete the previous one...
[2015/12/21 17:06:02] <Karkus> jesusalva: As in - the player might just be confused
[2015/12/21 17:06:55] <jesusalva> As long that he knows that he must find Penny, and there may be some interesting stuff to north, it should be all right.
[2015/12/21 17:07:27] <jesusalva> But the player is also free to explore the whole world and select the order he wants to do things: As long he is still following the "blue dots" sequence.
[2015/12/21 17:07:49] <jesusalva> (The simple scheme I gave is there: http://i1253.photobucket.com/albums/hh600/pazkero/simple_linearity.png  )
[2015/12/21 17:08:13] <jesusalva> (Because the other one is too complex, so let's not assume that many worlds anyway)
[2015/12/21 17:09:16] <Karkus> jesusalva: To be honest, I can't picture it working with our graphics style either...
[2015/12/21 17:09:37] <Karkus> Would it be like a normal worldmap?
[2015/12/21 17:10:13] <alket> jesusalva: looks nice
[2015/12/21 17:12:32] <Karkus> jesusalva: Idk. Can we see what other people think later?

[2015/12/21 17:23:00] <jesusalva> Yes.
[2015/12/21 17:23:17] <Karkus> jesusalva: Okay, I think I understand it better now
[2015/12/21 17:23:18] <jesusalva> I call it worldmap, bacause it doesn't have "levels"
[2015/12/21 17:23:34] <jesusalva> the "levels" are other worldmaps on their own. Like antartica.
[2015/12/21 17:23:42] <jesusalva> And ghostforest.
[2015/12/21 17:24:25] <jesusalva> The "simple" haves 4 worldmaps inside: two are already complete: Antartica and Ghost Forest.
[2015/12/21 17:24:38] <jesusalva> The "complex" haves 9 worldmaps inside it.
[2015/12/21 17:25:22] <Karkus> jesusalva: 4?
[2015/12/21 17:25:23] <jesusalva> It's a worldmap of worldmaps. It was already done once on Matt's World (DOOM islands)
[2015/12/21 17:26:12] <jesusalva> Let's call what we have as a "worldmap" as "levelset". So when you click "play", you don't see the worldmap, you see the "Antartica Levelset"
[2015/12/21 17:26:22] <Karkus> Yes
[2015/12/21 17:26:31] <Karkus> But what are the other 2 level sets?
[2015/12/21 17:26:46] <jesusalva> What I drew would then be the worldmap, with 4 levelsets on it: Antartica, Ghost Forest, Glaciers and the Fortress
[2015/12/21 17:27:18] <jesusalva> Glaciers being a very simple on the being (just to don't leave blank) and the "Fortress" is mostly proof-of-concept
[2015/12/21 17:27:46] <Karkus> jesusalva: Glaciers could probably just be levels from incubator island and the bonus worlds
[2015/12/21 17:28:35] <jesusalva> as brmbrmcar said, we could probably put a cutscene after you pass the gap (which is just to make sure that you completed the other levelsets) to say that the game is not finished yet, but we hope they enjoyed their experience anyway.
[2015/12/21 17:28:42] <jesusalva> Karkus: yes, they could be.
[2015/12/21 17:29:08] <jesusalva> By the way, if Bonus Islands weren't addons, they could be included on that worldmap.
[2015/12/21 17:29:46] <jesusalva> Although I drew something simple. "Go north, go north, go back to antartica and then head east, still by ship/raft/whatever"

[2015/12/21 19:28:18] <Tobbi> Of what?
[2015/12/21 19:28:29] <jesusalva> The above discussion.
[2015/12/21 19:28:54] * jesusalva also wouldn't want to check everything on the logs, so he is cutting to the most "important" parts of it.
[2015/12/21 19:29:05] <Tobbi> jesusalva: Okay, I believe I already skimmed through most of the logs.
[2015/12/21 19:29:22] <Tobbi> I already fetched the most important part which is brmbrmcar getting upset and leaving :P

[2015/12/22 03:59:52] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/22 04:00:00] <Tobbi> snadge: What was your question, anyway?
[2015/12/22 04:04:11] <Tobbi> Probably something regarding the release :P
[2015/12/22 04:07:20] <snadge> yeah.. it was going to be how do i build it on ubuntu 15.10 .. im getting the iconv error after manually installing the other dependencies
[2015/12/22 04:07:25] <snadge> then i saw the repo
[2015/12/22 04:07:56] <snadge> but now the tuxracer package is installed but has nothing in it
[2015/12/22 04:08:18] <snadge> err supertux rather lol
[2015/12/22 04:10:23] <brmbrmcar> The ubuntu one doesn't work.
[2015/12/22 04:10:38] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2015/12/22 04:10:40] <snadge> just discovered that
[2015/12/22 04:10:47] <brmbrmcar> If you have Wine, the windows one works.
[2015/12/22 04:10:48] <snadge> apparently i can manually download libiconv
[2015/12/22 04:11:00] <Tobbi> Are you sure you don't have that already?
[2015/12/22 04:11:05] <snadge> supposedly
[2015/12/22 04:11:15] <snadge> apparently theres an issue with the ubuntu provided one
[2015/12/22 04:11:18] <snadge> and its called something else
[2015/12/22 04:11:18] <Tobbi> Could be this https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/282
[2015/12/22 04:12:10] <snadge> well i could provide more data i suppose and fix it
[2015/12/22 04:12:26] <snadge> apparently i have every other dependency installed.. i just get this error

[2015/12/22 04:16:02] <snadge> that could explain why people install from libiconv from gnu.org
[2015/12/22 04:16:49] <Tobbi> Looks extremely similar to the log provided in https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/282
[2015/12/22 04:17:14] <snadge> thats okay.. it doesn't look like a show stopper
[2015/12/22 04:17:14] <Tobbi> maths22 is currently taking a look at that.
[2015/12/22 04:17:36] <Tobbi> I am afraid I don't know that much about build systems and their quirks.
[2015/12/22 04:17:57] <snadge> the test seems quite explicit.. the comment in it anyway
[2015/12/22 04:18:12] <snadge> that the check will fail on systems that have a definition for double iconv

[2015/12/22 04:22:18] <Tobbi> Hume2: You know: Every function call of get (to get squirrel errors) should be checked by an if statement. otherwise coverity will complain.
[2015/12/22 04:22:52] <Tobbi> Because "not checking return value"
[2015/12/22 04:23:01] <Hume2> Well...

[2015/12/22 04:24:50] <Hume2> Well, were was it? In yeti.cpp or somewhere else did I this mistake?
[2015/12/22 04:24:58] <Tobbi> Hume2: No, yeti.cpp.
[2015/12/22 04:25:02] <Tobbi> Also, it's not a mistake.
[2015/12/22 04:25:08] <Tobbi> It's just something coverity wants :P
[2015/12/22 04:25:36] <snadge> hmm.. why does supertux declare double iconv, when there exists a definition for it as size_t
[2015/12/22 04:25:55] <Hume2> Yes. I still don't get it. I copied that from willowisp.cpp.
[2015/12/22 04:26:21] <Tobbi> Hume2: Okay, so it's wrong in willowisp as well...so something that coverity didn't find.
[2015/12/22 04:26:38] <Hume2> So instead of reader.get(...) it should be if( reader.get(...)) {...}
[2015/12/22 04:27:21] <Tobbi> Hume2: No, if(!reader.get(...)) { log_debug << "Property <whateverprop> not set. Using default..."};
[2015/12/22 04:27:23] <Tobbi> Or something like that.
[2015/12/22 04:27:40] <Hume2> Oh, got it.
[2015/12/22 04:27:51] <Tobbi> Hume2: That's what I did, just to silence coverity.
[2015/12/22 04:28:01] <Tobbi> I am not sure how correct coverity is, but it doesn't matter that muc.
[2015/12/22 04:28:02] <Tobbi> h
[2015/12/22 04:28:06] <Hume2> :D
[2015/12/22 04:29:56] <Hume2> Tobbi: Do I have to mess up with the warning in the log?
[2015/12/22 04:30:10] <Hume2> Or I can just set the default value?
[2015/12/22 04:30:29] <Tobbi> Hume2: just set a default.
[2015/12/22 04:30:38] <Tobbi> Hume2: Coverity just wants it if-checked.
[2015/12/22 04:30:45] <Hume2> Yeah.
[2015/12/22 04:32:21] <Tobbi> snadge: I really don't know. Also, we are the wrong people to ask, none of us know. But maths22 might know the answer...
[2015/12/22 04:32:28] <Tobbi> or rather: Would be able to find out.

[2015/12/22 04:33:45] <snadge> so whilst i have no real experience with iconv, libc, or even cmake.. how hard could it be right? ;)
[2015/12/22 04:34:04] <Tobbi> snadge: Yeah, indeed.
[2015/12/22 04:34:30] <Tobbi> snadge: So, if you can fix it: Pull Request :)
[2015/12/22 04:34:42] <snadge> i also suck at git
[2015/12/22 04:34:55] <brmbrmcar> I HATE GIT!
[2015/12/22 04:34:56] <snadge> but whatever.. i know a little bit about it.. can probably figure it out with a bit of googling
[2015/12/22 04:35:14] <Tobbi> snadge: Then maybe just give us a patch we can apply.
[2015/12/22 04:35:50] <snadge> well i can see from the cmake file.. that it has two seperate paths.. one for if iconv is an external dependency.. and one if its built into libc
[2015/12/22 04:36:13] <snadge> apparently if you download a specific version of iconv from gnu.org .. it will build.. so first i'll try that
[2015/12/22 04:37:03] <snadge> if that works, that will give the clue of how to fix it properly
[2015/12/22 04:37:35] <snadge> i suspect maths22 is already at this point

[2015/12/22 07:34:47] <grumbel_> The addon directory should created by default, so I really don't see the problem
[2015/12/22 07:35:07] <brmbrmcar> It has this file which has for informationyou won'tknow and it needs this complete for addons to work.

[2015/12/22 09:32:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: Why not incorperate the code to run a USB DMX controller also? :p
[2015/12/22 09:32:33] <Tobbi> head8debian: Super*
[2015/12/22 09:32:38] <Tobbi> We call it Super*
[2015/12/22 09:32:43] <Tobbi> Because it incorporates everything.
[2015/12/22 09:33:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: Then if they have DMX lights hooked up they will change to the color of the supertux game. :D
[2015/12/22 09:33:36] <brmbrmcar> I think it is a good background idea.

[2015/12/22 09:34:24] <head8debian> mt: Not sure how well they work, but our church uses probably 5 of them.
[2015/12/22 09:34:44] <head8debian> mt: But not the standard style usb to dmx adapter.

[2015/12/22 09:42:42] <head8debian> I know controlling lights from a computer can be a pain.
[2015/12/22 09:43:05] <mt> I'd probably write a custom controller for the computer
[2015/12/22 09:43:19] <mt> But at the location there's already a controller

[2015/12/22 10:28:26] <mt> for what reason?

[2015/12/22 10:29:01] <mt> I mean right now these libraries are probably built and linked to statically?
[2015/12/22 10:29:38] <mt> oh well, then either make it work with the out-of-box squirrel, or yeah what we do is okay for now.
[2015/12/22 10:30:44] <Tobbi> It does work with the OOB squirrel...
[2015/12/22 10:30:58] <mt> why did we modify it then?

[2015/12/22 10:35:42] <mt> then we can tick that off
[2015/12/22 10:36:20] <Karkus> mt: I have
[2015/12/22 10:36:34] <grumbel> mt: SDL2, glew and Co. are provided by the distribution, all the submodules are static and generally not provided by any distribution
[2015/12/22 10:37:01] <mt> Karkus: then ubuntu xenial will probably follow soon, as he's responsible for that as well
[2015/12/22 10:37:06] <grumbel> having the submodules instead SuperTux also makes it much easier for everybody to quickly fix bugs without worrying about upstream acceptance
[2015/12/22 10:37:38] <grumbel> and with git it can just be merged into upstream at any point when it's good enough
[2015/12/22 10:38:17] <grumbel> wasn't me who started forking all the submodules, but I really like it
[2015/12/22 10:41:20] <Tobbi> grumbel: We should actually merge upstream changes of tinygettext into our clone, shouldn't we?
[2015/12/22 10:43:06] <grumbel> yes, and upstream should merge changes from SuperTux, but that can be done whenever it is needed
[2015/12/22 10:43:32] <Tobbi> ok.
[2015/12/22 10:44:01] <grumbel> If it's done to frequently it kind of bloats the git history
[2015/12/22 10:50:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: What we should also add is climbable ladders... So, ladders are often considered climbable. Normally, you'd first create a ladder and then put a climbable above it. We should merge these steps into one.
[2015/12/22 10:50:55] <Tobbi> So you can simply say: Climbable ladder from y pos a to y pos b

[2015/12/22 10:53:46] <Karkus> Tobbi:Is this an editor thing or a game thing?
[2015/12/22 10:54:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: Editor thing, because those two things should still stay independent... But the editor creates both of the.
[2015/12/22 10:54:20] <Tobbi> m
[2015/12/22 10:54:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/12/22 10:54:48] <Tobbi> I'll create an issue.
[2015/12/22 10:56:00] <Not-e81f> [02flexlay] 07tobbi opened issue 03#55: Create climbable ladders - 13http://git.io/vEnIW
[2015/12/22 10:56:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/issues/54 are you sure this is a flexlay bug?
[2015/12/22 10:57:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: It should be fixed in SuperTux, it can be fixed in Flexlay
[2015/12/22 10:57:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: Actually, let me test something
[2015/12/22 10:57:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: It starts the worldmap via ./supertux2 <worldmap filepath/worldmap.stwm> right?
[2015/12/22 10:57:52] <Tobbi> I remember a bug in SuperTux that sounds like that.
[2015/12/22 10:57:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: It creates a tempfile at /tmp/tmpflexlay.stl and then runs that.
[2015/12/22 10:57:59] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2015/12/22 10:58:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Portability issues...
[2015/12/22 10:58:25] <Tobbi> Portability issues?
[2015/12/22 10:58:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: Windose doesn't have /tmp
[2015/12/22 10:59:06] <Tobbi> Karkus: right...
[2015/12/22 10:59:11] <Tobbi> Karkus: But that's not what I meant.
[2015/12/22 10:59:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: I know
[2015/12/22 10:59:38] <Tobbi> Let me look into that.
[2015/12/22 10:59:42] <Hume2> I think that the ladder should be a tile property.
[2015/12/22 10:59:59] <Karkus> Tobbi: Into what?
[2015/12/22 10:59:59] <Tobbi> Hume2: No, sometimes we want ladders which don't react...
[2015/12/22 11:00:12] <Tobbi> Karkus: Into loading levels when starting a worldmap from supertux.
[2015/12/22 11:00:27] <Hume2> Tobbi: Then put them to a non-solid layer.
[2015/12/22 11:00:29] <Tobbi> I mean: When starting a worldmap like ./supertux2 path/to/levelset/worldmap.stwm
[2015/12/22 11:00:44] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay. First I would test that it works, of course
[2015/12/22 11:00:53] <Tobbi> It doesn't.
[2015/12/22 11:00:56] <Tobbi> Because insecure filename.
[2015/12/22 11:01:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why are they ./level anyway
[2015/12/22 11:01:49] <Karkus> I suppose that's bettwe
[2015/12/22 11:01:51] <Tobbi> Karkus: Because it's in the same directory as the worldmap file.
[2015/12/22 11:01:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah.

[2015/12/22 14:31:27] <Karkus> Hume2: With the mouse
[2015/12/22 14:31:32] <Karkus> Hume2: Can you test it?
[2015/12/22 14:31:37] <Hume2> OK

[2015/12/22 14:38:33] <Hume2> Maybe I should configure it some nice day.

[2015/12/22 18:40:42] <Tobbi> transifex is somewhat...annoying...
[2015/12/22 18:40:44] <sebras> btw, I have never seen supertux until today, but I wanted to contribute an early christmas gift of having a 100% swedish translation at least. :)
[2015/12/22 18:40:45] <Tobbi> it's hard to find stuff.
[2015/12/22 18:41:13] <sebras> Tobbi: indeed. the ui could do with a make over. :-/
[2015/12/22 18:42:12] <Tobbi> Done.
[2015/12/22 18:42:14] <Tobbi> Finally.
[2015/12/22 18:42:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: If we have a mistake/typo in a current translation, can we update it and it will be fixed for anyone else who downloads the langpack?
[2015/12/22 18:42:32] <giby_the_kid> Ok, you're in ;)
[2015/12/22 18:42:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: I think it will...but I'd rather try it out.
[2015/12/22 18:42:56] <sebras> giby_the_kid: Tobbi: thanks.
[2015/12/22 18:43:06] <Karkus> Tobbi: giby said we had a type in the French (?) translation.
[2015/12/22 18:43:26] <giby_the_kid> correcting them ;)
[2015/12/22 18:43:28] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: Is the typo fixed on tx?
[2015/12/22 18:43:48] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: I can assemble a language pack you can try out after I pulled the resources from tx.
[2015/12/22 18:44:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: I will look into moving makepot.sh to py now.
[2015/12/22 18:44:42] <Tobbi> Who uses shell these days...
[2015/12/22 18:46:46] * jesusalva remembered that he is an ubuntu user
[2015/12/22 18:47:39] * jesusalva also remembered that he forgot to update supertux due to low disk space. (and by low I'm not being conservative)
[2015/12/22 18:48:44] <jesusalva> [20:06:21] <Fauve> There is a way to have size of fullscreen but to controll supertux as a window?
[2015/12/22 18:48:44] <jesusalva> Fauve: Try on a terminal: "supertux2 -g 1024x768"
[2015/12/22 18:48:54] <Fauve> Hmm.
[2015/12/22 18:48:57] <Fauve> âkay.
[2015/12/22 18:49:20] <Tobbi> Don't we have "Desktop" as fullscreen resolution?
[2015/12/22 18:50:30] <Fauve> It dosnât work :(
[2015/12/22 18:50:39] <Fauve> No, Tobbi
[2015/12/22 18:51:27] <jesusalva> Then try "supertux2 -w -g 1024x768" or whatever is your resolution now. Assuming "geometrics" command wasn't changed, of course.
[2015/12/22 18:52:10] <jesusalva> Please reduce a little the height/width if you think that the window will be eaten by the menus (or vice-versa). Width for unity, height for Gnome.

[2015/12/22 19:56:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why do I keep getting "Tried spawning Tux in solid matter"?
[2015/12/22 19:56:22] <Karkus> Surely that shouldn't be happening...
[2015/12/22 19:56:46] <Tobbi> Karkus: because our detection code fails when tux is spawning at 0|0
[2015/12/22 19:57:06] <sebras> hm... why are some translations in Lolkat's levels prefixed with "a"?
[2015/12/22 19:57:14] <sebras> should the be in the translations too?
[2015/12/22 19:57:41] <Karkus> Tobbi: Tux shouldn't be spawning at 0|0 anyway!
[2015/12/22 19:57:44] <Tobbi> sebras: Yes, that a has a formatting thing...
[2015/12/22 19:58:01] <Tobbi> sebras: I mean: a means: Format the string in a certain way, give it a yellow colour etc.
[2015/12/22 19:58:11] <sebras> ah.
[2015/12/22 19:58:18] <Tobbi> Unfortunately, we can't change that now...
[2015/12/22 19:58:22] <sebras> Tobbi: the same goes for # I assume..?
[2015/12/22 19:58:27] <Tobbi> sebras: exactly.
[2015/12/22 19:58:37] <sebras> Tobbi: no worries, I just need to know what I should keep. :)
[2015/12/22 19:58:38] <Tobbi> It's a very bad way of formatting strings.
[2015/12/22 19:59:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, what we could do is have a level format version 3, where we get rid of all these annoying things, right?
[2015/12/22 19:59:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: We could.
[2015/12/22 19:59:26] <Karkus> :D
[2015/12/22 19:59:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: Milestone 2 is soo oldschool... :P
[2015/12/22 19:59:47] <Tobbi> Now that it's out.
[2015/12/22 19:59:52] <Tobbi> Milestone 3 is the new hotness.

[2015/12/22 20:01:49] <Karkus> This is actually a problem though...
[2015/12/22 20:01:50] <Tobbi> Actually, we'd have to rename it...
[2015/12/22 20:02:02] <Tobbi> Why the hell did they do it this way.
[2015/12/22 20:02:27] <Karkus> To make it hard for us.
[2015/12/22 20:02:38] <Tobbi> Did they even start from scratch after MS 1?
[2015/12/22 20:02:42] <Tobbi> I don't think so, actually.
[2015/12/22 20:02:51] <Karkus> Pretty much.
[2015/12/22 20:03:01] <Tobbi> But wait...
[2015/12/22 20:03:03] <Karkus> of course, not fully
[2015/12/22 20:03:14] <Tobbi> Karkus: We are not following milestones anyway, according to mt...
[2015/12/22 20:03:19] <Tobbi> So, we could rename it to supertux...
[2015/12/22 20:03:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: True
[2015/12/22 20:03:26] <Tobbi> and just get rid of the numbers.
[2015/12/22 20:03:45] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why aren't we using milestones again?
[2015/12/22 20:03:52] <Tobbi> Karkus: because mt says so.
[2015/12/22 20:03:53] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/22 20:04:01] <Tobbi> How should I know?
[2015/12/22 20:05:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: imo, we should keep them. Even though they are highly illogical
[2015/12/22 20:05:39] <Tobbi> right :D

[2015/12/22 20:06:08] <Tobbi> Yes, that too.
[2015/12/22 20:06:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Also, are the levels put into the executable?
[2015/12/22 20:06:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: no, levels are in data/levels.
[2015/12/22 20:06:37] <Tobbi> And the add-ons of course.
[2015/12/22 20:06:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: But building puts them in the executable.
[2015/12/22 20:06:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: no, it keeps them in the data/ directory, unless you're on Mac OS X...
[2015/12/22 20:07:09] <Tobbi> Where they're part of the app bundle.
[2015/12/22 20:07:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: Where is the data directory?
[2015/12/22 20:07:46] <Tobbi> Karkus: it's a subdirectory of the directory where supertux resides.
[2015/12/22 20:09:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: Which for me is /usr/local/games, but I see no subdirectories.
[2015/12/22 20:09:06] <Tobbi> oh.
[2015/12/22 20:09:08] <Tobbi> damn.

[2015/12/22 20:17:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: I mean: We need to define what function to call when each menu item is selected.
[2015/12/22 20:17:57] <Tobbi> Oh...wait!
[2015/12/22 20:18:00] <Tobbi> We could use scripting.

[2015/12/22 21:45:11] <sebras> ok, almost done with the swedish translations. a few more remaining from treskalle's moob island.
[2015/12/22 21:46:55] <sebras> hopefully one of the other swedish guys will be able to review my translations. I think that's the proces that transifex has.
[2015/12/22 21:47:08] <sebras> this is my first time using it, so I'm hoping I'm doing a good job. now... time to sleep.

[2015/12/23 03:10:48] <mt> Hume2: can you get rid of these merge commits and instead use rebase?

[2015/12/23 03:11:15] <Hume2> mt: It would be even worse.
[2015/12/23 03:11:22] <mt> why that?
[2015/12/23 03:12:16] <mt> merge commits would disappear and all other commits will still keep their chronological order but look like they've been created on top of current master
[2015/12/23 03:12:34] <Hume2> That's it.
[2015/12/23 03:12:42] <mt> what's wrong with that?
[2015/12/23 03:12:53] <Hume2> The github graph would be unuseable.
[2015/12/23 03:13:31] <Hume2> I guess Grumbel did the same because of the same thing.
[2015/12/23 03:13:45] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/graphs/contributors and everything else in graphs/* uses the commit date
[2015/12/23 03:14:17] <mt> for everything else, why would you want to see the commits ordered by date?
[2015/12/23 03:14:25] <Hume2> I mean the log graph.
[2015/12/23 03:14:37] <mt> log graph?
[2015/12/23 03:14:53] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commits/master is broken anyway
[2015/12/23 03:15:11] <Hume2> well, network graph.
[2015/12/23 03:15:16] <Hume2> ... it's called.
[2015/12/23 03:15:31] <mt> what breaks with that one?
[2015/12/23 03:16:36] <Hume2> Its start position is at the top of master and scrolling it to the top of editor is not much reliable and ...
[2015/12/23 03:17:03] <mt> does anyone look at that graph anyway?
[2015/12/23 03:17:12] <Hume2> I do :D
[2015/12/23 03:17:42] <mt> like seriously, what do you actually mean
[2015/12/23 03:18:07] <mt> why do you care if it breaks scrolling forward to see the editor progress?
[2015/12/23 03:18:42] <Hume2> well...
[2015/12/23 03:18:46] <mt> rebasing is what any other sane project does
[2015/12/23 03:20:15] <Hume2> So is it possible to hide the merge commits now?

[2015/12/23 03:23:15] <mt> do you realize how ugly this would look if they wouldn't rebase? http://urandom.eu.org/i/YdvK2HpA.png (merging feature branches at the end of their development is ok, merging master into fix/feature branches isn't)

[2015/12/23 03:26:21] <Hume2> mt: So will I have to fix all the conflicts again?
[2015/12/23 03:26:38] <mt> usually you shouldn't
[2015/12/23 03:27:04] <Hume2> Let's give it a try.
[2015/12/23 03:27:37] <Hume2> So I'm typing: git rebase -i HEAD~96
[2015/12/23 03:28:08] <mt> if you have to do that again, enable rerere (reuse recorded resolution, saving your merge conflict resolutions, https://git-scm.com/2010/03/08/rerere.html)
[2015/12/23 03:28:36] <mt> Hume2: well, to rebase on top of master, just `git rebase master`
[2015/12/23 03:28:49] <mt> I don't know if that already removes merge commits
[2015/12/23 03:29:03] <Not-e81f> [02supertux] 03Success. The Travis CI build passed - 13https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux/builds/98471026
[2015/12/23 03:29:06] <mt> if it doesn't, you have to delete those in an interactive rebase
[2015/12/23 03:29:46] <Hume2> or git rebase master -i?
[2015/12/23 03:29:56] <mt> nope without -i
[2015/12/23 03:30:05] <mt> also it's best to try in a separate branch
[2015/12/23 03:31:16] <mt> git-rebase can be really cool but it also makes it easy to f*** up your git repo/branch
[2015/12/23 03:31:41] <Hume2> So basically I have to rebase first and then hide those merges.
[2015/12/23 03:32:17] @ Quit: alket: Ping timeout: 264 seconds
[2015/12/23 03:33:24] <mt> yeah and then in future also just `git rebase master` instead of `git merge master`
[2015/12/23 03:34:03] <Hume2> OK
[2015/12/23 03:35:00] <Hume2> And when a conflict appears, just type "git rerere", right?
[2015/12/23 03:35:20] <mt> actually, `git rebase master` seems to already flatten out merge commits according to the manual page
[2015/12/23 03:35:36] <mt> git-rerere isn't a command, it's a feature
[2015/12/23 03:36:07] <Hume2> So I type: git rebase master
[2015/12/23 03:36:09] <mt> you have to enable it before you want it to record resolutions and then it will be activated automatically if it's needed
[2015/12/23 03:36:12] <mt> yes

[2015/12/23 03:37:29] <Hume2> conflict, so what? git rerere?
[2015/12/23 03:37:41] <mt> however, if you have any problems `git rebase --abort`
[2015/12/23 03:37:52] <mt> as I said, you can't git rerere.
[2015/12/23 03:38:14] <Hume2> I've already tried it once and it didn't say anything.
[2015/12/23 03:38:23] <Hume2> So it must be a valid command.
[2015/12/23 03:39:00] <Hume2> So I do something like "git rebase master --rerere" ?
[2015/12/23 03:39:15] <mt> nope
[2015/12/23 03:39:23] <mt> can you `git rebase --abort`
[2015/12/23 03:39:28] <Hume2> I did.
[2015/12/23 03:39:28] <mt> then `git config --global rerere.enabled true`

[2015/12/23 10:01:38] <mt> SupertuxUser: tried the nightly builds at https://download.supertuxproject.org/download/ (also see the topic)
[2015/12/23 10:02:33] <mt> bah OBS is broken
[2015/12/23 10:02:36] <Karkus> SupertuxUser: What Linux distro are you using?
[2015/12/23 10:02:59] <SupertuxUser> i saw this page, but i use linux mint. didn't yet found out how to add this repository
[2015/12/23 10:03:15] <mt> don't add it it's broken anyway :P
[2015/12/23 10:03:17] <Poino> mt: Nevermind, there are just 708 levels of Add-Ons

[2015/12/23 10:04:08] <Poino> Karkus: I have OpenSuse, and I cannot find a way too
[2015/12/23 10:04:08] <SupertuxUser> in mints repo (which might be just the ubuntu one) all i find is the version 0.3.4 and 0.3.5~git.. which is really laggy
[2015/12/23 10:04:34] <mt> SupertuxUser: well, we don't provide official builds for Linux, and the distro's package managers are responsible for their packages themselves
[2015/12/23 10:04:44] <SupertuxUser> i do understand that
[2015/12/23 10:05:02] <Karkus> SupertuxUser, Poino: Basically, we're waiting on Ubuntu to update
[2015/12/23 10:05:04] <mt> most Debian and Ubuntu based distros follow the Debian scheme of not updating unless it's a bugfix
[2015/12/23 10:05:17] <mt> at least, for a release cycle
[2015/12/23 10:05:22] <SupertuxUser> i also found that there is a PPA with some supertux version
[2015/12/23 10:05:28] <Karkus> Debian have updated theirs, iirc
[2015/12/23 10:05:32] <SupertuxUser> but not the updated one
[2015/12/23 10:05:42] <mt> These PPAs are unofficial, unsupported, and yeah, out-of-date
[2015/12/23 10:05:57] <mt> Karkus: well, that only affects Debian unstable/sid
[2015/12/23 10:06:12] <Karkus> mt: Oh, yeah
[2015/12/23 10:06:16] <Poino> Karkus: So, there will be no release for Linux until Ubuntu updates?
[2015/12/23 10:06:23] <mt> We have to wait some days/weeks to get in into testing, and then some few years to get it into stable
[2015/12/23 10:06:30] <SupertuxUser> i find it sad that windows users can just download supertux and play and linux users can't
[2015/12/23 10:07:00] <Karkus> SupertuxUser: https://download.supertuxproject.org/download/
[2015/12/23 10:07:15] <mt> Karkus: the nightly builder for Linux is broken, stuck at some older revision
[2015/12/23 10:07:22] <SupertuxUser> well yes, this was linked already karkus. thanks anyway
[2015/12/23 10:07:22] <Karkus> mt: How old?
[2015/12/23 10:07:25] <SupertuxUser> did anyone manage to build 0.4.0 and could point me to a how to?
[2015/12/23 10:07:32] <mt> Ubuntu has updated their package in the xenial repos: http://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/supertux
[2015/12/23 10:07:49] <mt> But the wily repos won't be updated
[2015/12/23 10:08:31] <mt> SupertuxUser: well, I could guide you (if you want also in German, I saw you're connecting from *.t-ipconnect.de)
[2015/12/23 10:08:56] <SupertuxUser> that would be great. english or german both would be fine
[2015/12/23 10:09:17] <mt> so, have you ever used the terminal/command line before?
[2015/12/23 10:09:57] <mt> and - are you using ubuntu trusty or wily?
[2015/12/23 10:10:00] <Poino> Karkus, mt: Congratulations again for Milestone 2, and Merry Christmas!
[2015/12/23 10:10:06] <Karkus> SupertuxUser: I was just pointing out that we do have a way, it appears, however, to be broken
[2015/12/23 10:10:06] <SupertuxUser> yeah, i'm able to follow simple instructions :) but didn't yet build anything with that many dependencies
[2015/12/23 10:10:06] <Poino> 4 everyone :D
[2015/12/23 10:10:23] <SupertuxUser> i already downloaded the source and extracted it aswell
[2015/12/23 10:10:24] <Karkus> Poino: Merry Christmas :D
[2015/12/23 10:10:38] <mt> SupertuxUser: so, what ubuntu version are you using?
[2015/12/23 10:11:09] <mt> err, Linux Mint
[2015/12/23 10:11:11] <SupertuxUser> i use mint 17.3, which is based on ubuntu 14.04 iirc
[2015/12/23 10:12:01] <mt> ok, then you'll probably need some PPAs
[2015/12/23 10:12:13] <SupertuxUser> okay
[2015/12/23 10:12:19] <mt> because ubuntu 14.04's versions are too old
[2015/12/23 10:13:25] <mt> can you `apt-get install cmake build-essential libc++-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libphysfs-dev libglew-dev libopenal-dev libboost-all-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev` (as root)
[2015/12/23 10:13:49] <SupertuxUser> sure
[2015/12/23 10:13:53] <SupertuxUser> will take a few mins to download
[2015/12/23 10:14:12] <SupertuxUser> >223 kB/s 5 min 35 s
[2015/12/23 10:14:28] <head8debian> SupertuxUser: :-) Thats my internet speed.
[2015/12/23 10:14:47] <SupertuxUser> thank you for your help by the way
[2015/12/23 10:14:59] <head8debian> Busy in here... ;)
[2015/12/23 10:15:00] <mt> Hah, until June this year DTAG only provided me ~48kB/s
[2015/12/23 10:15:29] <mt> But got uncapped LTE now
[2015/12/23 10:15:32] <SupertuxUser> i previously installed supertux on three windows computers for kids, and they loved the graphics effects that came with 0.3.9(?)
[2015/12/23 10:15:50] <mt> we jumped from 0.3.5a directly to 0.4.0
[2015/12/23 10:15:54] <head8debian> SupertuxUser: Uhm, 0.3.5a was our last version.
[2015/12/23 10:16:14] <mt> reason: not annoying package managers; see http://semver.org/ for versioning scheme
[2015/12/23 10:16:16] <SupertuxUser> with the halloween map
[2015/12/23 10:16:24] <SupertuxUser> :)
[2015/12/23 10:16:24] <mt> that was 0.3.4 I think
[2015/12/23 10:17:28] @ Quit: irungentoo: Remote host closed the connection
[2015/12/23 10:18:34] <head8debian> Ah, yes, Supertux 0.4.0 is in the Arch repos already... should have known
[2015/12/23 10:19:06] <mt> uh well, 0.4.0 is also in the development releases of ubuntu and debian
[2015/12/23 10:19:33] <head8debian> mt: I figured.
[2015/12/23 10:19:54] <head8debian> mt: I just haven't been on my computer much to look at stuff...
[2015/12/23 10:20:04] <mt> Gentoo updated games-arcade/supertux with an as unstable marked 0.4.0 ebuild: https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/games-arcade/supertux
[2015/12/23 10:20:30] <head8debian> I don't use Gentoo. :)
[2015/12/23 10:21:05] <SupertuxUser> okay, all done mt
[2015/12/23 10:21:39] <mt> ok, then cd to the untar'ed source
[2015/12/23 10:21:53] <SupertuxUser> yes
[2015/12/23 10:22:28] <mt> usually we tend to create a directory for building, often called build/
[2015/12/23 10:22:36] <mt> create one and cd to it
[2015/12/23 10:22:47] <mt> (in the source tree)
[2015/12/23 10:23:06] <SupertuxUser> yeah, done :)
[2015/12/23 10:24:51] <mt> there you can `cmake ..` with your wanted arguments, like `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWARNINGS=ON -DWERROR=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=ON`; if you don't want to mess with system directories, add `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$prefix`, where $prefix is some special install directory in $HOME, or /opt oslt
[2015/12/23 10:25:43] <SupertuxUser>   Could NOT find CURL (missing: CURL_LIBRARY CURL_INCLUDE_DIR)
[2015/12/23 10:25:50] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/23 10:25:53] <mt> `apt-get install libcurl-dev`
[2015/12/23 10:25:59] <SupertuxUser> (after a lot of "found" messages)
[2015/12/23 10:26:01] <SupertuxUser> ok
[2015/12/23 10:26:38] <SupertuxUser> it suggests me three packages instead
[2015/12/23 10:26:43] <SupertuxUser>   libcurl4-openssl-dev 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.5   libcurl4-nss-dev 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.5   libcurl4-gnutls-dev 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.5
[2015/12/23 10:27:05] <mt> what's its exact output?
[2015/12/23 10:27:15] <mt> does it say you have to choose between one of them?
[2015/12/23 10:27:34] <mt> if so, choose whatever crypt backend you'd prefer
[2015/12/23 10:27:47] <SupertuxUser> it says libcurl-dev is a virtual package and i should select one explicitly
[2015/12/23 10:28:16] <SupertuxUser> i will go with the first then
[2015/12/23 10:28:23] <mt> ok then
[2015/12/23 10:29:48] <SupertuxUser> okay, now cmake didn't complain
[2015/12/23 10:29:59] <SupertuxUser> >build files have been written to (build directory)
[2015/12/23 10:30:30] <mt> try `make`, or if you have multiple cores `make -j $(nproc)`
[2015/12/23 10:31:13] <mt> it will take some time
[2015/12/23 10:31:31] <mt> but less than five minutes on a rather recent machine
[2015/12/23 10:31:51] <SupertuxUser> yes, it's running. [ 28%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/supertux2.dir/src/supertux/sector.cpp.o
[2015/12/23 10:33:10] <SupertuxUser> it threw 2 errors at 53%
[2015/12/23 10:33:18] <mt> what errors?
[2015/12/23 10:33:24] <mt> best to pastebin the whole log
[2015/12/23 10:34:39] <SupertuxUser> http://pastebin.com/fHKJYXkD
[2015/12/23 10:36:01] <mt> you can get around that by removing the temp dir, recreating it and running cmake again, but without -DWERROR=ON
[2015/12/23 10:36:11] <SupertuxUser> ok
[2015/12/23 10:36:13] <mt> then make again
[2015/12/23 10:36:27] <SupertuxUser> with temp dir you mean the content of /build?
[2015/12/23 10:36:44] <mt> yes, just remove the entire build directory and recreate it
[2015/12/23 10:38:13] <mt> would you mind giving me the entire cmake command you're using, that might make further help easier
[2015/12/23 10:39:11] <SupertuxUser> i used cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWARNINGS=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
[2015/12/23 10:39:46] <SupertuxUser> build files are written plus CMake Warning:   Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:      BUILD_TESTS
[2015/12/23 10:40:13] <SupertuxUser> should i try to build it with make again?
[2015/12/23 10:40:22] <mt> sure that that's the 0.4.0 source?
[2015/12/23 10:41:01] <SupertuxUser> pretty much
[2015/12/23 10:41:06] <Not-e81f> [02supertux] 07maxteufel commented on issue 03#243: 0.4.0 RELEASE TODO LIST - 13http://git.io/vE4Ok
[2015/12/23 10:41:26] <SupertuxUser> is there a file in the source where i can make sure?
[2015/12/23 10:41:32] <mt> version.cmake
[2015/12/23 10:41:42] <mt> in the root of the source tree
[2015/12/23 10:42:21] <SupertuxUser> okay that does not exist apparently
[2015/12/23 10:43:25] <SupertuxUser> i will download https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/releases/download/v0.4.0/supertux-0.4.0.tar.bz2 (maybe again) to be sure
[2015/12/23 10:44:36] <mt> that tarball should include it, I just checked myself
[2015/12/23 10:44:49] <mt> and on Sunday I checked it quite a few times
[2015/12/23 10:45:05] <SupertuxUser> most likely my fault than :)
[2015/12/23 10:45:25] <SupertuxUser> i dl and try the above steps on it
[2015/12/23 10:46:10] <mt> what you can also make sure is that external/googletest/ exists
[2015/12/23 10:46:16] @ Quit: Poino: Quit: Page closed
[2015/12/23 10:46:30] <SupertuxUser> it does not :)
[2015/12/23 10:46:38] <SupertuxUser> so i tried to build a prior version apparently
[2015/12/23 10:46:41] <mt> then it's an old tarball
[2015/12/23 10:47:13] <mt> since -DBUILD_TESTS (and so googletest) and version.cmake were only introduced with v0.4.0
[2015/12/23 10:48:07] <mt> working on something else but still here; make sure to ping me when you've finished `make`ing
[2015/12/23 10:49:43] <SupertuxUser> i'm on it. now with all cpu cores:)
[2015/12/23 10:51:00] <SupertuxUser> mt: awesome! it works!
[2015/12/23 10:52:52] <mt> ok then, `./test_supertux2` will test that some features work correctly
[2015/12/23 10:53:13] <SupertuxUser> everything RUN OK
[2015/12/23 10:53:21] <SupertuxUser> [----------] Global test environment tear-down [==========] 5 tests from 5 test cases ran. (0 ms total) [  PASSED  ] 5 tests.
[2015/12/23 10:53:43] <mt> if you're done with that, everythings OK, you can continue with `make install` or (`sudo make install`), but be aware that this might delete existing directories, binaries, other files in the prefix you're installing to :)
[2015/12/23 10:55:06] <SupertuxUser> done. i wonder, what does "make install" actually do?
[2015/12/23 10:55:11] <Not-e81f> [02supertux] 07lovejavaee starred 03supertux - 13http://git.io/vE4n9
[2015/12/23 10:56:03] <mt> it copies all the binaries and the data files to the prefix dir
[2015/12/23 10:56:11] <SupertuxUser> okay
[2015/12/23 10:56:41] <SupertuxUser> so if i did not gave it a prefix, it just stays in the build folder?
[2015/12/23 10:56:41] <mt> the binary in $prefix/games/supertux2 (unless you changed the binary location to be $prefix/bin/supertux2), data in $prefix/share/...
[2015/12/23 10:56:54] <mt> not giving a prefix defaults to someplace
[2015/12/23 10:56:57] <mt> I think /usr/local
[2015/12/23 10:57:17] <mt> however, ./supertux2 from your build folder should also be possible
[2015/12/23 10:57:36] <SupertuxUser> yeah, it already worked after make was finished

[2015/12/23 11:05:48] <SupertuxUser> mk: sorry, i have to repeat one question. if i want to install supertux to the default location, is the cmake option '-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$prefix' or am i supposed to replace $prefix with something?

[2015/12/23 11:14:00] <SupertuxUser> everything works except the last "make install" step. some stuff gets copied to /share, but not the executable
[2015/12/23 11:14:29] <mt> $prefix is just a sample bash variable
[2015/12/23 11:14:51] <mt> the default prefix will be set automatically if the option isn't specified
[2015/12/23 11:15:14] <mt> using / as a prefix is a very bad idea fwiw
[2015/12/23 11:16:06] <mt> you can `make uninstall` to remove all the files installed by `make install`
[2015/12/23 11:17:56] <SupertuxUser> that does not work: http://pastebin.com/BCf6d9Vi
[2015/12/23 11:18:10] <mt> did you make clean
[2015/12/23 11:18:32] <mt> uh
[2015/12/23 11:18:38] <mt> seems this got removed oslt
[2015/12/23 11:18:51] <mt> I'm 99.5% sure we had this before

[2015/12/23 11:22:15] <mt> SupertuxUser: make clean cleans built objects
[2015/12/23 11:22:31] <mt> and sometimes some parts of the configuration
[2015/12/23 11:22:42] <SupertuxUser> well, make install DID copy a lot of stuff to /share
[2015/12/23 11:22:50] <SupertuxUser> but nothing i could execute
[2015/12/23 11:22:56] <mt> /games/supertux2
[2015/12/23 11:22:57] <mt> ?
[2015/12/23 11:23:20] <SupertuxUser> ooh
[2015/12/23 11:23:22] <mt> also, I warned you to not run `make install` without knowing what it does >_>
[2015/12/23 11:23:36] <mt> it's very bad to install to plain /
[2015/12/23 11:24:02] <SupertuxUser> i didn't put / anywhere
[2015/12/23 11:24:28] <SupertuxUser> just this $prefix
[2015/12/23 11:24:47] <mt> it's because you probably set -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$prefix when $prefix was = "" so it was equivalent to -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="" which would be equivalent to /
[2015/12/23 11:25:17] <mt> and I made it very clear that $prefix is a variable
[2015/12/23 11:25:54] <Tobbi> Looks like you two are having fun...
[2015/12/23 11:26:08] <SupertuxUser> i'm not that firm as you might noticed. and i didn't blame you:)
[2015/12/23 11:26:49] <mt> sure, but I'm just telling you: next time run a command as root only when you really know what it does ;)
[2015/12/23 11:27:06] <Tobbi> Eigentlich kÃ¶nnt ihr beide deutsch reden.
[2015/12/23 11:27:12] <Tobbi> Macht das ganze vllt. etwas einfacher.
[2015/12/23 11:27:24] <Tobbi> (T-Online-User)
[2015/12/23 11:27:46] <mt> most likely you can remove /games and /share in their entirety, but for that, be really sure to check that they only contain supertux stuff
[2015/12/23 11:28:01] <SupertuxUser> Tobbi, we noticed, but it might be unpolite to non-german people here
[2015/12/23 11:28:25] <Tobbi> SupertuxUser: Okay, you might be right....suit yourself.
[2015/12/23 11:29:26] <SupertuxUser> mt: so i just leave the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX away to get the default location?
[2015/12/23 11:29:38] <SupertuxUser> yeah, /games and /share did not contain anything else
[2015/12/23 11:30:37] <SupertuxUser> i am not sure what location is recommended for a game, tbh
[2015/12/23 11:30:49] <mt> yes, just leave it away for the default location
[2015/12/23 11:31:11] <mt> I usually use a very separate directory, like ~/builds/supertux/
[2015/12/23 11:31:27] <mt> you could just remove that one if you don't need it anymore
[2015/12/23 11:31:32] <SupertuxUser> okay
[2015/12/23 11:31:37] <mt> because it will only contain supertux stuff
[2015/12/23 11:32:19] <mt> the disadvantage of it is that you have to customize your $PATH or always call ~/builds/supertux/
[2015/12/23 11:32:28] <mt> err, ~/builds/supertux/games/supertux2
[2015/12/23 11:33:41] <SupertuxUser> what exactly is customizing my $PATH  good for? to have the executable easier accessible?
[2015/12/23 11:35:04] <mt> then you could just type supertux2 in the terminal

[2015/12/23 11:37:28] <SupertuxUser> i have another question regarding the performance. the game is still a bit stuttering. is there anything i can do about that?

[2015/12/23 11:46:22] <mt> SupertuxUser: you can disable transitions in the options
[2015/12/23 11:46:40] <mt> what hardware are you using?
[2015/12/23 11:47:34] <SupertuxUser> AMD graphics with the fglrx-updates driver
[2015/12/23 11:47:57] <mt> well what CPU, what GPU, ...
[2015/12/23 11:48:38] <SupertuxUser> intel i7 2600k, radeon HD 7950
[2015/12/23 11:48:53] <SupertuxUser> other games run without stutter, some native, some with wine
[2015/12/23 11:48:57] <mt> works fine for me on an intel i5-4670K without any GPU
[2015/12/23 11:49:17] <mt> well, without any other than the Intel HD whatever
[2015/12/23 11:50:26] <mt> are you sure OpenGL rendering is done via your radeon gpu and not software based (mesa)?
[2015/12/23 11:51:48] <mt> -(mesa)
[2015/12/23 11:51:49] <SupertuxUser> that is so specific that i can't say "yes" for sure

[2015/12/23 12:03:24] <SupertuxUser> it is the "screen movement" when i advance in a level. area to the right gets visible, but its not smooth

[2015/12/23 12:44:29] <Karkus> Hume2: "Graveyard Shift" is one which doesn't work, iirc
[2015/12/23 12:44:40] <Hume2> Karkus: What does it display?
[2015/12/23 12:45:12] <Karkus> Hume2: Where the level would usually show, there is just a black screen, I can't see anything.
[2015/12/23 12:45:18] <Karkus> No errors or crash, however
[2015/12/23 12:47:24] <Hume2> That's strange, because I can see the level clearly.
[2015/12/23 12:47:58] <Karkus> Hume2: Hmmm.
[2015/12/23 12:58:54] <Karkus> Hume2: How do you edit an object's properties?

[2015/12/23 12:59:18] <Karkus> Hume2: Ah, thanks
[2015/12/23 12:59:38] <Hume2> It should be right click, but they don't work for some reason.
[2015/12/23 13:00:12] <Hume2> Because SuperTux doesn't proccess them.

[2015/12/23 13:05:56] <Hume2> Karkus: And should it display anything else?

[2015/12/23 13:06:59] <Karkus> Hume2: Ah.
[2015/12/23 13:07:09] <Karkus> Hume2: Looks like you've solved my issue
[2015/12/23 13:07:34] <Karkus> Hume2: I guess "Halloween Party" is the extro?
[2015/12/23 13:07:41] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2015/12/23 13:07:57] <Karkus> Maybe you shouldn't be able to try to edit those
[2015/12/23 13:08:33] <Hume2> No, because you still could edit the init script. Not yet, of course.
[2015/12/23 13:09:15] <Karkus> Hume2: How are you going to do script editing?
[2015/12/23 13:09:53] <Hume2> Well, I haven't done anything with that so far.
[2015/12/23 13:10:13] <DusXMT> I wonder, is there a way I can transfer my post as a translation manager? As I _really_ didn't expect to be put into it oh-so-long-ago when I just asked about the possibility of making a translation. The problem is, I've long lost interest in the project, but abandoning it would probably delete the translation efforts the other members of my team (Slovak) spent, and I wouldn't want that for them.

[2015/12/23 17:40:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, honestly. By now you know enough so that you can lead the project on your own.
[2015/12/23 17:40:05] <Tobbi> You know what a programming language is.
[2015/12/23 17:40:13] <Tobbi> You know a compiler, and you have once seen Alf on TV
[2015/12/23 17:40:22] <Tobbi> -> perfect.
[2015/12/23 17:54:43] <oumph> giby_the_kid, tested with ctrl or q as action key, on antartic or forest world, don't see any difference with or w/o action key pressed when moving and still drifting when changing direction. Doesn't seem to be an effect from desktop environement shorcuts.
[2015/12/23 17:56:25] <giby_the_kid> go on first level, where is it written "run" press action key and try to go up :p
[2015/12/23 17:59:44] <oumph> I just did, successful jump with or without action key pressed
[2015/12/23 18:01:26] <oumph> ctrl (launch one flame, key kept pressed), left, space to jump -> OK
[2015/12/23 18:01:41] <oumph> don't touch ctrl, left, space to jump -> OK
[2015/12/23 18:03:14] <giby_the_kid> ... Tobbi I guess there's a bug

[2015/12/23 20:00:10] <Tobbi> Or maybe you can cope without me.

[2015/12/23 20:00:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's not about going. It's about taking less responsibility.
[2015/12/23 20:00:52] <Tobbi> About feeling that others can make the decisions for the project.
[2015/12/23 20:01:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah
[2015/12/23 20:01:20] <Karkus> Well, in that case we don't need a lead for now
[2015/12/23 20:01:28] <Karkus> We can run it collectively
[2015/12/23 20:01:48] <Tobbi> That seems fine with me as well.
[2015/12/23 20:01:54] <Tobbi> Actually, I'd prefer that.

[2015/12/24 03:19:00] <mt> it does work for us, we run every commit through a CI (https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux) running ubuntu trusty :)
[2015/12/24 03:22:02] <mt> [almost every commit]
[2015/12/24 03:27:07] <snadge> iconv issue
[2015/12/24 03:27:28] <snadge> im running 15.10
[2015/12/24 03:27:50] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/282#issuecomment-166472593
[2015/12/24 03:28:03] <snadge> that one yes
[2015/12/24 03:28:24] <mt> might wanna try to run it in a very sandboxed environment that doesn't know about iconv being installed ;)
[2015/12/24 03:28:52] <snadge> so what i initially did was just build it.. iconv is built into libc
[2015/12/24 03:29:06] <snadge> but then it gives the above error
[2015/12/24 03:29:23] <snadge> so if you manually install it with prefix=/usr .. it then builds just fine
[2015/12/24 03:30:42] <mt> libiconv is built into libc, libiconv isn't built into libc, what now?
[2015/12/24 03:31:51] <mt> if the one built into libc would break it, our CI build shouldn't work as well
[2015/12/24 03:32:36] <snadge> maybe the problem is specific to ubuntu 15.10 .. i dont know
[2015/12/24 03:33:00] <snadge> i do know that /usr/include/iconv.h is different depending on whether libc one is used.. or whether installed manually from gnu.org
[2015/12/24 03:34:21] <mt> it works for me on arch linux, it works for the CI on ubuntu trusty, the ubuntu xenial package seems to build fine, the fedora rawhide package seems to build fine
[2015/12/24 03:34:33] <mt> as well as does the gentoo ebuild
[2015/12/24 03:35:48] <snadge> oh wtf.. i just make install libiconv .. then apt-get install --reinstall libc6-dev
[2015/12/24 03:35:58] <snadge> now it works
[2015/12/24 03:36:17] <snadge> err.. make uninstall libiconv rathe
[2015/12/24 03:36:38] <snadge> so it must have been something screwy with my libc6-dev install
[2015/12/24 03:37:25] <mt> $ sudo debootstrap --variant=minbase wily ./ubuntu-wily-supertux/ http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
[2015/12/24 03:37:27] <mt> let's see
[2015/12/24 03:38:20] <mt> are you using the tarball or the git repo
[2015/12/24 03:39:09] <snadge> tarball for 0.4.0
[2015/12/24 03:39:32] <snadge> im guessing the problem is due to upgrading and having cruft left over
[2015/12/24 03:39:42] <snadge> thats the only way i can explain purging libiconv.. then reinstalling libc-dev fixing it
[2015/12/24 03:39:56] <mt> the https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/releases/download/v0.4.0/supertux-0.4.0.tar.bz2 one, not the github v0.4.0.tar.gz I hope
[2015/12/24 03:40:14] <snadge> yeah im pretty sure it was that one
[2015/12/24 03:43:01] <mt> Welcome to Ubuntu 15.10 (GNU/Linux 4.3.3-1-ARCH x86_64) :D

[2015/12/24 03:49:17] <snadge> i basically added another comment saying.. non issue, at least for ubuntu.. maybe that guys freebsd gripe is related though
[2015/12/24 03:49:52] <mt> yep
[2015/12/24 03:50:02] <mt> I also get an email containing the actual comment, so ...
[2015/12/24 03:50:55] <snadge> happy days.. i basically finished the game the other night for the first time
[2015/12/24 03:50:58] <mt> installing all the dependencies onto an ubuntu minbase install is 470 packages :)
[2015/12/24 03:51:25] <snadge> the end boss is a little underwhelming ;)
[2015/12/24 03:51:33] <mt> oh yay now it needs to prepare configure and what ever all those
[2015/12/24 03:51:35] <snadge> same with the bonus level.. when i eventually found it
[2015/12/24 03:52:24] <mt> suggestions are always welcome
[2015/12/24 03:52:58] <snadge> agdq or sdgq should do a proper speedrun of it
[2015/12/24 03:53:19] <mt> btw if you want to help, you could look into translating on transifex or designing a new forest worldmap (http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=6697)
[2015/12/24 03:55:01] <snadge> i only do english.. but maybe i could have a go at making a map

[2015/12/24 07:53:47] <Poino> That meeting
[2015/12/24 07:54:20] <Tobbi> we need to discuss certain things

[2015/12/24 07:59:55] <Poino> (just joking)
[2015/12/24 08:00:57] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You can certainly lead the project if you want.
[2015/12/24 08:01:11] <Tobbi> I don't care about a drastic decrease in quality any longer.
[2015/12/24 08:01:30] <Poino> why you step out?
[2015/12/24 08:02:02] <brmbrmcar> Oh no!
[2015/12/24 08:02:32] <Tobbi> Poino: Because it was extremely stressful leading this project.
[2015/12/24 08:03:04] <Poino> oh, i see
[2015/12/24 08:03:25] <Tobbi> And I'm not *that* happy with the outcome. There are still quite some bugs...
[2015/12/24 08:03:30] <Tobbi> Things we didn't see...
[2015/12/24 08:05:14] <brmbrmcar> What does leading the project involove?

[2015/12/24 08:33:26] <Hume2> That would make sense, because do you know what high school means?

[2015/12/24 09:52:18] <head8debian> :p
[2015/12/24 09:52:39] <jesusalva> ^_^ Thanks head8debian ^_^
[2015/12/24 09:56:01] <head8debian> jesusalva: You have Christmas break?
[2015/12/24 09:56:05] <head8debian> brake* :p
[2015/12/24 09:56:56] <jesusalva> I am on vacations right now, but many people leave their job ealier on 24th. And 25th is a holiday.
[2015/12/24 09:58:05] <head8debian> jesusalva: Same here.
[2015/12/24 09:58:47] <head8debian> Freedroid 16 is out! :D
[2015/12/24 09:59:35] <jesusalva> Yes, I just didn't found it to download on website. :)

[2015/12/24 10:00:30] <jesusalva> I use ubuntu. :)
[2015/12/24 10:00:31] <mt> so boring
[2015/12/24 10:00:37] <mt> I prefer Grav-Mass: https://stallman.org/grav-mass.html
[2015/12/24 10:01:16] <mt> head8debian: regenerate/update your /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
[2015/12/24 10:01:29] <jesusalva> They are very nice here, mt. It's possibly the only holiday where everybody stops their busy agendas and go meet their families, and swap gifts.
[2015/12/24 10:01:55] <jesusalva> Although some use the day to drink as if there was no tomorrow. I fell sorry for them.
[2015/12/24 10:02:38] <jesusalva> And only on Brazil (I think), it's the last day the country effectively works 'till the carnival. From today/tomorrow util the carnival the workdays are kinda dead.
[2015/12/24 10:03:12] <head8debian> mt: Why?
[2015/12/24 10:03:26] <head8debian> mt: I don't fully understand that.
[2015/12/24 10:03:36] <mt> what? Grav-Mass?
[2015/12/24 10:03:51] <head8debian> mt: No, update my mirrorlist.
[2015/12/24 10:04:04] <head8debian> Why would i do that? ;)
[2015/12/24 10:04:12] <mt> sometimes mirrors stop being maintained/have a slow connection
[2015/12/24 10:04:26] <mt> then you regenerate it and have faster mirrors
[2015/12/24 10:06:01] <mt> I usually take https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/all/, uncomment all close servers/servers in countries I want, and rank it using `rankmirrors -n 0 ...`
[2015/12/24 10:06:46] <mt> oh I leave all https servers commented, unless https is the only supported protocol
[2015/12/24 10:07:19] <mt> you might think why? because it doesn't hide what file you're downloading (can be measured by size) and packages are verified anyway using gpg
[2015/12/24 10:07:49] <head8debian> mt: Ah.

[2015/12/24 11:31:01] <jesusalva> Sorry, the meeting is 15:00 UTC, correct? Topic says "GMT", but we have, like, 26 GMTs.
[2015/12/24 11:31:50] <jesusalva> I am now on GMT -0200. But I'm from GMT -0300. You guys are on GMT+0200 usually. GMT usually haves four digits and an operand on title.
[2015/12/24 11:33:25] <mt> GMT = Greenwich Mean Time
[2015/12/24 11:33:33] <mt> it's basically equivalent to UTC
[2015/12/24 11:33:42] <head8debian> Uhm, when is the meeting?
[2015/12/24 11:33:54] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/12/24 11:33:59] <mt> 15:00 Europe/London
[2015/12/24 11:34:04] <head8debian>  /topic is handy. :D
[2015/12/24 11:34:05] <mt> 16:00 Europe/Berlin
[2015/12/24 11:35:18] <head8debian> 10:00 EST.
[2015/12/24 11:35:34] <mt> jesusalva: you can also write UTC+ or - x
[2015/12/24 11:35:47] <mt> or EST+05:00 if you want lol
[2015/12/24 11:37:16] <jesusalva> I think "GMT" confusing and I'm in favor to write "UTC" instead.
[2015/12/24 11:37:24] <jesusalva> :/
[2015/12/24 11:37:24] <mt> jesusalva: also in the 26 you forgot some +xy:30 and +05:45
[2015/12/24 11:37:37] <mt> the latter is actually used in Nepal
[2015/12/24 11:38:43] <mt> and no, GMT in this case is not confusing
[2015/12/24 11:38:49] <jesusalva> By the way, am I supposed to download all SuperTux repos?
[2015/12/24 11:39:00] <mt> what all repos?
[2015/12/24 11:40:22] * jesusalva marks an agenda event at 15-2=13:00 GMT -0200.
[2015/12/24 11:40:31] <jesusalva> Or 13:00 BRT.
[2015/12/24 11:45:48] <jesusalva> mt: https://github.com/SuperTux haves a dozen of repos there
[2015/12/24 11:45:55] <jesusalva> I want to know which ones I need to download.
[2015/12/24 11:58:16] <mt> to do what?
[2015/12/24 11:58:57] <jesusalva> Um... think as "to play the game fully in brazilian portuguese"
[2015/12/24 11:59:05] <jesusalva> Including addons, on this case.
[2015/12/24 11:59:18] <jesusalva> (And managing to change the game/addons/translations)
[2015/12/24 11:59:20] <mt> `git clone -r https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux.git` for the game
[2015/12/24 11:59:34] <mt> sadly you can't pre-install any add-on or language pack
[2015/12/24 12:01:07] <mt> however, as far as the localization is concerned, the build from the repo will include all translations that were already imported from transifex
[2015/12/24 12:01:31] <mt> language packs can basically be seen as translation updates
[2015/12/24 12:02:48] <jesusalva> Allright then, I'm cloning, but I'll wait #freedroid ends first.

[2015/12/24 14:45:30] <jesusalva> And assuming I didn't got a full sleep cycle, of course. Oversleeping is kinda hard.

[2015/12/24 15:45:54] <Karkus> Hume2: Tobbi and I have planned an IRC meeting for January 9th 2016, just letting you know :D
[2015/12/24 15:47:30] <alket> whats the topic
[2015/12/24 15:49:55] <Hume2> Karkus: Thanks. What will be the topic?
[2015/12/24 15:50:13] <Karkus> Hume2, alket: We haven't decided really.
[2015/12/24 15:50:35] <Hume2> Karkus: And who will lead it?
[2015/12/24 15:51:09] <Karkus> Hume2: Tobbi, probably. If he doesn't want to, you can, or I will. If mt's around, he's welcome to as well.
[2015/12/24 15:51:15] <Karkus> Anyone :D
[2015/12/24 15:51:51] <Hume2> Karkus: We need to decide the topic before it will start, else it will be just a mess.
[2015/12/24 15:52:04] <Karkus> Hume2: Yes, we do
[2015/12/24 15:52:21] <Karkus> Hume2: You should possibly make an issue on GitHub
[2015/12/24 15:52:55] <Hume2> It would be like the Giby'o'meeting then. No offense.
[2015/12/24 15:53:45] <Hume2> Oh, do you know Giby'o'meetings? The discussions about the long-term ST plans.
[2015/12/24 15:53:59] <Hume2> Never again, please.
[2015/12/24 15:54:15] <Karkus> Hume2: When was this?
[2015/12/24 15:54:35] <Karkus> Hume2: I never disagreed, though. The topic must be decided
[2015/12/24 15:54:52] <Hume2> Karkus: it was in 2013.
[2015/12/24 15:55:11] <Karkus> Hume2: What happened?
[2015/12/24 15:55:25] <Hume2> It went off-topic easily.
[2015/12/24 15:55:34] <Hume2> And nothing was decided.
[2015/12/24 15:55:42] <Karkus> Hume2: Yeah, we don't want that.]
[2015/12/24 15:56:30] <Hume2> So when someone will want to talk about something off topic, it would be allowed only in personal chat.
[2015/12/24 15:57:44] <Hume2> Karkus: So may I create a bug saying that there will be a meeting and we don't have a topic yet?
[2015/12/24 15:58:06] <Karkus> Hume2: I think that would be a good idea, yes
[2015/12/24 15:59:01] <Karkus> Hume2: status:needs-discussion :P
[2015/12/24 15:59:10] <Hume2> Of course.

[2015/12/24 16:11:34] <Hume2> Well then. Tobbi will solve it his own way.
[2015/12/24 16:12:02] <Karkus> Hume2: Tobbi doesn't want to be leader anymore, you know.
[2015/12/24 16:12:15] <Hume2> I know.
[2015/12/24 16:12:40] <Hume2> However it will be still a leader for me.
[2015/12/24 16:14:20] <Hume2> Karkus: Any idea what could the topic be?

[2015/12/25 10:38:27] <mt> Maybe.

[2015/12/25 10:38:56] <mt> However I'd move away from this: this is the person that decides everything
[2015/12/25 10:39:34] <mt> everyone contributes as much as they want, and if their contributions are good, they get more privileges on github
[2015/12/25 10:39:41] <Karkus> mt: I agree, but in the end that's the best way to get decisions made. Of course, we are a democracy.
[2015/12/25 10:40:01] <Karkus> So we have votes etc.
[2015/12/25 10:40:15] <Karkus> But a project leader is handy, for a final say.
[2015/12/25 10:46:13] <Hume2> My level, it's so long and laggy, can't play it anymore.
[2015/12/25 10:46:51] <Hume2> Maybe i should make more shorter levels.
[2015/12/25 10:49:00] <Hume2> I got an idea!
[2015/12/25 10:49:35] <Hume2> When someone will be annoying in our meeting, I'll tell him to play my level.
[2015/12/25 10:50:07] <mt> :D
[2015/12/25 10:51:52] <mt> You should actually make more shorter levels, really. Some that could be used for in-between in the new story or for forest world.

[2015/12/25 11:13:21] <Karkus> But maybe difficult :D
[2015/12/25 11:14:20] <mt> I already proposed that.

[2015/12/25 13:00:23] <mt> You asked for enemies
[2015/12/25 13:00:50] <Hume2> I know, but it was here.
[2015/12/25 13:01:10] <mt> what do you think about totem?
[2015/12/25 13:01:12] <Hume2> Totem would fit more to the tropics as well.
[2015/12/25 13:01:36] <Hume2> It could be a boss, each segment could have its special ability.
[2015/12/25 13:01:56] <mt> because we're already there, what about the shop?
[2015/12/25 13:02:05] <mt> I think it's actually a cool idea
[2015/12/25 13:02:11] <Hume2> I think so.
[2015/12/25 13:02:13] <jesusalva> I like it too
[2015/12/25 13:02:18] <mt> maybe it could be a lighthouse
[2015/12/25 13:02:23] <Hume2> But what to sell here?
[2015/12/25 13:02:27] <mt> on every island there's a lighthouse
[2015/12/25 13:02:41] <mt> Hume2: for now, power-ups, I guess
[2015/12/25 13:03:11] @ Quit: lumidify: Ping timeout: 260 seconds
[2015/12/25 13:03:26] <mt> possible other ideas: transportable blocks or lights that can be used all over the worldmap
[2015/12/25 13:03:27] <Hume2> Russian style: 4 goods in a shop and a shop assistent that explains why they can't have more.
[2015/12/25 13:04:09] <mt> having a level unlocked for some coins would be an idea as well
[2015/12/25 13:04:28] <Hume2> +1
[2015/12/25 13:04:54] @ alket joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/25 13:05:07] <Hume2> There could be also special powerups just for the shop.
[2015/12/25 13:05:16] <mt> +1
[2015/12/25 13:05:35] <mt> why not limit air- and earth-flower to the shop
[2015/12/25 13:05:44] <mt> they're currently not used anyway, are they?
[2015/12/25 13:06:25] <Hume2> That's what I thought too.
[2015/12/25 13:06:47] <Karkus> mt: To be honest, coins are too easy to get.
[2015/12/25 13:06:50] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/25 13:07:03] <Hume2> Maybe increase the coin limit?
[2015/12/25 13:07:07] <Karkus> You can play level 1 lots of times and have tonnes of coins
[2015/12/25 13:07:17] <Hume2> That's true.
[2015/12/25 13:07:47] <Hume2> The easy levels shouldn't contain so many coins.
[2015/12/25 13:07:59] <mt> possibly idea for a new shop-only powerup: some freezing liquid that doesn't affect Tux because he lives on Antarctica but immediately freezes enemies when Tux collides with them
[2015/12/25 13:08:34] <Hume2> Yes, but with limited number of usages.
[2015/12/25 13:08:55] <mt> That and possibly hide some only one-time-collectable items in secret areas that can be exchanged for more valuable powerups
[2015/12/25 13:10:27] <Hume2> That sounds interrasting.

[2015/12/25 13:22:26] <Hume2> I didn't edited that now, strange.
[2015/12/25 13:22:43] <mt> yes it's because I force-pushed the wiki repository
[2015/12/25 13:22:58] <mt> I sometimes squash and reword some commits in there
[2015/12/25 13:23:12] <giby> +v for a milestone 3 document, we need... to wait for the meeting, no'
[2015/12/25 13:23:31] <mt> (yes the wiki is a git repo: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux.wiki.git)
[2015/12/25 13:23:59] <giby> wrong address
[2015/12/25 13:25:03] <Hume2> I think that the most of the Milestone 3 design document will be scrapped during the meeting.
[2015/12/25 13:26:01] <mt> yeah
[2015/12/25 13:26:08] <mt> by updating I basically mean writing from scratch what's been discussed after the 0.4.0 release
[2015/12/25 13:26:15] <mt> in regards to gameplay
[2015/12/25 13:28:52] <Hume2> For bosses it's usual that they have two different attacks. That's why the totem seems me a bit weird.
[2015/12/25 13:29:37] <mt> yeah
[2015/12/25 13:30:00] <mt> however, each segment having a special ability is a nice idea
[2015/12/25 13:30:56] <Hume2> It is, maybe only the topmost segment should use its ability.
[2015/12/25 13:31:16] <Hume2> Or the topmost two segments?

[2015/12/25 15:33:07] <kneekoo> giby: if you'll approve my join request I'll be able to start working on the translation :)
[2015/12/25 15:33:27] <giby> Hi kneekoo
[2015/12/25 15:33:33] <giby> which language?
[2015/12/25 15:33:54] <kneekoo> hello
[2015/12/25 15:33:56] <kneekoo> Romanian
[2015/12/25 15:34:23] <kneekoo> I would like to know if 0.4.0 fully supports UTF-8
[2015/12/25 15:35:07] <kneekoo> because this was a problem when I translated my local copy (the shame...) and some characters weren't rendered

[2015/12/25 16:05:25] <mt> the fonts are simply png files
[2015/12/25 16:05:56] <mt> and they don't include all UTF-8 chars
[2015/12/25 16:06:18] <mt> we've had some discussion about using ttf fonts

[2015/12/25 16:23:00] <mt> kneekoo: what character is missing?
[2015/12/25 16:23:14] <kneekoo> well, it's a mixed bag
[2015/12/25 16:23:29] <kneekoo> the menu and the game use different ways to render fonts
[2015/12/25 16:23:57] <mt> oh
[2015/12/25 16:24:06] <kneekoo> because in the game I could use some characters, while in the menu I couldn't
[2015/12/25 16:24:13] <mt> that's not supposed to happen I guess
[2015/12/25 16:24:22] <kneekoo> ÈÈÄ are the culprits, anyway
[2015/12/25 16:24:30] <mt> can you show screenshots, something to reproduce,...?
[2015/12/25 16:24:51] <kneekoo> the letters are simply missing
[2015/12/25 16:25:03] <kneekoo> it's just an empty space instead of those letters
[2015/12/25 16:25:47] <kneekoo> I first noticed the issue when I saw the existing translation - which was the reason I started translating the game myself
[2015/12/25 16:26:02] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/fonts/andale10.stf
[2015/12/25 16:26:09] <mt> these characters are listed there
[2015/12/25 16:26:24] <mt> can you open an issue on github?
[2015/12/25 16:26:38] <kneekoo> oh, wait... I think I'm confusing this issue for Pingus
[2015/12/25 16:26:52] <kneekoo> last year I translated SuperTux and Pingus for my nephew
[2015/12/25 16:27:09] <kneekoo> and I had some issues while translating
[2015/12/25 16:27:10] <mt> oh well, no problem, everyone makes mistakes :)
[2015/12/25 16:27:49] <kneekoo> anyway, v0.4.0 stands at 20% in Romanian so I have plenty of work to do
[2015/12/25 16:28:08] <maths22> mt: See http://hg.icculus.org/icculus/physfs/file/1709a0f75ee3/src/platform_unix.c#l296
[2015/12/25 16:28:14] <kneekoo> I just need my application approved
[2015/12/25 16:28:19] <maths22> I'll switch to the physfs version

[2015/12/25 16:30:05] <mt> "Even if that's not the general convention for a given platform. " great reasoning 10/10
[2015/12/25 16:30:41] <kneekoo> what's the easiest way to test my translation on Linux? (existing build vs compilation)
[2015/12/25 16:31:22] <mt> sadly I don't know how to build a language pack, that would work with an existing build
[2015/12/25 16:31:44] <kneekoo> that's my problem
[2015/12/25 16:31:53] <kneekoo> is there a package for 0.4.0
[2015/12/25 16:31:54] <kneekoo> ?
[2015/12/25 16:32:02] <kneekoo> it would be easier than compiling
[2015/12/25 16:32:14] <mt> you could download your .po files and place them in the appropriate data/ directories and then compile
[2015/12/25 16:32:41] <Karkus> maths22: Are Linux nightlies working yet by the way?
[2015/12/25 16:33:04] <kneekoo> I was hoping for an easier way - I don't like compiling :(
[2015/12/25 16:33:20] <mt> no, they seem to be stuck at that old commit
[2015/12/25 16:33:38] <mt> kneekoo: what OS/distro are you using?
[2015/12/25 16:34:11] <kneekoo> Mint MATE 17.3, 32-bit - based on Ubuntu 14.04
[2015/12/25 16:34:56] <mt> well you could try mixing in packages from Ubuntu 16.04, but you should only do that if you know what you're doing
[2015/12/25 16:36:29] <maths22> Karkus: not yet
[2015/12/25 16:36:33] <kneekoo> so 0.4.0 needs newer libraries, unavailable in 14.04?
[2015/12/25 16:37:28] <maths22> mt: I agree it's silly.  Oddly, the author is the same as the physfs author, and he didn't make that change there
[2015/12/25 16:40:21] <giby> Sorry kneekoo I was away
[2015/12/25 16:40:38] <kneekoo> man, I got scared... I thought something happened with the Romanian locale on Transifex because I can no longer select it from the "Join team" list

[2015/12/25 16:45:37] <kneekoo> yes, that's really weird
[2015/12/25 16:47:34] <giby> Yes... unless Tobbi used that in a script to make language pack...

[2015/12/26 07:52:44] <mt> hi Karkus
[2015/12/26 07:52:57] <Karkus> Hello mt
[2015/12/26 07:52:57] <red_bot> Karkus, you have notes! [Dec-26 06:07] <mt> hey, tried to add support for modifying a pushbutton's script in flexlay, but didn't get it to work for some reason (http://sprunge.us/fdKY)
[2015/12/26 07:53:56] <Karkus> mt: We have PushButtons in SuperTux?
[2015/12/26 07:54:03] <mt> yes
[2015/12/26 07:54:08] <Karkus> mt: Oh
[2015/12/26 07:54:17] <Karkus> I know what you mean.
[2015/12/26 07:54:42] <mt> see data/levels/test_old/pushbutton.stl
[2015/12/26 07:54:59] <mt> what did you expect as PushButtons?
[2015/12/26 07:55:45] <mt> Also I guess there should be MultiLineStringProperty(StringProperty)
[2015/12/26 07:56:01] <mt> since you can't enter newlines in the one-line thing
[2015/12/26 07:56:13] <mt> (for scripts)
[2015/12/26 07:59:36] <Karkus> mt: Scripts are going to have their own property. It will open a new tab, and have syntax highlighting
[2015/12/26 07:59:49] <mt> :)
[2015/12/26 07:59:54] <mt> ok then
[2015/12/26 08:00:01] <Karkus> mt: But multiline string properties may be useful anyway
[2015/12/26 08:00:09] <mt> however I still have no idea why this doesn't
[2015/12/26 08:00:11] <mt> work
[2015/12/26 08:00:18] <Karkus> mt: Wah
[2015/12/26 08:00:20] <mt> what does work is that a pushbutton appears in the object list
[2015/12/26 08:00:22] <Karkus> huh?
[2015/12/26 08:00:29] <Karkus> Yeah
[2015/12/26 08:00:33] <mt> however when you edit a pushbutton it won't show the script property
[2015/12/26 08:00:41] <mt> is that somewhere else?
[2015/12/26 08:01:15] <Karkus> mt: No, what you've done seems fine. I need to fix properties
[2015/12/26 08:01:32] <Karkus> mt: By "edit a pushbutton" what do you mean?
[2015/12/26 08:01:57] <mt> select one existing in a level, ctrl-click "Show properties" (or display whatever)
[2015/12/26 08:02:08] <mt> and in the right toolbar
[2015/12/26 08:03:00] <Karkus> mt: I am getting the same thing. Let me take a look.
[2015/12/26 08:14:20] <mt> what for was cherrybomb created?
[2015/12/26 08:15:11] <Karkus> mt: I have no idea
[2015/12/26 08:15:20] <mt> I didn't ask you
[2015/12/26 08:15:45] <mt> this is probably a question some of the previous devs can answer
[2015/12/26 08:15:51] * mt looks at the nicklist
[2015/12/26 08:17:30] <mt> there are quite a few of them here
[2015/12/26 08:20:22] <brmbrmcar> A lot of old images have no spritefiles.
[2015/12/26 08:21:48] <Karkus> mt: Your __init__ isn't even running...
[2015/12/26 08:22:51] <mt> as in, it never gets called?

[2015/12/26 08:23:26] <mt> brmbrmcar: that's because they're probably not implemented as badguys
[2015/12/26 08:24:09] <Karkus> mt: Your identifier "pushbutton" is interfering with something else.
[2015/12/26 08:24:27] <Karkus> mt: Either change it, or find what's also called "pushbutton"
[2015/12/26 08:24:43] <Karkus> I changed it, and it all works, I think.
[2015/12/26 08:25:41] <Karkus> mt: Found it.
[2015/12/26 08:25:59] <mt> what's it for, the identifier? looking at the above and below code I thought it was what's in the level files (the '(pushbutton ...)')
[2015/12/26 08:26:11] <Karkus> Let me make a commit, and then you can pull and try yours
[2015/12/26 08:26:19] <Karkus> mt: And for identification
[2015/12/26 08:26:58] <mt> do I have to remove the objects.csv entry?

[2015/12/26 08:27:38] <Karkus> mt: I've done it.
[2015/12/26 08:28:00] <Karkus> objects.csv should be renamed to badguys.csv, actually.
[2015/12/26 08:28:22] <Karkus> But there are other things in there, so I'll leave it

[2015/12/26 08:38:47] <alket> mt: how do I check
[2015/12/26 08:39:04] <mt> you don't know in which level that issue is?

[2015/12/26 08:41:54] <mt> probably some mistake when creating the secret area there
[2015/12/26 08:42:05] <alket> there is a secret area ? xD
[2015/12/26 08:43:01] <mt> enter the secret area and the issue will be resolved :D
[2015/12/26 08:43:15] <mt> there's even a visible hint

[2015/12/26 08:43:31] <alket> yeah xD
[2015/12/26 08:44:31] <alket> why do I need the coins for ?
[2015/12/26 08:45:45] <mt> e.g. iirc 25 coins will be removed when you get spawned to a checkpoint
[2015/12/26 08:46:07] <mt> when you have less than 100 it will spawn you at the beginning of the level iirc
[2015/12/26 08:46:21] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/26 08:46:33] <Tobbi> No, less than 25, I think
[2015/12/26 08:46:50] <alket> I have 2000 coins so im good :)
[2015/12/26 08:47:16] <Tobbi> pah! I have 9999 coins.

[2015/12/26 10:09:40] <mt> he's upgrading irssi and sasl has to be updated from a script to the native implementation

[2015/12/26 10:10:34] <head8debian> mt: Im figuring out how to enable sasl, since im finding no info on how to.
[2015/12/26 10:10:52] <head8debian> Even irssi's help is not helping much.

[2015/12/26 10:55:13] <mt> also https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/278
[2015/12/26 10:56:00] <Karkus> mt: Yeah, I've looked. It's not everything we need though.
[2015/12/26 10:58:15] <head8debian> Im alive. :D
[2015/12/26 10:58:16] <Karkus> mt: Also, you know this idea with the items to get to the next worldmap, will all the levels be visible in the same worldmap, or will you have to use an item, then go into that worldmap?
[2015/12/26 10:58:23] <head8debian> Now lets try this thing.
[2015/12/26 11:02:00] <mt> Karkus: I imagine it's possible to make levels appear using scripting
[2015/12/26 11:02:00] <Karkus> mt: Would the worldmaps have to be "stuck together" or will they remain in seperate files?
[2015/12/26 11:02:00] <Karkus> *separate
[2015/12/26 11:02:00] <mt> I don't know
[2015/12/26 11:02:00] <mt> if we want them to be visible at the same time, they'll have to be in one file
[2015/12/26 11:02:00] <Karkus> mt: Do we want that?
[2015/12/26 11:02:00] <mt> however making transitions and spawning to another worldmap is possible
[2015/12/26 11:02:01] <mt> Karkus: tbh I'd prefer it being visible all at the same time
[2015/12/26 11:02:01] <mt> one big worldmap
[2015/12/26 11:02:08] <Karkus> mt: I don't think that would be very good.
[2015/12/26 11:02:14] <head8debian> Phew, rbot doesn't register it.
[2015/12/26 11:02:14] <head8debian> red_bot: *
[2015/12/26 11:02:14] <head8debian> Id liek red-bot to not hav ops.
[2015/12/26 11:02:52] <mt> Karkus: reasons?
[2015/12/26 11:03:09] <mt> head8debian: register a separate account, ask for a bot cloak in #freenode
[2015/12/26 11:03:33] <head8debian> mt: Why?
[2015/12/26 11:03:50] <mt> so it doesn't get ops from ChanServ
[2015/12/26 11:03:56] <Karkus> mt: It'd be a mess to edit, I guess
[2015/12/26 11:04:31] <mt> Karkus: with a working editor probably not
[2015/12/26 11:04:31] <Karkus> And we want to keep the different worlds separate right?
[2015/12/26 11:04:44] <brmbrmcar>  /mode -o red_bot would be temporary.

[2015/12/26 11:08:11] <mt> Karkus: layers would be only needed for making levels/castles appear/disappear
[2015/12/26 11:08:20] <mt> so that's another problem
[2015/12/26 11:09:01] <Karkus> mt: world1's worldmap has 14 layers

[2015/12/26 11:09:38] <Hume2> Agreed!
[2015/12/26 11:09:48] <Karkus> mt: I admit that when I first entered the cave I was very impressed.
[2015/12/26 11:10:17] <mt> same here, but I first saw that in LMH's addon
[2015/12/26 11:10:32] <mt> long before it was added to the actual code
[2015/12/26 11:11:00] <Hume2> The cave is a bit strange though.
[2015/12/26 11:11:24] <Hume2> Why does it have paralax background? Is it large enough?
[2015/12/26 11:12:45] <mt> ask LMH
[2015/12/26 11:14:12] <Karkus> Hume2: I would say it's pretty large
[2015/12/26 11:14:44] <Hume2> Have you ever been in a cave?
[2015/12/26 11:17:15] <Hume2> That's the LMH's disco style. It's not my favourite, but that's all I can do with that.

[2015/12/26 11:26:09] <Hume2> Karkus: Yes, but it still wasn't as big as the LMH's one.
[2015/12/26 11:26:29] <Karkus> Hume2: We don't need to change it, though.
[2015/12/26 11:26:38] <Hume2> Karkus: I know :D
[2015/12/26 11:27:10] <mt> Karkus: layers in flexlay are a bit user unfriendly
[2015/12/26 11:29:13] <Hume2> Karkus: Do you know that penguins are tetrachromatic, so they see four light channels?
[2015/12/26 11:29:14] <mt> and how to edit backgrounds, ... that stuff

[2015/12/26 11:30:32] <mt> which bigger problems?
[2015/12/26 11:33:07] <Karkus> mt: You can only edit one sector, Tobgle Road gives errors, You can't add layers, zooming out slows down the editor on laptops/slow computers

[2015/12/26 12:58:40] <grumbel> As for the error, it's caused by a string not being quoted, the new parser is a bit more pedantic then the old when it comes to incorrect syntax
[2015/12/26 13:01:08] <Hume2> Once I wondered why it says that the string is "=". It was because I wrote (name = <value>).

[2015/12/26 13:58:57] <maths22> Do we have a proper filesystem library we use?
[2015/12/26 13:59:50] <giby> Today someone requested a translation team for English from UK...
[2015/12/26 13:59:54] <mt> physfs?
[2015/12/26 14:00:31] <maths22> mt: Physfs does not provide a helpful way to list only files from a single logical directory, or to copy a file
[2015/12/26 14:00:57] <mt> then not, unless boost provides some functions for that?
[2015/12/26 14:01:14] <Karkus> giby: I know... you denied it, right?
[2015/12/26 14:01:23] <mt> giby: reject all country-specific languages, please
[2015/12/26 14:01:39] <Karkus> mt: No...
[2015/12/26 14:02:01] <Karkus> mt: Some are very different aren't they?
[2015/12/26 14:02:07] <mt> giby: we don't need fr_FR, fr_CA, de_AT, de_CH, de_DE, en_XY
[2015/12/26 14:02:31] <Karkus> mt: Not to that extent.
[2015/12/26 14:02:39] <maths22> mt: We currently don't depend on the boost file-system library, but we could.  It probably only affects Windows builds (I would need to update the dependencies zips)
[2015/12/26 14:03:05] <mt> maths22: I don't see a problem in doing that
[2015/12/26 14:04:01] <mt> Karkus: well, for de_* there are some differences in choosing words, but probably anyone who speaks German well would understand that
[2015/12/26 14:04:47] <maths22> mt: Great!  I needed a way to move the contents of the old pref dir into the new one.
[2015/12/26 14:05:01] <Karkus> mt: What about Portuguese (Brazil vs Portugal)
[2015/12/26 14:05:39] * jesusalva awakes
[2015/12/26 14:05:42] <mt> not sure about that, I think the right person for that question is jesusalva
[2015/12/26 14:06:01] <head8debian> Hello jesusalva.
[2015/12/26 14:06:44] * jesusalva was correcting DroidBotAI patch for FDRPG and doing fixes so it could feature for 0.17 release later on.
[2015/12/26 14:08:09] @ Quit: Hume2: Quit: Page closed
[2015/12/26 14:09:15] <jesusalva> Karkus, mt: Usually, for some reason, Brazilian Portuguese tends to be more translated than Portugal Portuguese, and that's why pt_PT usually plays with pt_BR... However the difference isn't misc.
[2015/12/26 14:10:01] <jesusalva> Some item names are named differently in Brazil and in Portugal and may cause confusion. Besides, Brazil uses some characters that Portugal doesn't.
[2015/12/26 14:12:02] <jesusalva> Although with the new writting-agreement these changes dimmed, they still exists.
[2015/12/26 14:12:18] <mt> I think that 'more translated' is because Brazil has 200 mio. inhabitans, Portugal just has 10 mio.
[2015/12/26 14:12:43] <jesusalva> mt: Or maybe Brazilians play more games...
[2015/12/26 14:14:09] <mt> would a Brazilian understand Portugal Portuguese?
[2015/12/26 14:14:35] <mt> Because then it would make much more sense to translate to Portugal Portuguese
[2015/12/26 14:15:14] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/26 14:15:39] <giby> I reject most of them... especially en_BE
[2015/12/26 14:16:13] <mt> en_BE? that should be en_GB if you're talking about british english
[2015/12/26 14:16:34] <mt> Belgian English :D
[2015/12/26 14:17:54] <mt> wtf this actually exists?
[2015/12/26 14:18:52] <head8debian> :p
[2015/12/26 14:19:46] <mt> also if possible: nl_* -> nl; hu_HU -> hu; ru_RU -> ru
[2015/12/26 14:20:02] <mt> ca_ES -> ca
[2015/12/26 14:21:35] <mt> oh and remove the 0% langs
[2015/12/26 14:21:58] <jesusalva> mt: Hardly.
[2015/12/26 14:22:12] <jesusalva> I cannot translate to pt_PT anyways.
[2015/12/26 14:22:29] <jesusalva> If I did, it would be all messed up and pt_PT players would complain.
[2015/12/26 14:22:38] <mt> didn't think there's so much difference
[2015/12/26 14:22:56] <jesusalva> There are semantic differences, and those are very important.
[2015/12/26 14:42:09] <mt> ~note Tobbi what should we do about the Sie in the German translation? http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Translation#Notes_for_Translators wants translators to use the personal form, if one exists
[2015/12/26 14:42:09] <red_bot> okay, mt
[2015/12/26 14:49:07] <jesusalva> mt: The "Du"?
[2015/12/26 14:49:35] <mt> Yes, apparently Wuzzy changed everything to "Sie", "Du" however is more personal
[2015/12/26 14:50:24] <jesusalva> Yes, however, "Du" is like first-name in Japanese. It's something you don't go using for everyone you met. :/
[2015/12/26 14:51:34] <mt> I'd say "Du" is appropriate in a game
[2015/12/26 14:51:46] <Karkus> When is the word "you" even used?
[2015/12/26 14:52:23] <mt> Karkus: well it's also indirect as your/yours which is also different in German
[2015/12/26 14:52:35] <mt> and they are mostly used in Infoboxes
[2015/12/26 14:52:43] <Karkus> mt: Ah, I se
[2015/12/26 14:52:45] <Karkus> *see

[2015/12/27 14:48:42] <polyphagia> i poked around and i love that scheme is used
[2015/12/27 14:48:53] <mt> If you're done with that and interested in helping us, http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=6697
[2015/12/27 14:48:56] <polyphagia> although is it home rolled?
[2015/12/27 14:49:00] <polyphagia> why not use guile?
[2015/12/27 14:49:18] <polyphagia> oh neat!
[2015/12/27 14:49:28] <mt> well, scheme, we've only written scripts for upgrading the level format using that
[2015/12/27 14:49:35] <mt> in the game we're using simple s-expressions
[2015/12/27 14:49:57] <mt> I'm not sure guile is supposed to parse that, I thought it was a scheme interpreter
[2015/12/27 14:51:06] <mt> You can also always have a look at https://github.com/supertux/supertux/issues to see what could need fixing/writing new code :)
[2015/12/27 14:51:31] <mt> oh and https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Milestone-3-Design-Document is what we plan for the next releases
[2015/12/27 14:53:15] <mt> // insert more spam about how great it is to contribute to SuperTux here
[2015/12/27 14:54:07] <polyphagia> oh i see yeah that makes sense
[2015/12/27 14:54:18] <polyphagia> alright thanks
[2015/12/27 14:54:21] <polyphagia> will do
[2015/12/27 14:54:42] <polyphagia> >The shopkeeper (e.g. an old walrus with a beard)
[2015/12/27 14:54:45] <polyphagia> lol that was specific
[2015/12/27 14:55:18] <mt> that old walrus with a beard was taken from the old Milestone 3 Design Document

[2015/12/27 14:56:37] <alket> Where is Penny ?
[2015/12/27 14:56:46] * jesusalva adverts: Even wondered how to be on the credits of your favorite game feels like? Join #supertux on irc.freenode.net!
[2015/12/27 14:57:04] <mt> alket: didn't it play the cutscene for you?
[2015/12/27 14:57:12] <polyphagia> also i don't think the game has enough puns mt
[2015/12/27 14:57:19] <alket> mt: no
[2015/12/27 14:57:37] <alket> what cutscene ? the one which Penny gets captured ?
[2015/12/27 14:57:43] <mt> normally it would play an extro saying penny isn't there
[2015/12/27 14:59:30] <alket> :S
[2015/12/27 14:59:34] <jesusalva> mt: Does the 0.4.0 contains SDL2?
[2015/12/27 15:00:18] <mt> yes

[2015/12/27 15:23:47] <mt> Spamtifico!
[2015/12/27 15:25:06] <jesusalva> Can't you program Not-e81f to be a little less verbose? So it only says one change you done per request instead of all changes. :/

[2015/12/27 15:25:39] <mt> Owners on github could turn off labels entirely
[2015/12/27 15:25:44] <alket> mt: its a very good level, quite challenging
[2015/12/27 15:25:55] <mt> but because github calls the hook per label changed
[2015/12/27 15:26:03] <mt> we can't say, post this but not this
[2015/12/27 15:26:16] <mt> well we could but Not-e81f is hosted by someone else
[2015/12/27 15:26:59] <jesusalva> It's said to be hosted by 198.199.82.216
[2015/12/27 15:27:28] * jesusalva thinks that Not-e81f could use a cloack.
[2015/12/27 15:27:33] <mt> http://n.tkte.ch/
[2015/12/27 15:28:03] <mt> jesusalva: I think the developer who also hosts that instance doesn't want to/have time to add SASL
[2015/12/27 15:28:48] <mt> also, as one instance might spawn more than 5 irc bots and freenode's maximum logged in per account at a time is 5, that'll be a problem
[2015/12/27 15:29:26] <jesusalva> Oh. Thanks for the info. :)
[2015/12/27 15:29:27] <mt> I think I could set up my bot to announce commits instead of notifico
[2015/12/27 15:29:56] <jesusalva> #freedroid uses their own bot-302 and bot-329. One announces commits and pull requests, the other announce builds.
[2015/12/27 15:30:46] <mt> is that their own or the github one
[2015/12/27 15:31:28] <jesusalva> I think it's their own. (bot-329@freedroid.osuosl.org)
[2015/12/27 15:32:09] <jesusalva> It announces commits and request changes (bot-302) and when a build is started/completed (bot-329)
[2015/12/27 15:32:18] <mt> can you ask them what they're using?
[2015/12/27 15:32:46] <jesusalva> Hm. matthiaskrgr or fluzz should know...
[2015/12/27 15:33:21] <Hume2> I made a levelset for annoying people, or you can just play it when you get bored: https://www.dropbox.com/s/wwsjjeys94ts4as/tt_reborn1.zip?dl=0

[2015/12/28 08:45:42] <mt> I already posted an issue about the security issue in flexlay
[2015/12/28 08:45:54] <mt> since the RedHat team wanted me to request publicly anyway
[2015/12/28 08:46:48] <mt> http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/12/28/3
[2015/12/28 08:47:26] <Karkus> This is also an issue in https://github.com/flexlay/flexlay/
[2015/12/28 08:47:55] <mt> That would have to be requested separately since it's a different codebase
[2015/12/28 08:48:03] <Karkus> Maybe another issue should be posted there for anyone who tries to get flexlay there?
[2015/12/28 08:48:20] <mt> can be done when we have the CVE

[2015/12/28 10:18:55] <jesusalva> hi mantas-baltix
[2015/12/28 10:18:57] <mt> Hello mantas-baltix
[2015/12/28 10:19:07] <mt> Karkus: well it depends on that PR
[2015/12/28 10:20:56] <mantas-baltix> I with my son wanna finish Lithuanian Supertux translation (currently Supertux is only half translated to Lithuanian)
[2015/12/28 10:21:06] <mantas-baltix> please add me to Lithuanian Supertux translators team.
[2015/12/28 10:21:18] <mt> Karkus can do that, I think
[2015/12/28 10:21:32] <mantas-baltix> I think, that my Transifex profile shows enough info about my skills:  https://transifex.com/user/profile/mantas/
[2015/12/28 10:21:57] <mantas-baltix> If it's not enough - see https://translations.launchpad.net/~mantas/ and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MantasKriauÄiÅ«nas
[2015/12/28 10:22:27] <mt> We pretty much don't need any references about your skills
[2015/12/28 10:22:50] <mt> Have you already applied to join at https://www.transifex.com/arctic-games/supertux/language/lt/
[2015/12/28 10:23:55] <mantas-baltix> Yes, I'm mantas ;)
[2015/12/28 10:24:02] <mt> Also, is it possible that you provided a PPA with supertux builds some years ago?
[2015/12/28 10:24:17] <mt> Your name sounds somewhat not that strange in affiliation with SuperTux
[2015/12/28 10:25:18] <mt> mantas-baltix: well I'm not manager on Transifex so you have to wait for one (Karkus, Tobbi, giby and LMH are)
[2015/12/28 10:26:06] <maths22> mt: http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Amaths22%3ASuperTux&package=supertux2
[2015/12/28 10:26:09] <mantas-baltix> Maybe, I don't remmember all my contributions to free software ;) I just remmember, that I'm providing PPA of Supertuxkart packages for Ubuntu
[2015/12/28 10:26:25] <mt> or that, yeah
[2015/12/28 10:27:08] <mt> that 27.1 in the rpm is what, maths22?
[2015/12/28 10:27:24] <mantas-baltix> Karkus: could you add me to Lithuanian Supertux translators team.
[2015/12/28 10:29:03] <mt> maths22: also, even though arch already has packages in their repos, the PKGBUILD is still trying to download the git repo
[2015/12/28 10:29:43] <mt> you'd have to change that to the tarball and remove the git-submodule call
[2015/12/28 10:30:20] <maths22> mt: I know-I'll work on that soon
[2015/12/28 10:30:35] <maths22> The 27.1 reflects the version of the OBS config repo
[2015/12/28 10:31:03] <mt> can I link to that download page?
[2015/12/28 10:31:19] <mt> in the release announcement I mean
[2015/12/28 10:31:41] <mt> then you'd probably need a separate OBS package for the git builds
[2015/12/28 10:33:06] <maths22> mt: Sure-I was already planning on a separate OBS package
[2015/12/28 10:37:33] <mt> Also posted a Tweet
[2015/12/28 10:39:06] <Karkus> mantas-baltix: What is your username?
[2015/12/28 10:39:24] <mt> They said it's "mantas"
[2015/12/28 10:39:29] <mantas-baltix> my username is mantas ;)
[2015/12/28 10:39:42] <Karkus> Thanks
[2015/12/28 10:41:52] <mt> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10798250
[2015/12/28 10:48:25] <Karkus> mantas-baltix: Do you know how do add you? I can't figure out how to do it.
[2015/12/28 10:49:11] <Karkus> mantas-baltix: I don't even know if I'm able to.
[2015/12/28 10:49:36] <mt> Well Transifex shows you're a team manager so you should be able to
[2015/12/28 10:49:44] <mt> However, I don't know how to
[2015/12/28 10:49:57] <mantas-baltix> Karkus: I don't know if you are able to add me to Lithuanian team ;)
[2015/12/28 10:51:03] <Karkus> mantas-baltix: It says Tobbi is the manager https://www.transifex.com/arctic-games/teams/95/lt/
[2015/12/28 10:51:06] <mt> As in team manager I mean manager of the SuperTux project
[2015/12/28 10:51:11] <mantas-baltix>  Team Manager is tobbi and Coordinator  is  giby (Benjamin Leduc) according to https://www.transifex.com/arctic-games/teams/95/lt/
[2015/12/28 10:51:29] <Karkus> mantas-baltix: So maybe I can't :/
[2015/12/28 10:51:44] <mt> https://www.transifex.com/arctic-games/supertux/
[2015/12/28 10:51:49] <mantas-baltix> Maybe, I don't know :(
[2015/12/28 10:51:59] <mt> "Maintainers:" "Karkus7.., ..."
[2015/12/28 10:52:41] <Karkus> mt: Yes, but I'm not a team manager of any of the languages
[2015/12/28 10:52:57] <mt> Huh, can't a maintainer do that?
[2015/12/28 10:53:14] <mt> Well, you might however be able to update the strings?
[2015/12/28 10:54:23] <Karkus> mt: I think I am able do that... I don't know how though.
[2015/12/28 10:54:37] <Karkus> I forgot I was even added to this
[2015/12/28 10:54:57] <Karkus> mt: Sign up with GitHub, I'll add you as a maintainer.
[2015/12/28 10:55:13] <mt> I'm "mteufel" there
[2015/12/28 10:55:21] <mt> No need to sign up
[2015/12/28 10:55:38] <jesusalva> A maintainer can
[2015/12/28 10:56:02] <Karkus> jesusalva: How?
[2015/12/28 10:56:11] <mt> jesusalva: what did the #freedroid people say about their bots
[2015/12/28 10:56:32] <Karkus> mt: I've invited you.
[2015/12/28 10:56:33] <jesusalva> Go to the Lithuan Language, "Manage Team", and search for the application (or add him via the menu)
[2015/12/28 10:57:21] <jesusalva> mt: Nothing yet. Not sure if matthiaskrgr or fluzz were online since. However ahuillet is on and as he is the oldest of them, he may be able to answer...
[2015/12/28 10:57:24] <jesusalva> I'll check.

[2015/12/28 10:58:57] <jesusalva> One is to add a colaborator (so you can add mantas-baltix directly), and another is to manage staff (so you can accept his request)
[2015/12/28 10:59:56] <Karkus> jesusalva: Which blue bar?
[2015/12/28 11:00:43] <jesusalva> On the screen top, there is "Languages > Lithuan" (or something like that)
[2015/12/28 11:00:50] <jesusalva> below the project info
[2015/12/28 11:01:05] <jesusalva> right below it. It's greyish but still blue.
[2015/12/28 11:02:29] <Karkus> jesusalva: This is what I see

[2015/12/28 11:03:45] <jesusalva> Hm. If you can add a member, you should see "View Members" and see if you can accept the request.
[2015/12/28 11:04:27] <jesusalva> If you can't for whatever error, then transifex doesn't allows you to. (Which can be kinda odd...)
[2015/12/28 11:04:36] <Karkus> jesusalva: I can't see any way to accept a request.
[2015/12/28 11:04:47] <jesusalva> Then Transifex is not allowing you to.
[2015/12/28 11:05:57] <mantas-baltix> So, button "View members" doesn't help me ? :(
[2015/12/28 11:06:54] <Karkus> ~note Tobbi Please could you add user "mantas" to Lithuanian translation team on Transifex? https://www.transifex.com/arctic-games/supertux/language/lt/ https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/mantas/
[2015/12/28 11:06:54] <red_bot> okies, Karkus
[2015/12/28 11:07:10] <Karkus> mantas-baltix: I can see the members, but can't add new ones.
[2015/12/28 11:08:04] <Karkus> mantas-baltix: We'll get you added as soon as possible.
[2015/12/28 11:08:38] <jesusalva> To add you, you must see like this: https://imgur.com/UJrFH9z
[2015/12/28 11:09:09] <Karkus> jesusalva: I can't see that. Clearly I cannot add him.

[2015/12/28 11:10:11] * jesusalva was so noob by then that he didn't even knew how to apply. :)
[2015/12/28 11:13:53] <mt> This is so stupid
[2015/12/28 11:14:04] <mt> So I can remove a language but can't add a translator

[2015/12/29 10:41:53] <mt> Tobbi: could you explain me how to update langpacks?
[2015/12/29 10:41:59] <mt> (see #308)
[2015/12/29 10:42:15] <Tobbi> mt: Check-in language packs using git, then update the nfo file.
[2015/12/29 10:42:15] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2015/12/29 10:42:23] <Tobbi> mt: Also, there's a script that does that.
[2015/12/29 10:42:29] <Tobbi> aka, package them, I mean.
[2015/12/29 10:42:33] <mt> well, how do I update the *.pos
[2015/12/29 10:42:37] <mt> and then build one
[2015/12/29 10:42:56] <Tobbi> mt: For that you need the tx client.
[2015/12/29 10:43:00] <Tobbi> Then do tx pull.
[2015/12/29 10:43:11] <mt> I have that installed
[2015/12/29 10:43:21] <mt> tx pull in the addons clone or in the supertux clone
[2015/12/29 10:43:53] <Tobbi> mt: In a different directorz.
[2015/12/29 10:43:56] <Tobbi> *directory
[2015/12/29 10:44:18] <Tobbi> Then run this script https://github.com/SuperTux/addons/blob/master/make_lang_addon.sh with the path to the langpacks.
[2015/12/29 10:44:28] <Tobbi> Make sure it's an absolute path, not a relative one.
[2015/12/29 10:44:57] <Tobbi> If you want, you can rewrite that dreaded script in Python.
[2015/12/29 10:45:09] <Tobbi> Would be much easier to maintain.
[2015/12/29 10:48:01] <Tobbi> Actually, makepot.sh should be rewritten in python as well.
[2015/12/29 10:48:13] <Tobbi> If you're up to it.
[2015/12/29 10:48:33] <Tobbi> Anyway, after the langpacks are created, there are zip files in the langpacks dir.
[2015/12/29 10:48:43] <Tobbi> And these need to replace the ones in the add-ons repository.
[2015/12/29 10:48:56] <Tobbi> Also, there's an NFO index file that contains the new items.
[2015/12/29 10:49:56] <Tobbi> mt: ^^
[2015/12/29 10:50:06] <Tobbi> mt: Also, is tx pull slow for you as well or is it just me?
[2015/12/29 10:50:08] <mt> index_to_change.nfo?
[2015/12/29 10:50:16] <mt> yes tx pull is quite slow
[2015/12/29 10:50:25] <Tobbi> mt: Yes, exactly.
[2015/12/29 10:50:41] <mt> the nfo should replace what file in the addons repo?
[2015/12/29 10:50:56] <Tobbi> mt: Not replace, just copy the contents and replace the relevant contents in...eeh let me check.
[2015/12/29 10:51:33] <Tobbi> mt: https://github.com/SuperTux/addons/blob/master/index-0_4_0.nfo#L144
[2015/12/29 10:51:47] <Tobbi> That's the beginning of that block.
[2015/12/29 10:51:54] <mt> I'll push to a separate branch for you to check :)
[2015/12/29 10:51:59] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2015/12/29 10:52:10] <Tobbi> mt: If you can, please rewrite that script to be more user-friendly and stuff...
[2015/12/29 10:53:45] <mt> Once I have time, yes
[2015/12/29 10:54:02] <Tobbi> ok

[2015/12/29 10:57:04] <Tobbi> mt: Also, why would a grabbed object not be a MovingObject* ? We're assert'ing exactly that in https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/src/object/player.cpp#L1001
[2015/12/29 10:57:18] <mt> I don't know
[2015/12/29 10:57:22] <mt> the assert() there failed
[2015/12/29 10:57:38] <Tobbi> mt: You just updated one MD5...? Did you intend to do that?
[2015/12/29 10:57:51] <Tobbi> Looks like this worked then.
[2015/12/29 10:57:53] <mt> a few lines above there's also a debug log thing saying 'grabbed non-MovingObject'
[2015/12/29 10:58:08] <mt> langpacks/langpack-fr.zip:
[2015/12/29 10:58:11] <mt> Binary file not shown
[2015/12/29 10:58:38] <Tobbi> mt: Yes, seems fine.
[2015/12/29 10:58:41] <mt> oh and how would I go about updating the translations in the supertux repo?
[2015/12/29 10:58:53] <Tobbi> mt: That has to be done manually...just copy the files over.
[2015/12/29 10:59:31] <Tobbi> the relevant ones I mean.

[2015/12/29 11:00:48] <Tobbi> mt: Did you check that the langpack works? It takes some time to get updated by github...
[2015/12/29 11:01:04] <Tobbi> ~ 5 minutes or so.
[2015/12/29 11:01:16] <mt> no I just hope it works if we get complaints I'll just revert the commit
[2015/12/29 11:01:40] <Tobbi> It currently tells me "MD5 checksums differ"
[2015/12/29 11:01:47] <Tobbi> but it might resolve itself after some time.

[2015/12/29 12:00:10] <mt> I think someone actually let GitHub take down the entire Bukkit repo (or something else Minecraft related) due to a GPL violation
[2015/12/29 12:00:28] <Hume2> hmmm...
[2015/12/29 12:00:34] <Hume2> That is not good.
[2015/12/29 12:00:46] <Hume2> Was it commerical?
[2015/12/29 12:01:36] <mt> Bukkit? I dunno why. I just read that somewhere at some point.
[2015/12/29 12:02:30] <mt> It was due to some silly GPL rule. (No I'm not that much GPL-friend, I'd prefer MIT/Apache/NCSA/zlib/...)
[2015/12/29 12:02:39] <Hume2> It's important, because the commerical violation is usually punnished more.
[2015/12/29 12:03:28] <mt> Well it was without a court order, just a DMCA (any private person can send GitHub one if their copyright was violated)
[2015/12/29 12:04:51] <Karkus> Do we know who the authors are? Can't we contact them by the email they provide in the level "contact"?
[2015/12/29 12:05:02] <mt> I don't think there's an email
[2015/12/29 12:05:15] <Hume2> Most of them are anonymous.

[2015/12/29 12:06:55] <mt> Hume2: I don't think so
[2015/12/29 12:07:14] <mt> at least in Germany, unless you specifically transfer the right you're always copyright holder
[2015/12/29 12:07:26] <mt> you just gave the publisher permission to publish
[2015/12/29 12:07:41] <mt> which is a license, which can be revoked again
[2015/12/29 12:08:04] <mt> (unless you said it's permanent)
[2015/12/29 12:08:07] <Hume2> Yes, but when the author is anonymous?
[2015/12/29 12:08:42] <mt> That doesn't make a difference
[2015/12/29 12:09:00] <Hume2> How do I get who is the author then in that case?
[2015/12/29 12:09:10] <mt> You'd ask the publisher who will tell you it was created by someone else but they don't know who
[2015/12/29 12:10:01] <Hume2> And he has to tell it, right?

[2015/12/29 12:11:39] <mt> why would they have to? (and what if they don't know)
[2015/12/29 12:11:45] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2015/12/29 12:12:02] <mt> well if they don't know they can't give you permission
[2015/12/29 12:12:09] <mt> simple as that
[2015/12/29 12:12:46] <Hume2> Now I see how much the copyright laws differ.
[2015/12/29 12:13:23] <Hume2> In Czech Republic it is like I said.
[2015/12/29 12:13:34] <mt> It might be, of course, different if you allow the publisher to sub-license something
[2015/12/29 12:14:09] <Karkus> Hume2: GitHub is not in the Czech Republic, is it?
[2015/12/29 12:14:17] <Hume2> Karkus: I know.
[2015/12/29 12:14:38] <Hume2> Maybe I shouldn't apply that anymore.

[2015/12/29 12:40:34] <Karkus> mt: It's not always appropriate, and not customizable. It could be reimplemented as a property of climbable objects?

[2015/12/29 12:41:31] <Hume2> I'll look whether I can do that.
[2015/12/29 12:41:52] <Tobbi> That sounds interesting.
[2015/12/29 12:42:11] <Tobbi> Should also be easy.
[2015/12/29 12:42:15] <mt> You're already working with the editor, Hume2, would you mind someone else trying this to get familiar with SuperTux code?
[2015/12/29 12:42:41] <Hume2> mt: I'll be glad if someone could work on it too.
[2015/12/29 12:42:49] <mt> I'll try to do it then
[2015/12/29 12:42:49] <Hume2> Good thought.
[2015/12/29 12:43:14] <Karkus> mt: Okay. I left the message code commented, too

[2015/12/29 12:44:10] @ Wuzzy joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/29 12:44:26] <Tobbi> Problem is: Once resyncing translations, this will remove the "Up we go..." message from transifex.
[2015/12/29 12:44:30] <Tobbi> If we ever want to reuse it.
[2015/12/29 12:45:06] <Hume2> I think that this is here just because the prior lack of sprite.
[2015/12/29 12:45:27] <Hume2> It used to use the skid action instead of climbing.
[2015/12/29 12:45:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: After mt is done, we can add it back in specifically for the purpose of "A Fork in the road"
[2015/12/29 12:45:47] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2015/12/29 12:46:05] <Karkus> mt: The message needs to be translatable, however. Not sure how easy that is
[2015/12/29 12:47:01] <mt> I think it's just _(string)
[2015/12/29 12:47:33] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2015/12/29 12:47:48] <Hume2> Don't forget to include "util/gettext.hpp"
[2015/12/29 12:48:09] <mt> that's already there because bad Karkus forget to remove that when it's not needed
[2015/12/29 12:48:09] <Hume2> Else it won't work.
[2015/12/29 12:48:15] <mt> s/forget/forgot/
[2015/12/29 12:48:15] <red_bot> mt meant: "that's already there because bad Karkus forgot to remove that when it's not needed"
[2015/12/29 12:48:48] <Karkus> mt: I had this idea for messages already. You just got there first :P
[2015/12/29 12:49:32] <Karkus> mt: But, yeah, I should have removed it.
[2015/12/29 12:49:58] <Karkus> mt: Forgive my recklessness
[2015/12/29 12:50:07] <Tobbi> We could have messages for everything.

[2015/12/29 13:02:52] <Hume2> Anyone wants to explain something on SuperTux code?
[2015/12/29 13:05:24] <Tobbi> I can do it: So, there was an if statement once. It was all alone, because it only contained a null check. It was an outcast among all the other pieces of programming code because what it did was deemed worthless by them.
[2015/12/29 13:06:24] <Tobbi> But once, there was this REALLY weird bug in the code...All the other pieces of code were like " I am not responsible." and suddenly they found the value in that little null check that was left alone previously.
[2015/12/29 13:06:29] <Tobbi> And all lived happy ever after.
[2015/12/29 13:06:32] <Tobbi> The end.

[2015/12/29 14:38:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am currently trying to change the Tilemap property of SecretAreaTrigger from string to enum.
[2015/12/29 14:38:26] <Tobbi> But getting the tilemaps from the level is quite hard there.
[2015/12/29 14:39:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: In the editor?
[2015/12/29 14:39:41] <Tobbi> Karkus: yes.
[2015/12/29 14:41:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: Use flexlay/editor_map.py  get_tilemap_layers() ?
[2015/12/29 14:41:14] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/12/29 14:41:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: Is it a static method? Because currently, property.py doesn't know anything about the GUI
[2015/12/29 14:41:38] <Tobbi> That's the problem.
[2015/12/29 14:42:05] <Tobbi> I'd rather not pass a editor_map instance for each property constructor.
[2015/12/29 14:42:27] <Tobbi> Oh, we have Workspace.current
[2015/12/29 14:42:32] <Tobbi> maybe there's something there.
[2015/12/29 14:43:42] <Tobbi> hrm, no.
[2015/12/29 14:44:16] <Tobbi> I'll probably put it there.

[2015/12/29 15:41:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes
[2015/12/29 15:41:10] <Karkus> It's in a branch
[2015/12/29 15:41:11] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, let me check.
[2015/12/29 15:41:17] <Karkus> text-editor
[2015/12/29 15:41:22] <Karkus> or something
[2015/12/29 15:41:41] <Karkus> Currently, you run it separately from the editor.
[2015/12/29 15:41:54] <Tobbi> Ah!
[2015/12/29 15:42:33] <Tobbi> I protected "develop" by the way.
[2015/12/29 15:42:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: From force-push?
[2015/12/29 15:42:46] <Tobbi> Karkus: yes.
[2015/12/29 15:42:50] <Tobbi> It's better I think.
[2015/12/29 15:43:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, I thought I'd already done that...
[2015/12/29 15:43:21] <Tobbi> Oh wait.
[2015/12/29 15:43:24] <Tobbi> I believe you did :D
[2015/12/29 15:43:30] <Tobbi> Github|s gui is weird...
[2015/12/29 15:47:25] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/12/29 15:47:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: Interesting. Very colourful.
[2015/12/29 15:47:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's nothing really, I was messing around, testing.
[2015/12/29 15:48:03] <Tobbi> Yeah, but still...Could be useful.
[2015/12/29 15:48:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Some time, I'd like to add it into the editor, but currently I'm working on a settings dialogue
[2015/12/29 15:48:46] <Tobbi> Alright.

[2015/12/29 16:17:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't see images..
[2015/12/29 16:17:44] <Tobbi> Did you forget to add those?
[2015/12/29 16:17:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh. Maybe :P
[2015/12/29 16:18:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I did. Just a minute.
[2015/12/29 16:18:28] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/12/29 16:18:44] <Karkus> The images aren't very good, to be honest
[2015/12/29 16:18:49] <Tobbi> No problem.
[2015/12/29 16:18:58] <Tobbi> We can probably find better ones on openclipart.org
[2015/12/29 16:19:15] <Tobbi> They have a wide variety of icons available.
[2015/12/29 16:20:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's where I got them from, but I put no effort in to find good ones, nor to edit them

[2015/12/29 16:25:09] <Tobbi> or should I say converted...

[2015/12/29 16:25:41] <polyphagia> you can stream it with mplayer or vlc
[2015/12/29 16:25:45] <polyphagia> i don't really render videos in my browser

[2015/12/29 16:26:32] <polyphagia> it was a lot of fun
[2015/12/29 16:26:56] <Tobbi> We can probably integrate it into the editor.
[2015/12/29 16:26:56] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/29 16:27:03] <polyphagia> yeah i wrote it all in python
[2015/12/29 16:27:06] <Karkus> polyphagia: It converts it from an image?
[2015/12/29 16:27:07] <polyphagia> in fact half of it is on my github already
[2015/12/29 16:27:09] <polyphagia> yeah
[2015/12/29 16:27:21] <polyphagia> i have two scripts, one that separates the tiles and makes a map
[2015/12/29 16:27:26] <polyphagia> and another to convert that map into the level
[2015/12/29 16:27:29] <polyphagia> with a translation file

[2015/12/29 21:57:24] <mark_otaris> Two bug reports in a few hours of testing, not bad!
[2015/12/29 22:19:55] <polyphagia> maybe it cracked from the sudden rise in temperature mark_otaris ?
[2015/12/29 22:20:10] <mark_otaris> hm?
[2015/12/29 22:21:19] <Tobbi> What have we done?
[2015/12/29 22:21:28] <Tobbi> People are suddenly getting interested in the game.

[2015/12/29 23:00:31] <polyphagia> i didn't look how to implement it by running but it i just tested it by replacing the walk sprite
[2015/12/29 23:00:35] <polyphagia> the extra frames really look nice
[2015/12/29 23:00:47] <polyphagia> i hope it can be modified for the larger tux

[2015/12/30 13:59:29] <Tobbi> The language request.
[2015/12/30 14:01:59] <Tobbi> I even added AlisaP to it.
[2015/12/30 14:02:35] <Tobbi> We'll see how it turns out.

[2015/12/30 14:09:38] <polyphagia> haha no just saying hi
[2015/12/30 14:09:47] <mt> We could make a rule: any language that's not at 50% translated after 3 months will be deleted

[2015/12/30 14:10:03] <polyphagia> what's going on with the font though?
[2015/12/30 14:10:12] <polyphagia> do we have enough characters for all these languages? how is that handled?
[2015/12/30 14:10:16] <Tobbi> mt: I believe we should just keep it. Don't waste translator's work.

[2015/12/30 14:10:49] <polyphagia> i think we should
[2015/12/30 14:10:56] <polyphagia> Tobbi: the issue is on github, one moment

[2015/12/30 14:11:29] <polyphagia> and then of course the move to ttf is linked

[2015/12/30 14:11:35] <Tobbi> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/130 is also.
[2015/12/30 14:11:50] <Tobbi> mt: All the fonts would need to be traced.
[2015/12/30 14:11:52] <polyphagia> so yeah i agree that it should be moved, but somebody would need to manually convert the font
[2015/12/30 14:11:56] <polyphagia> OR
[2015/12/30 14:12:03] <polyphagia> we could find an alternative font that looks similar
[2015/12/30 14:12:09] <polyphagia> that is under a free license
[2015/12/30 14:12:10] <giby> Hi... polyphagia Someone proposed a latin translation few years ago, I think we said it was pointless...

[2015/12/30 14:13:45] <Tobbi> Hmm. there's google's font library as well.
[2015/12/30 14:13:48] <Tobbi> also openfontlibrary.org

[2015/12/30 14:13:56] <polyphagia> Tobbi: https://github.com/neutraltone/awesome-stock-resources#fonts
[2015/12/30 14:13:59] <Tobbi> Hey.
[2015/12/30 14:14:00] <mt> polyphagia: are these German characters even listed in https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/images/engine/fonts/white-big.png
[2015/12/30 14:14:02] <Tobbi> That's a good one.
[2015/12/30 14:14:08] <giby> So, for coding, so far, we use a png font, Latin/cyrilic/greek were hand drawn (Some would need some improve) asian are made with a script
[2015/12/30 14:14:18] <polyphagia> yeah Tobbi we can add the shadow
[2015/12/30 14:14:22] <polyphagia> and it would look very similar
[2015/12/30 14:14:33] <Tobbi> What does everyone else think?
[2015/12/30 14:14:40] <mt> I don't actually think tracing would be a problem
[2015/12/30 14:14:42] <polyphagia> we could really just replace all of those separate bitmap fonts with one TTF
[2015/12/30 14:14:45] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/12/30 14:14:47] <polyphagia> and we could fallback characters if need be
[2015/12/30 14:14:51] <Tobbi> mt: Can you do it? :P
[2015/12/30 14:14:55] <Not-e81f> [02supertux] 07LMH0013 commented on issue 03#303: Glitch/Bug in "A fork in the road". - 13http://git.io/vExzs
[2015/12/30 14:14:57] <mt> The fonts we use have a very clean contouring
[2015/12/30 14:15:01] <polyphagia> except for the languages that are totally different
[2015/12/30 14:15:08] <polyphagia> we could try to find some more apt fonts
[2015/12/30 14:15:13] <polyphagia> but i say TTF is a good idea
[2015/12/30 14:15:30] <polyphagia> and yeah if somebody could trace the current one, it would be ideal
[2015/12/30 14:15:32] <mt> I'd first switch to TTF and use some font, then try to trace the current ones
[2015/12/30 14:15:37] <polyphagia> yeah
[2015/12/30 14:15:40] <Tobbi> hmm, alright.
[2015/12/30 14:15:48] <Tobbi> So, who's willing to give it a try.
[2015/12/30 14:15:48] <polyphagia> i'd say switch to TTF first, find a suitable replacement font
[2015/12/30 14:15:56] <polyphagia> and wait for somebody to trace it
[2015/12/30 14:15:57] <Tobbi> haha, I'm getting to like this project manager role.
[2015/12/30 14:16:01] <polyphagia> whenever it's traced we could implement it
[2015/12/30 14:16:10] <Tobbi> "Yeah, you do this, you do that" :D
[2015/12/30 14:16:11] <polyphagia> but we don't have to wait on it
[2015/12/30 14:16:13] <polyphagia> ALSO
[2015/12/30 14:16:18] <mt> we'd have to look if potrace can be used for automating the tracing task
[2015/12/30 14:16:25] <polyphagia> if we used TTF, the traced font could include as many characters as we want. ascii or not
[2015/12/30 14:16:41] <polyphagia> which is great
[2015/12/30 14:16:55] <polyphagia> we could likely merge a few fonts
[2015/12/30 14:16:55] <giby> polyphagia, I traced some of the glyph... Which german letter is missing?
[2015/12/30 14:17:01] <polyphagia> i'm not sure giby check the github issue
[2015/12/30 14:17:09] <Tobbi> giby: How do you trace the font, once again?
[2015/12/30 14:17:27] <polyphagia> pretty sure you can use inkscape and export as SVG, and fontforge can import SVG
[2015/12/30 14:17:33] <polyphagia> but maybe not
[2015/12/30 14:17:39] <giby> Actually, I gave up in creating a TTF from those letter...
[2015/12/30 14:17:47] <polyphagia> it's just a long and boring task lol
[2015/12/30 14:17:52] <polyphagia> it'd be nice to automate it
[2015/12/30 14:18:04] <Tobbi> Okay, long and boring tasks are perfect for head8debian
[2015/12/30 14:18:07] <giby> Latin, greek and cyrillic where drawn with gimp
[2015/12/30 14:18:28] <Tobbi> Hello, head8debian, we got a great and exciting thing for you ;)
[2015/12/30 14:18:31] <polyphagia> but doesn't TTF support bitmap fonts anyway?
[2015/12/30 14:18:37] <Tobbi> *laughing in an evil manner*
[2015/12/30 14:18:40] <giby> Tobbi, the issu is I haven't found a reliable software to do such a conversion
[2015/12/30 14:18:41] <Tobbi> Oh, I don't know.
[2015/12/30 14:18:47] <Tobbi> giby: I tried fontforge.
[2015/12/30 14:18:50] <Tobbi> I don't think it worked.
[2015/12/30 14:18:55] <giby> Tobbi, I tried
[2015/12/30 14:19:00] <polyphagia> https://fontforge.github.io/autotrace.html
[2015/12/30 14:19:02] <polyphagia> yeah
[2015/12/30 14:19:04] <polyphagia> we might be able to use a tracer
[2015/12/30 14:19:07] <polyphagia> that would be excellent
[2015/12/30 14:19:59] <polyphagia> fontforge also allows you to use it via the command line
[2015/12/30 14:20:01] <polyphagia> and python scripting
[2015/12/30 14:20:46] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/12/30 14:20:47] <Tobbi> good.
[2015/12/30 14:20:53] <polyphagia> either way i liked the look of that other font anyway :P
[2015/12/30 14:20:57] <polyphagia> there are probably tons available
[2015/12/30 14:21:00] <polyphagia> but up to you guy
[2015/12/30 14:21:02] <polyphagia> s*
[2015/12/30 14:21:09] <mt> https://ptpb.pw/paiG.svg
[2015/12/30 14:21:45] <Tobbi> That was quick.
[2015/12/30 14:21:48] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/30 14:21:53] <polyphagia> i don't think it's converted as proper arcs though
[2015/12/30 14:21:58] <mt> that is white-big.png, converted to pnm using imagemagick convert, traced using potrace with the svg background
[2015/12/30 14:22:04] <polyphagia> let me try to open it with inkscape
[2015/12/30 14:22:08] <mt> s/ground/end/
[2015/12/30 14:22:08] <red_bot> mt meant: "that is white-big.png, converted to pnm using imagemagick convert, traced using potrace with the svg backend"
[2015/12/30 14:22:30] <polyphagia> yeah it's basically just a bitmap on an svg lol
[2015/12/30 14:22:33] <polyphagia> it's not traced
[2015/12/30 14:22:43] <polyphagia> wait
[2015/12/30 14:22:51] <polyphagia> it is
[2015/12/30 14:23:01] <polyphagia> i wonder if fontforge could use this?
[2015/12/30 14:23:05] <Hume2> What about implementing all Unicode characters? It would be easy, wouldn't it?
[2015/12/30 14:23:10] <polyphagia> like 0 for instance is just 3 points
[2015/12/30 14:23:20] <polyphagia> i think you did do it mt :P sorry
[2015/12/30 14:23:27] <polyphagia> well
[2015/12/30 14:23:35] <mt> potrace did it for me
[2015/12/30 14:23:38] <polyphagia> i think it will automatically fallback Hume2
[2015/12/30 14:23:45] <polyphagia> yeah mt that's exactly what we needed
[2015/12/30 14:23:50] <polyphagia> but yeah
[2015/12/30 14:23:56] <polyphagia> with a TTF you can add unicode as well
[2015/12/30 14:24:00] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/30 14:24:05] <mt> mhm
[2015/12/30 14:24:22] <mt> the hardest part will still be implementing sdl2_ttf
[2015/12/30 14:25:28] <polyphagia> mt: https://www.npmjs.com/package/svgttf
[2015/12/30 14:25:42] <polyphagia> i can try this :P
[2015/12/30 14:25:48] <polyphagia> mt: is it?
[2015/12/30 14:25:56] <polyphagia> is the same routine not used for drawing text?
[2015/12/30 14:26:07] <mt> I don't know
[2015/12/30 14:26:09] <polyphagia> sorry i'm not familiar with the codebase
[2015/12/30 14:26:13] <polyphagia> i don't think it should be too difficult though
[2015/12/30 14:26:15] <mt> we'd have to look into that
[2015/12/30 14:26:18] <polyphagia> i imagine the method to draw text is only defined once
[2015/12/30 14:26:24] <polyphagia> and it can be replaced with a single call to SDL_DrawText
[2015/12/30 14:26:29] <polyphagia> along with some loading for the TTFs
[2015/12/30 14:26:31] <mt> polyphagia: well, try it with svgttf
[2015/12/30 14:26:39] <polyphagia> yeah i will see if i can convert it first of all
[2015/12/30 14:26:47] <polyphagia> if so then i think it's absolutely worth doing
[2015/12/30 14:26:50] <giby> Hume2, it isn't the unicode issue
[2015/12/30 14:27:08] <polyphagia> it will really shave off some code and shrink down some assets
[2015/12/30 14:27:09] <giby> We'd like to keep the supertux font....
[2015/12/30 14:27:14] <polyphagia> also would allow the font to be packaged separately in debian
[2015/12/30 14:27:23] <polyphagia> of course giby we're converting it right now :P
[2015/12/30 14:27:34] <mt> and whilst we're at it we can also get rid of Andale Mono
[2015/12/30 14:27:36] <polyphagia> trying to
[2015/12/30 14:27:48] <polyphagia> use the system mono font mt ?
[2015/12/30 14:27:50] <mt> because I think it's still unclear what licensing says about that
[2015/12/30 14:27:52] <polyphagia> or a different one
[2015/12/30 14:28:03] <polyphagia> actually
[2015/12/30 14:28:10] <mt> just use a free one or one shipped with the OS
[2015/12/30 14:28:40] <polyphagia> yeah
[2015/12/30 14:29:01] <polyphagia> the ttf font will also be good in that we can scale it
[2015/12/30 14:29:05] <polyphagia> with high DPI that's important
[2015/12/30 14:29:21] <Tobbi> Doesn't atom use one with proper licensing?
[2015/12/30 14:29:25] <polyphagia> it'd be hard to read the text playing it on an HD TV from your couch
[2015/12/30 14:29:31] <polyphagia> but with a TTF we can scale it up
[2015/12/30 14:29:51] <Tobbi> http://programmingfonts.org/list ?
[2015/12/30 14:29:55] <mt> Tobbi: there's tons of monospaced fonts we could ship with supertux
[2015/12/30 14:30:04] <Tobbi> great

[2015/12/30 14:32:24] <Tobbi> hrm
[2015/12/30 14:33:28] <Tobbi> Well, no issue on my side.
[2015/12/30 14:33:30] <mt> I'm getting that response from my usual OpenNIC resolver, 8.8.8.8 and 4.2.2.1 (Level3)
[2015/12/30 14:33:49] <polyphagia> hmm mt
[2015/12/30 14:33:58] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Can you open that URL?
[2015/12/30 14:34:00] <polyphagia> do you think it would be possible to separate each SVG in a separate file
[2015/12/30 14:34:07] <polyphagia> with the letter corresponding to the character?
[2015/12/30 14:34:10] <polyphagia> that's basically what we need to do
[2015/12/30 14:34:14] <polyphagia> and then it should be trivial
[2015/12/30 14:35:25] <mt> polyphagia: you could extract each letter as separate image using e.g. GIMP, and exporting it to PNM, then running potrace over it
[2015/12/30 14:35:33] <polyphagia> perfect you're right
[2015/12/30 14:35:38] <polyphagia> and i could find the map in the source somewhere
[2015/12/30 14:35:43] <Tobbi> Why not use imagemagick for that?
[2015/12/30 14:35:45] <polyphagia> yeah
[2015/12/30 14:35:48] <polyphagia> that's what i was going to use
[2015/12/30 14:35:50] <polyphagia> lol
[2015/12/30 14:35:54] <mt> what I used for potrace is `potrace white-big.pnm -b svg -o white-big.svg`
[2015/12/30 14:35:54] <polyphagia> check out my issue comment haha
[2015/12/30 14:35:54] <Tobbi> Should be easier to automate.
[2015/12/30 14:36:05] <polyphagia> Tobbi: http://git.io/vEFPA
[2015/12/30 14:36:07] <Tobbi> I don't know that much about imagemagick...
[2015/12/30 14:36:31] <polyphagia> the run sprite looks great btw
[2015/12/30 14:37:00] <Tobbi> hah, I have imagemagick as well.
[2015/12/30 14:37:47] <Tobbi> I should probably integrate those.
[2015/12/30 14:39:47] <polyphagia> yeah Tobbi please!
[2015/12/30 14:39:58] <polyphagia> i wasn't sure how
[2015/12/30 14:40:05] <polyphagia> i didn't check yet though
[2015/12/30 14:40:15] <polyphagia> i just replaced the walk sprite definition
[2015/12/30 14:40:17] <polyphagia> to test it

[2015/12/30 15:06:02] <polyphagia> kk Tobbi gimmie a sec
[2015/12/30 15:06:06] <mt> that somehow breaks something when Tux is big/flowerbonus
[2015/12/30 15:06:13] <polyphagia> oh
[2015/12/30 15:06:17] <polyphagia> looks like you got a tester
[2015/12/30 15:06:20] <Tobbi> mt: No, it just won't display the run sprites then.
[2015/12/30 15:06:21] <polyphagia> i'll test it too though
[2015/12/30 15:06:36] <Tobbi> big / flowerbonus uses different sprites.
[2015/12/30 15:06:45] <mt> I did test this
[2015/12/30 15:06:52] <polyphagia> kk
[2015/12/30 15:06:53] <mt> Unless it's an issue with a previous commit
[2015/12/30 15:08:07] <mt> It looks like you're in ghost mode when you run and the jump onto another platform
[2015/12/30 15:08:58] <polyphagia> i think we need a little bit of a slower music track
[2015/12/30 15:09:03] <polyphagia> for chipdisko levels
[2015/12/30 15:09:38] <polyphagia> i think opengameart has quite a bit of selection
[2015/12/30 15:10:32] <brmbrmcar> Chipdisko is quite slow.
[2015/12/30 15:10:38] <brmbrmcar> But OK.
[2015/12/30 15:11:13] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/12/30 15:11:17] <Tobbi> Can anyone else fix it.
[2015/12/30 15:11:18] <Tobbi> =
[2015/12/30 15:11:24] <Tobbi> I'm trying to fix the bomb issue.
[2015/12/30 15:11:31] <polyphagia> well idunno brmbrmcar i'm trying to compare it to the sort of music in the levels of smb
[2015/12/30 15:11:33] <polyphagia> or smb3
[2015/12/30 15:11:39] <polyphagia> i'll check it out
[2015/12/30 15:12:56] <polyphagia> also brmbrmcar maybe something with a little more of an arctic feel
[2015/12/30 15:13:01] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/12/30 15:13:27] <brmbrmcar> Out of some players chipdisko does sound slower than in-game.
[2015/12/30 15:13:59] <polyphagia> it depends on the level
[2015/12/30 15:14:05] <polyphagia> i think it would fit some levels
[2015/12/30 15:14:20] <polyphagia> especially some of the more difficult ones
[2015/12/30 15:14:42] <brmbrmcar> Any link?
[2015/12/30 15:15:16] <polyphagia> nah i'm still looking
[2015/12/30 15:15:27] <polyphagia> i think if i find something i'll post a github issue

[2015/12/30 15:41:03] <Tobbi> Hume2: How do you merge upstream changes?
[2015/12/30 15:41:08] <Tobbi> What command do you use, I mean?
[2015/12/30 15:41:40] <Hume2> Tobbi: I was working on that commit while you was working on your commits.
[2015/12/30 15:41:44] <Hume2> git pull
[2015/12/30 15:41:56] <Tobbi> Hume2: Ah, okay...you should use git pull --rebase
[2015/12/30 15:41:57] <Tobbi> iirc.
[2015/12/30 15:42:03] <Tobbi> Since that shouldn't create merge commits.
[2015/12/30 15:42:16] <Hume2> So it works even like this...
[2015/12/30 15:42:20] <Hume2> well.. OK
[2015/12/30 15:42:27] <Tobbi> I am nitpicky.

[2015/12/30 16:46:53] <Tobbi> *sigh* it's removing the <> from my github comment.
[2015/12/30 16:46:55] <polyphagia> there is one that is exclusively background, and one that has background along with enemies and powerups
[2015/12/30 16:46:56] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I see...
[2015/12/30 16:47:03] <polyphagia> so i ran imagick and made a diff
[2015/12/30 16:47:07] <polyphagia> and now i can get both
[2015/12/30 16:47:18] <polyphagia> i can just loop over all of the levels and port the entire game :P
[2015/12/30 16:47:20] <polyphagia> i'm about to
[2015/12/30 16:48:00] <polyphagia> i'm really happy with how well the levels play, the mechanics are very smooth
[2015/12/30 16:48:17] <polyphagia> better than the first game for sure, tighter controls :P
[2015/12/30 16:48:25] <Tobbi> :)

[2015/12/30 16:50:22] <Tobbi> Something is wrong with the coverity build...
[2015/12/30 16:50:43] <Tobbi> maths22: I am not sure if you are able to look into that. But you're certainly more capable than me in that aspect.

[2015/12/30 16:51:18] <Tobbi> If not, please create one and I can add you, or check the travis build log.

[2015/12/30 17:33:36] <polyphagia> i'd like to

[2015/12/30 17:34:30] <Karkus> An mp4 file?
[2015/12/30 17:34:32] <polyphagia> i've got the background, enemy, powerups, etc. just based on two images
[2015/12/30 17:34:35] <polyphagia> i can send you the stl :P
[2015/12/30 17:34:35] <Karkus> Ah, just kidding
[2015/12/30 17:34:39] <polyphagia> it's just a screen captrue
[2015/12/30 17:34:41] <polyphagia> capture*
[2015/12/30 17:34:53] <polyphagia> still a WIP, i wrote two programs to do it and one of them is on github

[2015/12/30 17:35:48] <Tobbi> But if we have 3 people working on the editor :D That's more than the whole of SuperTux has EVER seen :D
[2015/12/30 17:36:06] <Karkus> Tobbi: 4, if you include yourself.
[2015/12/30 17:36:21] <Tobbi> Karkus: Me, you, polyphagia, who else? Hume?
[2015/12/30 17:36:22] <Karkus> I guess leyyin doesn't count :P
[2015/12/30 17:36:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: mt
[2015/12/30 17:36:33] <Tobbi> oh, yes.
[2015/12/30 17:36:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, he made a few commits. (security fixes)
[2015/12/30 17:37:57] <Tobbi> right
[2015/12/30 17:39:14] <Tobbi> Also, leyyin NEVER counts :P
[2015/12/30 17:42:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: :P Of course not. I think it's while running that the sprite looks wrong. Walking is okay
[2015/12/30 17:43:04] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2015/12/30 17:43:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: It might not be looping correctly.
[2015/12/30 17:43:34] <Karkus> Tobbi: Tux seems to get fatter and thinner
[2015/12/30 17:44:02] <polyphagia> i think the first few frames are only supposed to be when he begins running?
[2015/12/30 17:44:29] <polyphagia> then it's only supposed to loop the 4-14 or something
[2015/12/30 17:44:39] <Tobbi> Ah...
[2015/12/30 17:44:42] <Tobbi> okay...
[2015/12/30 17:44:46] <polyphagia> i'm just speculating
[2015/12/30 17:44:47] <Tobbi> hrm, that's difficult.
[2015/12/30 17:45:16] <polyphagia> we might be able to remove the first few where tux "warms" up
[2015/12/30 17:45:18] <polyphagia> dunno
[2015/12/30 17:46:30] <polyphagia> but that's how smb3 is i believe Tobbi :P
[2015/12/30 17:46:45] <Tobbi> smb3?
[2015/12/30 17:46:53] <polyphagia> your sprite starts out with a slower animation and gets faster, eventually your arms outstretch at full speed
[2015/12/30 17:46:55] <polyphagia> super mario bros 3
[2015/12/30 17:46:59] <Tobbi> ah
[2015/12/30 17:47:05] <Tobbi> I never played super mario.
[2015/12/30 17:47:05] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/30 17:47:14] <polyphagia> would you play my translated maps?

[2015/12/31 08:28:34] <mt> Not strictly, SemVer says anything below 1.0.0 is considered a development release
[2015/12/31 08:29:34] <mt> however, patch version is only to be incremented for releases with just "backwards-compatible bug fixes"
[2015/12/31 08:32:32] <mt> Explanation for mode change: +C = no CTCPs but CTCP ACTION to the entire channel, +p = don't allow KNOCK, +j 5:10 = join throttling: 5 joins in 10 seconds (prevents join floods)

[2015/12/31 11:29:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: Also, I redirected brmbrmcar to #magicsupertux because that channel is emptz.

[2016/01/01 12:51:12] <Hume2> mt: You gave me three identical links.
[2016/01/01 12:53:17] <Hume2> mt: Well, not really.
[2016/01/01 12:54:39] <mt> these link to different lines in the diffs
[2016/01/01 12:55:16] <mt> basically the md5 hash in index-0_3_5.nfo (or whatever) is different from the ones in the rest of *.nfo
[2016/01/01 12:55:18] <Hume2> mt: So you compared my commits with three different commits.
[2016/01/01 12:55:31] <Hume2> Got it.
[2016/01/01 12:56:23] <Hume2> Can't get how could that happen.
[2016/01/01 12:56:25] <mt> no
[2016/01/01 12:56:46] <mt> I linked to different lines of code in the very same diff
[2016/01/01 12:57:31] <mt> I compared three *different files* in the same diff/commit
[2016/01/01 12:58:08] <Hume2> Got it. Now it makes sense.
[2016/01/01 12:59:12] <Hume2> Oh, ...
[2016/01/01 12:59:28] <Hume2> I forgot there one number from the old md.
[2016/01/01 13:01:35] <Hume2> Corrected.
[2016/01/01 13:03:36] <mt> the addon repo is a mess
[2016/01/01 13:03:38] <mt> :/
[2016/01/01 13:03:45] <mt> the thing is
[2016/01/01 13:03:50] <mt> we can't change it anymore
[2016/01/01 13:04:10] <mt> since the URLs are hardcoded into the previous release builds

[2016/01/01 14:51:14] <Karkus> Hume2: re Igloo becomes invisible: But normal (full level) tilemaps do not need to have the first 32x32px on screen to be drawn
[2016/01/01 14:51:56] <Hume2> Karkus: They do.
[2016/01/01 14:52:25] <Hume2> Almost all tiles are 32Ã32, so they draw only when they are on-screen.

[2016/01/01 17:32:23] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/01 17:32:27] <Tobbi> leyyin: Okay, I am kidding.
[2016/01/01 17:32:32] <leyyin> are you?
[2016/01/01 17:32:45] <Tobbi> leyyin: You can have my word: I don't shoot people.
[2016/01/01 17:32:52] <Tobbi> I have never shot a person.
[2016/01/01 17:33:17] <Tobbi> There are other ways to brutally murder someone.

[2016/01/01 17:36:58] <Tobbi> No, my room is messy, so I'd rather avoid that extra amount of work.

[2016/01/01 17:42:59] <leyyin> went out with some friends and drank and played some computer games :P
[2016/01/01 17:43:03] <leyyin> and card games
[2016/01/01 17:44:30] <Tobbi> :D

[2016/01/01 17:44:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: I would've gone out with friends. But I don't have any friends.
[2016/01/01 17:45:08] <leyyin> you have, sigh

[2016/01/01 17:47:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: Okay, so I went to see the fireworks at the Flensburg Fjord...and suddenly bumped into someone I met at a party several years ago...
[2016/01/01 17:47:40] <Tobbi> And she invited me to a disco.
[2016/01/01 17:47:47] <Tobbi> So I danced until around 5 in the morning.
[2016/01/01 17:47:58] <leyyin> you see
[2016/01/01 17:48:05] <leyyin> you had a good time :P

[2016/01/01 17:57:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: For the record, poison is too slow. Suffocation is far better.
[2016/01/01 17:58:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, right.
[2016/01/01 17:58:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: Having experience? :P
[2016/01/01 17:58:33] <Karkus> Just a little tip :D
[2016/01/01 17:58:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/01 17:58:42] <leyyin> kinda wrong, if you use the right poison, he can be dead in seconds
[2016/01/01 17:59:11] <Tobbi> I hate tap water... urgh.
[2016/01/01 17:59:26] <Tobbi> disgusting stuff.
[2016/01/01 17:59:51] <Karkus> leyyin: What if you are walking along the street at night, and really want to kill someone? a) where do you get the poison, b) How do you cause your target to ingest it? This is why it is slow.
[2016/01/01 18:00:12] <leyyin> this is getting creepy
[2016/01/01 18:00:21] <leyyin> Karkus, congrats, you are on the list
[2016/01/01 18:00:33] <Karkus> leyyin: What list?

[2016/01/01 21:26:41] <snadge> if you cant get through the first bit big.. you cant break the blocks to skip the bit with the 3 spiky guys (not sure what they're called)
[2016/01/01 21:27:15] <snadge> and its really hard to get through the first bit without touching one of the bouncing things
[2016/01/01 21:27:23] <snadge> horrible level :P
[2016/01/01 21:27:48] <snadge> fortunately its not compulsory to get passed it to access other levels.. so someone was kind enough to design the world map that way
[2016/01/01 21:30:03] @ Quit: Wuzzy2: Quit: Wuzzy2
[2016/01/01 21:30:31] <snadge> what would be really cool is if someone posted on youtube speedruns of all the test levels

[2016/01/01 21:42:21] <head8deb1an> Hello snadge, welcome to #supertux. :)
[2016/01/01 21:49:00] <snadge> i've been here since the 0.4 release announcement on slashdot :D
[2016/01/01 21:49:25] <snadge> i realised that whilst i've been aware of this game.. i've never finished it.. now im just trying to finish all the contrib levels
[2016/01/01 21:58:14] <snadge> no bells in that level either.. i want to punch the person who made it
[2016/01/01 21:58:30] <snadge> got the furthest i've ever had in it.. died
[2016/01/01 22:06:25] <head8deb1an> snadge: Thats why they are contributor levels.
[2016/01/01 22:07:00] <head8deb1an> They are playable and decent though, or they wouldnt be in our repos.
[2016/01/01 22:21:21] <snadge> yeah the actual game was relatively easy
[2016/01/02 00:16:02] <snadge> damn .. i cant get criu to work with supertux
[2016/01/02 00:17:24] <snadge> i want a savestate feature :P
[2016/01/02 00:17:44] <snadge> i dont want to play the same part of the level.. 50,000 times over, just to get back to the bit where i repeatedly die
[2016/01/02 00:19:25] <snadge> kevin.. wherever you are, i hate you

[2016/01/02 05:00:26] <mt> what would that do
[2016/01/02 05:04:54] <snadge> how do i find the hidden levels in bonus island 3?
[2016/01/02 05:08:47] <mt> search better
[2016/01/02 05:09:18] <snadge> i've pretty much wandered around the whole map
[2016/01/02 05:09:37] <mt> there's one level not on the main path. find out how to access it and then you'll also be able to access to other secret levels
[2016/01/02 05:09:40] <snadge> now im trying to understand how worldmap.stwm works ;)
[2016/01/02 05:10:03] <snadge> oh so there is a level i haven't played thats visible
[2016/01/02 05:10:04] <mt> well you could open that in the C# editor (possibly also flexlay)
[2016/01/02 05:10:10] <mt> yes
[2016/01/02 05:10:22] <mt> on the very right
[2016/01/02 05:10:31] <mt> (is that east in the game?)
[2016/01/02 05:13:28] <polyphag1> mt: like the poison mushroom in smb2
[2016/01/02 05:13:32] <polyphag1> the japanese one
[2016/01/02 05:13:36] <polyphag1> hurt you :P
[2016/01/02 05:13:42] <polyphag1> but it comes out of a regular ? box
[2016/01/02 05:13:51] <polyphag1> i think a green tinted egg would work
[2016/01/02 05:14:13] <mt> LMH has a death-flower on their worldmap
[2016/01/02 05:14:20] <polyphag1> oh nice
[2016/01/02 05:14:23] <polyphag1> does it move though?
[2016/01/02 05:14:43] <mt> it behaves just like fire-, air-, earth- or ice- flower
[2016/01/02 05:14:56] <mt> except that it kills/shrinks you
[2016/01/02 05:15:05] <polyphag1> so you haven't seen something that came out of a box, does damage and moved like the egg?
[2016/01/02 05:15:14] <snadge> i cant go east in bonus world 3
[2016/01/02 05:15:18] <polyphag1> the death flower sounds cool though
[2016/01/02 05:15:29] <polyphag1> i can use that in the mean time
[2016/01/02 05:15:52] <mt> snadge: do you know where the level "The Toilette zone" is
[2016/01/02 05:16:10] <mt> there's the entrance to the hidden area
[2016/01/02 05:18:21] <snadge> hmm.. i dont seem to have that level
[2016/01/02 05:19:17] <snadge> is it in the release 0.4 version?
[2016/01/02 05:19:40] <mt> yes
[2016/01/02 05:19:55] <mt> it's been there since Bonus Island III exists, iirc
[2016/01/02 05:20:09] <mt> it's the very eastern level, you should see a red dot there
[2016/01/02 05:20:50] <mt> oh actually you don't
[2016/01/02 05:20:54] <mt> if you haven't solved it
[2016/01/02 05:21:14] <snadge> the most eastern level is "a hilly landscape"
[2016/01/02 05:21:33] <mt> you're very close
[2016/01/02 05:21:40] <mt> there's a forest, right?
[2016/01/02 05:21:41] <snadge> or "the dark castle"
[2016/01/02 05:21:43] <snadge> yeah
[2016/01/02 05:21:44] <mt> it's hidden in there
[2016/01/02 05:21:56] <mt> there's a possibility to walk into the forest
[2016/01/02 05:23:43] <snadge> found it :)
[2016/01/02 05:23:48] <snadge> not sure how i missed that
[2016/01/02 05:27:23] <stewboy> well, I found a hidden 'flower bonus' level, that was pretty cool
[2016/01/02 05:27:55] <mt> polyphag1: there's a death-flower: https://urandom.eu.org/i/3cxZvDMQ.png
[2016/01/02 05:28:27] <polyphag1> what's the title of that map pack?
[2016/01/02 05:28:54] <stewboy> this secret level is actually kind of sickening, in the bit where the background scrolls fast
[2016/01/02 05:30:00] <stewboy> oh wow, this secret area is huge
[2016/01/02 05:30:17] <snadge> iyeah
[2016/01/02 05:30:20] <mt> polyphag1: "Mattie's world" by "LMH"
[2016/01/02 05:31:14] <mt> stewboy: didn't you have to expect that from the levels finished/total levels count in the menu?
[2016/01/02 05:31:28] <stewboy> I didn't pay any attention to that :P
[2016/01/02 05:32:03] <mt> we've also put some levels that we included in 0.3.x as separate add-on in the Bonus Island III
[2016/01/02 05:32:14] <mt> (levels by "Torfi Gunnarson" oslt)
[2016/01/02 05:41:37] <snadge> dont miss your ride

[2016/01/02 08:15:32] <mt> Also wanted to translate it but it's a weird text
[2016/01/02 08:15:41] <mt> Maybe play the level?

[2016/01/02 08:37:36] <Tobbi> I confused it with some other author of some other island.

[2016/01/02 08:38:10] <kneekoo> :))
[2016/01/02 08:38:10] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2016/01/02 08:38:49] <kneekoo> is the level editor included?
[2016/01/02 08:38:56] <kneekoo> with the game
[2016/01/02 08:39:20] <Tobbi> kneekoo: Neither is included...
[2016/01/02 08:39:35] <Tobbi> kneekoo: There are several level editors...currently we're developing one of them :P
[2016/01/02 08:39:42] <Tobbi> Sorry, two.
[2016/01/02 08:39:54] <kneekoo> ok, good to know
[2016/01/02 08:40:08] <kneekoo> will it be included with the game?
[2016/01/02 08:40:11] <mt> Hume2 is developing another one
[2016/01/02 08:40:22] <mt> Hume2's will be included with the game
[2016/01/02 08:40:41] <kneekoo> oh boy... with good English, I hope :P
[2016/01/02 08:40:46] <mt> the other one is written in Python and uses PyQt4, which should be available for all platforms
[2016/01/02 08:41:19] <mt> running the python editor when you've got python and pyqt4 installed is as easy as running one shell command

[2016/01/02 08:49:46] <kneekoo> nice :)
[2016/01/02 08:50:09] <Tobbi> The flexlay one will get better in terms of usability.
[2016/01/02 08:50:16] <Tobbi> Karkus and I are working on that.
[2016/01/02 08:50:23] <mt> installing flexlay on debian/ubuntu is `sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pyqt4`, `git clone -b develop https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay.git` `cd flexlay` `python3 supertux-editor`
[2016/01/02 08:50:33] <mt> if you don't want to start using advanced features
[2016/01/02 08:50:39] <mt> flexlay should be working fine for now
[2016/01/02 08:51:02] <mt> Tobbi: btw, I saw Tiled and it actually looked pretty interesting as well
[2016/01/02 08:51:21] <mt> wonder how hard it would be to integrate supertux levels/worldmaps into it
[2016/01/02 08:51:22] <Tobbi> mt: I know, but it's pretty hard to integrate advanced features.
[2016/01/02 08:52:10] <mt> manage dotfiles using cmake (y/n)? :D # actually a serious question
[2016/01/02 08:53:04] <Tobbi> what?
[2016/01/02 08:53:39] <mt> I wonder if I should do that
[2016/01/02 08:53:58] <mt> I had this as an idea for replacing those silly setup.sh scripts people usually use
[2016/01/02 08:54:53] <Tobbi> I see...
[2016/01/02 08:54:54] <Tobbi> Whatever...
[2016/01/02 08:55:05] <mt> well I'll try it
[2016/01/02 08:55:13] <Tobbi> I think we should move away from managing add-ons using lisp files
[2016/01/02 08:55:18] <Tobbi> It's so unhandy.

[2016/01/02 09:02:32] @ polyphag1 is now known as polyphagia
[2016/01/02 09:03:00] <polyphagia> yeah flexlay is better than the mono editor for sure
[2016/01/02 09:03:12] <polyphagia> the mono one was crashing for me
[2016/01/02 09:03:33] <polyphagia> and like others mentioned the mono dependency itself which is fairly large
[2016/01/02 09:05:08] <polyphagia> i think we should look toward mario maker for the ingame editor
[2016/01/02 09:05:56] <kneekoo> that's the 4th editor I hear about in 30 minutes :P

[2016/01/02 09:07:35] <Tobbi> You know...there's one point in life where I don't want to hear about other editors.
[2016/01/02 09:07:35] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/01/02 09:08:01] <polyphagia> which are you working on Tobbi ?
[2016/01/02 09:08:08] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Currently, only flexlay.
[2016/01/02 09:08:14] <kneekoo> all I want is an in-game editor - if possible
[2016/01/02 09:08:24] <kneekoo> if not, an external one would be nice too
[2016/01/02 09:08:30] <Tobbi> kneekoo: Hume should get you covered there.
[2016/01/02 09:08:40] <Tobbi> It won't be advanced though, no scripting etc.
[2016/01/02 09:08:47] <polyphagia> oh ok yeah i enjoyed using flexlay
[2016/01/02 09:09:14] <polyphagia> yeah and that's how it should be imo Tobbi
[2016/01/02 09:09:28] <polyphagia> people really love to make levels if it's easy
[2016/01/02 09:09:29] <Tobbi> Yeah, it's fine.
[2016/01/02 09:09:40] <polyphagia> no need to overwhelm people with features they wouldn't be able to use
[2016/01/02 09:09:49] <polyphagia> and if they want, they can always learn how to use an external editor :P
[2016/01/02 09:09:53] <Tobbi> Still, the advanced levels are more fun :)
[2016/01/02 09:09:56] <mt> kneekoo: not the 4th one, mono editor = c# editor
[2016/01/02 09:09:56] <polyphagia> of course we can always work to make all of them more intuitive
[2016/01/02 09:10:53] <polyphagia> meh Tobbi there's some fun in simplicity too. people have been playing the same mario games for 30 years :P
[2016/01/02 09:11:02] <mt> I guess the in-game one will be great for people who just want to create levels
[2016/01/02 09:11:03] <Tobbi> hmm, right.
[2016/01/02 09:11:08] <polyphagia> exactly
[2016/01/02 09:11:12] <mt> flexlay should be developed for the level designers
[2016/01/02 09:11:13] <Tobbi> We need a terrain generator... :P
[2016/01/02 09:11:20] <Tobbi> in Flexlay, I mean.
[2016/01/02 09:11:39] <mt> I think Hume2 has got a script to generate random levels
[2016/01/02 09:11:57] <mt> (ones which make sense)
[2016/01/02 09:11:57] <polyphagia> i'm *almost* done with my 30 ported mario levels
[2016/01/02 09:12:11] <polyphagia> that would be a fun project
[2016/01/02 09:12:16] <polyphagia> random levels :P
[2016/01/02 09:12:16] <mt> polyphagia: for supertux?
[2016/01/02 09:12:19] <polyphagia> yeah mt
[2016/01/02 09:12:29] <Tobbi> mt: I am thinking about something where you create a path and it will create a fitting ice terrain for you :)
[2016/01/02 09:12:30] <polyphagia> the original game had 32 but tux can't swim
[2016/01/02 09:12:36] <polyphagia> so i nixed the water levels
[2016/01/02 09:12:37] <Tobbi> Maybe I'll work on that next.
[2016/01/02 09:12:40] <polyphagia> they weren't fun anyway

[2016/01/02 10:09:59] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2016/01/02 10:23:06] <Karkus> Tobbi: What was that Windows executable creator (from Python 3) which leyyin suggested?
[2016/01/02 10:23:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, I would need to check the logs.
[2016/01/02 10:23:23] <Tobbi> I really can't remember.
[2016/01/02 10:23:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: I will look

[2016/01/02 10:29:16] <Karkus> head8debian: On red bot, can you ignore Not-e81f?
[2016/01/02 10:29:23] <Karkus> Actually, maybe not..
[2016/01/02 10:31:30] <Tobbi> I'm really having trouble finding that python wrapper.
[2016/01/02 10:32:16] <Tobbi> Karkus: there is this: http://www.py2exe.org/
[2016/01/02 10:32:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes, I will look into that, but didn't leyyin suggest something else?
[2016/01/02 10:32:59] <Tobbi> hmm, I don't know...
[2016/01/02 10:33:07] <Tobbi> If I could remember...well...let's see...
[2016/01/02 10:33:11] <lumidify> There is http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/.
[2016/01/02 10:34:09] <Tobbi> Oh, that website looks familiar as well.
[2016/01/02 10:36:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: This is what leyyin said: http://www.pyinstaller.org/
[2016/01/02 10:36:44] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, maybe let's go with this then.
[2016/01/02 10:36:59] <Karkus> lumidify: Any experience with this?
[2016/01/02 10:37:12] <Karkus> cx_freeze
[2016/01/02 10:37:18] <lumidify> Not really, I just fiddled around with it ages ago.
[2016/01/02 10:37:22] <lumidify> Sorry.
[2016/01/02 10:37:31] <Karkus> lumidify: No problem.
[2016/01/02 10:37:40] <Karkus> Research time.
[2016/01/02 10:37:53] <grumbel> I have used cx_freeze in the past
[2016/01/02 10:38:24] <grumbel> It works reasonably well, but creates rather ugly directories, as all the libaries are scattered around in the top level directory
[2016/01/02 10:38:37] <grumbel> Not very user friendly, but gets the job done
[2016/01/02 10:38:56] <lumidify> http://cx-freeze.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
[2016/01/02 10:39:13] <grumbel> Compatibility is also a problem, some of the Python exe builders come with Qt4 build in, some come with nothing at all, some support Python3, some only Python2, etc.
[2016/01/02 10:39:38] <Tobbi> pyinstaller claims to have "intelligent support for many packages" and that includes pyqt3
[2016/01/02 10:39:40] <grumbel> Has been over a year since I looked at them, so they might have cought up in the meantime
[2016/01/02 10:39:49] <Tobbi> eeh 4 and 5
[2016/01/02 10:40:31] <grumbel> Also seems to have Python3 support
[2016/01/02 10:42:22] <grumbel> If pyinstall can deal with Qt5, we could update the flexlay code base to Qt5, that was one of the main reasons why I stayed with Qt4
[2016/01/02 10:43:04] <Karkus> grumbel: "PyQt5	OK	Full support, including plugins." https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/Supported-Packages
[2016/01/02 10:45:29] <Tobbi> sounds good.
[2016/01/02 10:47:22] <grumbel> python3-pyqt5 bindings also seem to be in Ubuntu14.04LTS

[2016/01/02 11:22:24] <mt> can we look into getting https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/milestones/0.4.1 done?
[2016/01/02 11:22:41] <mt> I guess we should release a bugfix release soon
[2016/01/02 11:24:08] <Tobbi> Hrm.
[2016/01/02 11:24:16] <Tobbi> Some of these things on the list are not very...
[2016/01/02 11:24:18] <Tobbi> easy.
[2016/01/02 11:27:00] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/312 could be delayed until editor is integrated
[2016/01/02 11:27:38] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/305 blame giby_the_kid; make him add the missing characters until support for TTF is there
[2016/01/02 11:28:05] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/314 not a bugfix
[2016/01/02 11:28:19] <polyphagia> yeah right click isn't immediately relevant until we have editor
[2016/01/02 11:28:34] <Tobbi> mt: I wish I knew how those font glyphs are created...are they hand-drawn?
[2016/01/02 11:28:52] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/307 try to fix but also possible to delay until next release as it's not a feature intended for users
[2016/01/02 11:29:30] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/298 please test, I want to merge this (cc: alket)
[2016/01/02 11:30:02] <mt> Tobbi: I think so
[2016/01/02 11:30:07] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2016/01/02 11:30:15] <Tobbi> I closed the 0.4.0 milestone, jsyk
[2016/01/02 11:30:20] <mt> but we should annoy giby_the_kid as long as we don't know what we can break more
[2016/01/02 11:30:29] <polyphagia> i wish i had a supertux sticker for my laptop :P
[2016/01/02 11:30:56] <Tobbi> We could use donations for that ^^
[2016/01/02 11:30:57] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/258 seems easy to do, not really important however
[2016/01/02 11:30:58] <alket> mt: ok
[2016/01/02 11:30:59] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/02 11:31:05] <polyphagia> yeah Tobbi i think it'd be a good idea
[2016/01/02 11:31:13] <polyphagia> donations could be used for some new artwork and music
[2016/01/02 11:31:24] <polyphagia> and to compensate the hardworking developers of course
[2016/01/02 11:31:31] <giby_the_kid> Hi
[2016/01/02 11:31:35] <polyphagia> hi friend
[2016/01/02 11:31:37] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Problem is: We need someone who manages them. :P
[2016/01/02 11:31:41] <Tobbi> Donations, I mean.
[2016/01/02 11:31:42] <mt> then we'd be at the point where we don't know who takes the legal responsability for donations
[2016/01/02 11:31:46] <polyphagia> Tobbi: SPI might be able to
[2016/01/02 11:31:50] <Tobbi> hrm...
[2016/01/02 11:32:04] <giby_the_kid> mt: which glyph are missing?
[2016/01/02 11:32:09] <polyphagia> they were looking for new projects to support Tobbi
[2016/01/02 11:32:11] <Tobbi> There are no donations. There are only voluntary contributions towards a common good cause.
[2016/01/02 11:32:19] <polyphagia> and supertux is a staple in gnulinux :P
[2016/01/02 11:32:20] <Tobbi> where good cause = my wellbeing.
[2016/01/02 11:32:29] <polyphagia> fair enough
[2016/01/02 11:32:40] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I'd use donations to pay for naked women giving me a massage.
[2016/01/02 11:32:42] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/02 11:32:47] <Tobbi> Totally supports the cause.
[2016/01/02 11:32:50] <Tobbi> Makes me relaxed.
[2016/01/02 11:32:55] <Tobbi> Makes me a better developer :D
[2016/01/02 11:32:58] <polyphagia> whatever gets the work done Tobbi
[2016/01/02 11:33:02] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/01/02 11:33:06] <polyphagia> :D
[2016/01/02 11:33:19] <Karkus> Changed right click -> 0.5.0
[2016/01/02 11:33:27] <polyphagia> kk cool
[2016/01/02 11:33:42] <Tobbi> I'm not so much in favour of the new christmas hats.
[2016/01/02 11:33:51] <Tobbi> because the association is red = santa cap.
[2016/01/02 11:34:03] <Tobbi> People might not be making these associations for other colours.
[2016/01/02 11:34:21] <Tobbi> But only my 2 cents.
[2016/01/02 11:34:45] <Tobbi> I can imagine people having the need for consistency.
[2016/01/02 11:34:55] <mt> giby_the_kid: see the issue I mentioned

[2016/01/02 12:22:03] <mt> what's wrong with that?

[2016/01/02 12:38:06] <mt> if you want to make a pipe that makes a turn
[2016/01/02 12:38:11] <mt> as in LMH's levels

[2016/01/02 12:47:36] <Karkus> idk how to use GIMP
[2016/01/02 12:47:56] <mt> don't use GIMP or Photoshop without a tablet if it's to draw
[2016/01/02 12:48:04] <Karkus> mt: What should I use?
[2016/01/02 12:48:15] <mt> this works for now
[2016/01/02 12:48:23] <mt> but drawing without a tablet is uh
[2016/01/02 12:48:31] <mt> not very nice
[2016/01/02 12:48:34] <Karkus> mt: Do you understand what I mean, though?
[2016/01/02 12:48:38] <mt> yes
[2016/01/02 12:49:03] <mt> well we already have objects with paths
[2016/01/02 12:49:06] <mt> but those move
[2016/01/02 12:50:45] <Karkus> mt: We need an enter animation, and sector changing too.
[2016/01/02 12:51:12] <mt> yeah
[2016/01/02 12:52:08] <Karkus> mt: And we can draw it all together with the editor, making it easy to create pipes
[2016/01/02 13:01:00] <polyphagia> i think it's pretty obvious the game is inspired by mario so the pipe transportation isn't really that bad lol
[2016/01/02 13:01:08] <polyphagia> i don't get how that's where the line is drawn :P
[2016/01/02 13:01:15] <polyphagia> doesn't mean swimming can't be implemented in a unique manner though
[2016/01/02 13:01:40] <polyphagia> pipes could have something to do with some sort of tub or resevoir
[2016/01/02 13:05:17] <polyphagia> but yeah i like that idea, especially changing directions

[2016/01/02 13:54:34] <polyphagia> yeah Karkus great idea
[2016/01/02 13:57:27] <Karkus> polyphagia: This is already in SuperTux, used for flying platforms, by the way.
[2016/01/02 13:58:30] <polyphagia> but not for pipes Karkus ?
[2016/01/02 13:58:42] <Karkus> polyphagia: Not yet, no.
[2016/01/02 13:58:45] <Karkus> :D
[2016/01/02 13:59:12] <polyphagia> ic well it makes the most sense to me
[2016/01/02 13:59:24] <polyphagia> some of the later SMB games even had multidirectional pipes
[2016/01/02 13:59:35] <polyphagia> although mostly as a transitional effect
[2016/01/02 14:00:58] <Karkus> multidirectional? As in, both backwards and forwards?
[2016/01/02 14:01:04] <Karkus> Or, like a fork?
[2016/01/02 14:01:15] <Karkus> polyphagia: ^
[2016/01/02 14:01:29] <polyphagia> no forks, just going in NESW

[2016/01/02 14:02:29] <polyphagia> i'll try and find one yeah
[2016/01/02 14:02:35] <mt> levels have Â±x or Â±y (possibly also Â±z for 3D), not NESW
[2016/01/02 14:03:31] <polyphagia> north is y + 1, x
[2016/01/02 14:03:33] <polyphagia> south is y - 1, x
[2016/01/02 14:03:35] <polyphagia> etc
[2016/01/02 14:04:08] <mt> you can't speak of NESW unless you're looking from the top
[2016/01/02 14:04:21] <polyphagia> plenty of GUI toolkits use NESW
[2016/01/02 14:04:32] <polyphagia> west is x - 1, east is x + 1
[2016/01/02 14:04:34] <mt> or unless you have some very strange magnetic fields simulated in the game
[2016/01/02 14:04:38] <polyphagia> north is y - 1, south is y + 1
[2016/01/02 14:05:00] <polyphagia> from tux's 2d perspective
[2016/01/02 14:05:09] <polyphagia> well from your perspective watching tux
[2016/01/02 14:06:00] <polyphagia> hmm Karkus i don't think they were actually multidirectional, it must have just been for transitions

[2016/01/02 14:49:55] <polyphagia> oo good point grumbel
[2016/01/02 14:50:06] <polyphagia> i think an actual canon would be a neat object
[2016/01/02 14:50:22] <polyphagia> although maybe something that provided more to the gameplay
[2016/01/02 14:50:46] <polyphagia> like those enemies that eat you and spit you out
[2016/01/02 15:01:13] <mt> a canon you can enter?
[2016/01/02 15:02:44] <grumbel> You enter via a normal vertical pipe and then get shoot out the 45Â° end
[2016/01/02 15:03:18] <grumbel> That said, I wouldn't spend to much effort implementing that, as it doesn't really add all that much to the gameplay
[2016/01/02 15:03:56] <grumbel> We also don't have any kind of advanced air-mechanics, so it would be a little useless
[2016/01/02 15:03:59] <grumbel> Mario had a cape
[2016/01/02 15:06:42] <polyphagia> yeah i was going to say
[2016/01/02 15:07:01] <polyphagia> it'd be great to have a flying item, but that's not really a priority or anything
[2016/01/02 15:07:37] <Karkus> What about wall-kicking? That could be a part of the earth power-up
[2016/01/02 15:07:59] <polyphagia> yeah wall jumps would be really cool
[2016/01/02 15:08:01] <Karkus> Or maybe if you get 5 flowers of the same type you could become a super version?
[2016/01/02 15:08:09] <polyphagia> wall jumps would be excellent for secrets
[2016/01/02 15:08:15] <polyphagia> Karkus: like mega mario
[2016/01/02 15:08:18] <polyphagia> :P
[2016/01/02 15:08:25] <polyphagia> the extra large one from the DS version
[2016/01/02 15:08:46] <polyphagia> or maybe we could implement an item that makes tux tiny as well :D
[2016/01/02 15:08:49] <Karkus> polyphagia: Well, if you get 5 fire flowers, you could launch huge fireballs, idk
[2016/01/02 15:09:30] <polyphagia> maybe be able to launch two at once  Karkus
[2016/01/02 15:09:37] <polyphagia> or fireballs that could hit through two enemies
[2016/01/02 15:09:39] <polyphagia> before disappearing
[2016/01/02 15:09:42] <polyphagia> instead of one
[2016/01/02 15:09:51] <polyphagia> dunno
[2016/01/02 15:09:53] <Karkus> polyphagia: You can fire two fireballs anyway
[2016/01/02 15:10:00] <polyphagia> well more than two :P
[2016/01/02 15:10:03] <mt> let's focus on getting 0.4.1 done

[2016/01/02 15:57:10] <Tobbi> polyphagia: It resets to home position if there's something wrong with the position.
[2016/01/02 15:57:12] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2016/01/02 15:57:28] <polyphagia> ah
[2016/01/02 15:57:39] <polyphagia> would it log that?
[2016/01/02 15:59:12] <Tobbi> Let me see...
[2016/01/02 15:59:16] <polyphagia> mmk
[2016/01/02 15:59:58] <polyphagia> wow this guy got almost 2000 coins from the first four levels :
[2016/01/02 16:00:00] <polyphagia> :P
[2016/01/02 16:00:41] <Tobbi> We have this: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/src/worldmap/worldmap.cpp#L654
[2016/01/02 16:01:06] <polyphagia> yeah that's probably what he's getting
[2016/01/02 16:01:08] <Tobbi> And we have this: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/src/worldmap/worldmap.cpp#L1078
[2016/01/02 16:01:16] <polyphagia> oo
[2016/01/02 16:01:18] <Tobbi> So, either illegal position or the table could not be saved.
[2016/01/02 16:01:24] <polyphagia> he said it happened every time Tobbi
[2016/01/02 16:01:27] <polyphagia> so probably the latter
[2016/01/02 16:01:32] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/01/02 16:01:52] <Tobbi> wait, it's in load_state...
[2016/01/02 16:01:58] <Tobbi> which happens when a worldmap gets loaded.
[2016/01/02 16:02:07] <Tobbi> which happens when he exits from the game.

[2016/01/02 16:06:48] <Tobbi> polyphagia: That's because the falling layer is not calculated correctly.
[2016/01/02 16:06:52] <Tobbi> I have had trouble with that in the past.

[2016/01/02 21:38:56] <snadge> i found a secret area in blue iced hills
[2016/01/02 21:39:24] <snadge> which is cool. heaps of coins etc.. but i dont know how to make the jump on the left hand side.. i hit an invisible platform and fall down the hole
[2016/01/02 21:39:42] <snadge> maybe its just there to troll me
[2016/01/02 21:56:00] <head8debian> snadge: You *should* be able to get out of any area somehow, if the level is adhering to our level design guidelines.
[2016/01/02 21:57:33] @ swift110 joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/02 22:09:23] <snadge> yeah.. i only found 1 secret out of 5 in that level. so its chock full of goodies apparently
[2016/01/02 22:09:37] <snadge> now im trying to beat angry stone vs you
[2016/01/02 22:09:43] <snadge> that level is criminal
[2016/01/02 22:09:51] <snadge> death penalty for the creator :p
[2016/01/02 22:10:39] <snadge> also missingno
[2016/01/02 22:10:43] <snadge> same guy
[2016/01/02 22:11:25] <snadge> theres a steep hill in missingno where you have to avoid 3 bouncy spikes in a row.. then 2 regular spikey guys
[2016/01/02 22:12:40] <snadge> its too difficult.. i think one of the guidelines should be that someone has to post a youtube video of it being completed
[2016/01/02 22:12:47] <snadge> 100% and with all the secrets ;)
[2016/01/02 22:13:44] <snadge> playing games shouldn't make you angry.. i've used more profanity in the last few days than i have in the year previous ;)

[2016/01/03 08:17:09] <Karkus> mt, Tobbi: We could create a develop branch, and keep 0.5.0 changes there while keeping master at 0.4.0 -> 0.4.1 changes?
[2016/01/03 08:17:34] <Tobbi> perhaps...might make sense.
[2016/01/03 08:17:36] <mt> Karkus: there's release/0.4 for 0.4.0 -> 0.4.1 branches
[2016/01/03 08:17:44] <Tobbi> oh right
[2016/01/03 08:17:48] <mt> everything relevant for 0.4.1 will be cherry-picked into that
[2016/01/03 08:18:24] <Karkus> mt: So it's safe to merge 0.5.0 pull requests into master?
[2016/01/03 08:18:37] <Karkus> mt: Surely not...
[2016/01/03 08:18:48] <mt> Yes it is
[2016/01/03 08:18:52] <Karkus> Cherry picking it all could take forever
[2016/01/03 08:18:58] <mt> But editor not
[2016/01/03 08:19:08] <Karkus> mt: The editor isn't stable.
[2016/01/03 08:19:23] <mt> Karkus: cherry-picking the commits takes maximum 10 minutes
[2016/01/03 08:19:47] <mt> otoh, we should actually do that already when committing bugfixes

[2016/01/03 08:25:05] <Tobbi> Why are so many things in that editor branch marked virtual?
[2016/01/03 08:25:14] <Tobbi> Do we plan to subclass angrystone at some point?
[2016/01/03 08:27:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hume changed a method there to virtual?
[2016/01/03 08:28:11] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, it was virtual at the start as well. I mean: You know: I can understand that get_name in badguy is virtual because we're overriding it. But things that actually are at the leaf branch of class inheritance shouldn't need virtual anymore.
[2016/01/03 08:28:19] <Tobbi> Unless we plan to create sub-classes of those.
[2016/01/03 08:28:39] <Tobbi> And creating classes that inherit from angrystone would just be silly.
[2016/01/03 08:28:48] <Karkus> Tobbi: We don't even need to override them.

[2016/01/03 12:52:42] <mt> or fix the tile renderer to handle this properly
[2016/01/03 12:53:11] <Hume2> Adding extra tiles won't affect already existing levels.
[2016/01/03 12:53:40] <mt> That also implies updating existing levels
[2016/01/03 12:53:48] <Hume2> Maybe there could be a property that says that the tile should be always rendered.
[2016/01/03 12:55:00] <Hume2> When are we at updating levels, we can put decals instead.
[2016/01/03 12:55:57] <Hume2> Well... that thing with "tile being always rendered attribute" could lag.
[2016/01/03 12:56:33] <Hume2> Because it would have to pass whole tilemap to draw it then.
[2016/01/03 12:56:51] <Hume2> Currently it passes only the visible tiles.
[2016/01/03 12:57:29] <mt> or it passes all tiles in a specific grid, specified by x and y from the origin of the main tile
[2016/01/03 12:58:33] <Hume2> hmmm...
[2016/01/03 12:59:31] <Hume2> Yes. The x and y are the camera coordinates.

[2016/01/03 13:04:44] <Hume2> Finally no visitation.
[2016/01/03 13:05:33] <Hume2> It was terrible.
[2016/01/03 13:06:09] <Tobbi> Hume2: Currently, I don't need anything.
[2016/01/03 13:06:15] <Tobbi> Hume2: visitation?
[2016/01/03 13:06:31] <Hume2> Yes, Narre and one madman visited me.
[2016/01/03 13:06:41] <Hume2> Narre was OK, but...
[2016/01/03 13:06:58] <Tobbi> A mad man...
[2016/01/03 13:07:02] <Tobbi> I see....
[2016/01/03 13:07:49] <Hume2> he wanted to know what time is it, I was telling him that it's quarter to 6, because he should have been at home at 6.
[2016/01/03 13:08:11] <Hume2> And Narre was telling that it's quarter past 17. It was 17:10.
[2016/01/03 13:09:27] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/03 13:09:31] <Tobbi> I see...
[2016/01/03 13:09:58] <Hume2> And he also wanted to install SuperTux on his machine from Narre, Narre explained it to him, but he was requesting Narre to install it him at his home.
[2016/01/03 13:10:19] <Hume2> Narre told him that he's not going more than 200m, but it was 700m.
[2016/01/03 13:10:38] <Tobbi> ...kids.
[2016/01/03 13:10:47] <Hume2> Yes. Agreed.
[2016/01/03 13:10:55] <Tobbi> I mean all of you :D
[2016/01/03 13:11:09] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2016/01/03 13:11:16] <Tobbi> It's a shame, leyyin isn't here. Otherwise, he'd say the same.
[2016/01/03 13:13:03] <Hume2> However this is not a typical conversation for me and Narre. It was really an odd day.
[2016/01/03 13:14:01] <Hume2> The first day this guy visited me.
[2016/01/03 13:15:24] <Tobbi> Hume2: How old are you? You sound like 15 or 16.
[2016/01/03 13:15:26] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/01/03 13:15:30] <Hume2> 17
[2016/01/03 13:15:44] <Tobbi> Ah okay.
[2016/01/03 13:16:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: People are odd.
[2016/01/03 13:16:15] <Tobbi> I noticed that myself.
[2016/01/03 13:16:33] <Hume2> Just for info, that madman is really mad, he goes to special school.
[2016/01/03 13:17:15] <Tobbi> Hume2: Everyone is a little bit mad.
[2016/01/03 13:17:24] <Hume2> Agreed, even me.
[2016/01/03 13:18:27] <Tobbi> See.
[2016/01/03 13:18:44] <Tobbi> I once went to a special school as well... :D
[2016/01/03 13:18:51] <Hume2> Really?
[2016/01/03 13:18:55] <Tobbi> But actually, only to watch a play they did.
[2016/01/03 13:18:55] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/03 13:19:03] <Hume2> :D
[2016/01/03 13:19:09] <Tobbi> Hume2: Let's talk in PM.

[2016/01/03 15:07:06] @ kneekoo joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/03 15:13:03] <Hume2> I rebased it, but I have no idea why it's still here.
[2016/01/03 15:13:24] <Hume2> I could squash them.
[2016/01/03 15:13:43] <Tobbi> Don't squash.
[2016/01/03 15:13:55] <Tobbi> Hume2: Did you rebase against master?
[2016/01/03 15:14:02] <Tobbi> origin/master that is?
[2016/01/03 15:14:07] <Hume2> Yes, I did.
[2016/01/03 15:15:34] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/01/03 15:15:58] <Tobbi> oh!
[2016/01/03 15:16:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: You re-committed something, accidentally.
[2016/01/03 15:16:26] <Hume2> It looks like.
[2016/01/03 15:17:44] <Tobbi> Hume2: Can you do an interactive rebase and just remove those commits?
[2016/01/03 15:18:06] <Hume2> That's 'r' I guess.
[2016/01/03 15:18:21] <Tobbi> I think you just remove the affected line altogether.
[2016/01/03 15:20:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: Isn't that a bit dangerous? What does "re-commit" mean?
[2016/01/03 15:20:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe he committed a commit of mine with a different commit hash.
[2016/01/03 15:20:56] <Tobbi> Thus, github thinks it|s a new commit.
[2016/01/03 15:21:03] <Tobbi> Happened to me as well, can|t remember what I did, though.

[2016/01/04 14:20:02] <Tobbi> Whatever.
[2016/01/04 14:20:05] <Tobbi> Hello slackmoehrle
[2016/01/04 14:20:33] <mt> yes, hi!
[2016/01/04 14:20:52] <Tobbi> mt__: You are an org user. You know: https://www.herr-der-ringe-film.de/v3/media/galerie/herrderringe/bilder05/orkschrei-cb175334.jpg
[2016/01/04 14:21:09] <Tobbi> org is the official tld for mordor.
[2016/01/04 14:21:19] <mt> also Tobbi: I wonder if we should use SDL_ttf or FreeType when we want to use TTF fonts
[2016/01/04 14:21:36] <Tobbi> mt: I do not know. I don't have experience with either.
[2016/01/04 14:21:56] <mt> I'm wondering about how easy to implement these are (SDL_ttf might be easier considering we're using SDL) and about performance
[2016/01/04 14:22:17] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2016/01/04 14:22:33] <Tobbi> Maybe I should delegate the work to someone who knows either of them.

[2016/01/04 14:26:04] <Tobbi> Mailing list users...
[2016/01/04 14:26:15] <Tobbi> damn...all attachments are scraped.
[2016/01/04 14:26:16] <mt> what about them?
[2016/01/04 14:26:37] <Tobbi> mt: one guy just posted on the list that he sent attachments (translated po files).
[2016/01/04 14:26:50] <Tobbi> Which of course got scraped.
[2016/01/04 14:27:07] <mt> tell them to use transifex
[2016/01/04 14:27:15] <Tobbi> Yeah, no, not now.
[2016/01/04 14:27:20] <Tobbi> I am busy.
[2016/01/04 14:28:18] <slackmoehrle> So I am writing SuperTux using Cocos2d-x, I was wondering whom I could correspond with to make sure I don't infringe on anything
[2016/01/04 14:28:35] <slackmoehrle> SuperTux was the first game I ever played when I started with Linux in 1998
[2016/01/04 14:28:50] <mt> did it even exist back in 1998
[2016/01/04 14:29:00] <slackmoehrle> sorry, 2004
[2016/01/04 14:29:09] <slackmoehrle> I was thinking when I started with Slackware
[2016/01/04 14:29:13] <mt> ah, yeah it did exist then
[2016/01/04 14:29:37] <mt> I'm not sure why you're porting it to Cocos2d-x (never heard of that anyway)
[2016/01/04 14:29:57] <mt> But generally: read the license in the repo
[2016/01/04 14:29:58] <slackmoehrle> because I work there and just wanted to work on something personal
[2016/01/04 14:30:21] <mt> Unless you share it, you should probably be able to do anything what you want
[2016/01/04 14:30:43] <mt> But if you want to make your work public, just follow the license (GPL, not sure if v2 or v3+)
[2016/01/04 14:30:48] <slackmoehrle> Yes, I was thinking of putting it on GitHub.
[2016/01/04 14:30:58] <mt> might be a problem dependind on the license of Cocos2d-x
[2016/01/04 14:31:03] <slackmoehrle> yeah, good idea about the GPL.
[2016/01/04 14:31:09] <slackmoehrle> Cocos2d-x is Creative Commons
[2016/01/04 14:33:43] <mt> CC? What exactly is it then? CC is for content, not for code, right?
[2016/01/04 14:35:20] <slackmoehrle> let me double check the difference.
[2016/01/04 14:35:54] <slackmoehrle> you are right
[2016/01/04 14:36:09] <slackmoehrle> some of our stuff is Creative Commons, our Programmers Guide, as an example.
[2016/01/04 14:36:54] <Tobbi> good, giby_the_kid. Smack that kid on the mailing list down :D

[2016/01/04 14:39:34] <Tobbi> slackmoehrle: Not at all. Just someone who apparently attached po files instead of translating on transifex.

[2016/01/04 14:51:21] <Tobbi> slackmoehrle: And the mailing list removes all attachments, so we're left with nothing.

[2016/01/04 14:52:50] <slackmoehrle> @Tobbi and lol to the French comment. A comedian I saw recently did a great bit on French. To the nature of nobody is scared of thungs in Canada because they speak french.
[2016/01/04 14:53:38] <Tobbi> slackmoehrle: Since the second world war, the ship of the French have a glass bottom, in order for them to see the rest of their fleet as well.

[2016/01/05 07:22:09] <mt> (actually it's more than one build because we build with Debug and Release and with gcc and clang)

[2016/01/05 08:44:49] <mt> better if we could get the game into steam
[2016/01/05 08:45:07] <head8debian> mt: True.
[2016/01/05 08:45:11] <maths22> head8debian: Indeed.  I should be able to get addons fixed within a few days
[2016/01/05 08:45:26] <maths22> I don't think the custom cursor can be fixed into it
[2016/01/05 08:45:54] <head8debian> mt: But isn't steam very picky? Ive had no experience, have only heard things.
[2016/01/05 08:46:18] <maths22> For steam, see http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/about/?appid=765&section=faq
[2016/01/05 08:48:16] <maths22> Once I get the bugs ironed out, the winrt build should be able to be played on ARM as well (ie the msft surface)
[2016/01/05 08:48:43] <head8debian> maths22: Awesome. :)
[2016/01/05 08:48:47] <mt> We could possibly submit it to Steam if we had enough donations.
[2016/01/05 08:49:11] <maths22> mt: True-we would need $100 USD
[2016/01/05 08:50:42] <head8debian> Good grief, thats alot.
[2016/01/05 08:50:49] <head8debian> Well, alot for a game.
[2016/01/05 08:51:10] <mt> we might be able to ask http://spi-inc.org/ to help us with legal assistance of donations
[2016/01/05 08:51:14] <maths22> head8debian: It is a one-time fee to submit as many games as you want
[2016/01/05 08:51:48] <mt> head8debian: that's not even a lot if you consider there's people who sell their games on steam
[2016/01/05 08:55:14] <head8debian> mt: Yes, i do see that, but for games like Supertux its alot.
[2016/01/05 09:04:58] <mt> maths22: but shouldn't we fix that windows+intel hd issue before making it available on windows store? :P
[2016/01/05 09:05:38] <mt> ref: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/285
[2016/01/05 09:05:48] <mt> also: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/287
[2016/01/05 09:14:40] <maths22> mt: Windows store does not support OpenGL, so we have to use software rendering anyways.

[2016/01/05 11:55:10] <Tobbi> maths22: Can we combine these two travis files into one? I really hate not being able to git reset --hard origin/master when I need to.
[2016/01/05 11:58:41] <maths22> Tobbi: Yes.  I just need to do more major re-working to make that work, so I figured I would manually edit to confirm that fixing what I wanted to fix indeed fixed it
[2016/01/05 11:58:50] <maths22> We can force-push over it later
[2016/01/05 11:58:53] <Tobbi> Sounds good.
[2016/01/05 12:01:05] <mt> can't we just put all the build commands in a shell script that outputs the command and its output
[2016/01/05 12:01:19] <mt> and don't run that script if the coverity variable is set
[2016/01/05 12:01:27] <mt> and then run that script as coverity script
[2016/01/05 12:02:11] <Tobbi> "Last Build Status: In-queue. Your build is in the queue to be analyzed. There are 207 builds ahead of it."
[2016/01/05 12:02:13] <Tobbi> What?
[2016/01/05 12:02:25] <Tobbi> this certainly changed.

[2016/01/05 12:03:01] <Not-e81f> [02supertux] 03Success. The Travis CI build passed - 13https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux/builds/100384740
[2016/01/05 12:03:03] <Tobbi> This could take some time until the build is finally analyzed.
[2016/01/05 12:03:15] <maths22> mt: That is what I'm going to do
[2016/01/05 12:04:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: What do you think SuperTux's Bus Factor is? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor
[2016/01/05 12:04:19] <mt> is that a 'major re-work'
[2016/01/05 12:04:55] <maths22> mt: Just in that I need to do it on my local machine and modify multiple files
[2016/01/05 12:05:07] <maths22> (I did the test through github's web interface)
[2016/01/05 12:05:28] <mt> Silly coverity interface
[2016/01/05 12:05:37] <mt> I can't remove myself as Admin
[2016/01/05 12:05:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: I really do not know. But I think it's high. I have taught you guys enough to carry on without me. :) I have done everything, and I believe everyone else has at least a basic understanding of the other areas.
[2016/01/05 12:05:42] <mt> If I wanted to
[2016/01/05 12:06:05] <mt> Who is "landroni"?
[2016/01/05 12:06:26] <Karkus> Tobbi: Sounds good :D
[2016/01/05 12:07:00] <Tobbi> mt: Guy who helped out some time ago.
[2016/01/05 12:07:06] <Tobbi> Not sure how long he doesn't contribute anymore.
[2016/01/05 12:08:34] <mt> https://scan.coverity.com/projects/supertux-supertux?tab=analysis_settings
[2016/01/05 12:08:44] <Tobbi> mt: https://launchpad.net/~landronimirc
[2016/01/05 12:08:45] <mt> the /usr/lib/* one
[2016/01/05 12:08:56] <Tobbi> mt: These files did show up.
[2016/01/05 12:08:57] <mt> might that not break because libsupertux.a?
[2016/01/05 12:09:05] <Tobbi> Oh, I don't know.
[2016/01/05 12:09:11] <Tobbi> We'll have to see.
[2016/01/05 12:09:28] <Tobbi> mt: Wait, we're talking about source files.
[2016/01/05 12:09:32] <Tobbi> Not about libraries.
[2016/01/05 12:09:40] <maths22> Tobbi: Exactly
[2016/01/05 12:11:13] <Tobbi> If there are 207 builds ahead of it, and it hasn't changed in the 10 minutes we have been talking, that could mean the build is likely gonna take a long, long time.
[2016/01/05 12:11:15] <mt> why does it consider /usr/* then anyway? >_>
[2016/01/05 12:11:23] <Tobbi> mt: Don't ask me that.
[2016/01/05 12:11:29] <Tobbi> There are header files it took into account.
[2016/01/05 12:11:34] <maths22> Tobbi: I wonder if something is currently broken/stuck
[2016/01/05 12:11:37] <Tobbi> And displayed me issues in <memory> for example.
[2016/01/05 12:11:46] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/01/05 12:12:52] <Hume2> So I guess that I shouldn't commit anything until the build finishes, right?
[2016/01/05 12:13:04] <mt> you can, to the master branch
[2016/01/05 12:13:09] <mt> just not to coverity_scan
[2016/01/05 12:13:26] <Hume2> Oh, yes. i forgot that.
[2016/01/05 12:13:29] <Tobbi> maths22: I really don't know. And coverity doesn't have an IRC channel...
[2016/01/05 12:13:34] <Tobbi> So, maybe we should contact support.
[2016/01/05 12:13:40] <Tobbi> But I guess it's a general problem.
[2016/01/05 12:14:06] <mt> ask them on twitter?
[2016/01/05 12:14:37] <Tobbi> Yeah, possibly.
[2016/01/05 12:15:06] <maths22> By the way, on WinRT, I actually have it loading the data directory from a .zip file
[2016/01/05 12:15:10] <maths22> PhysFS is cool that way
[2016/01/05 12:16:46] <Tobbi> Wait...
[2016/01/05 12:17:01] <Tobbi> Does "We've been experiencing some trouble" imply the issues are fixed now?
[2016/01/05 12:17:05] <Tobbi> Oh.
[2016/01/05 12:17:09] <Tobbi> It probably does.
[2016/01/05 12:17:31] <Tobbi> I don't know anything about English.
[2016/01/05 12:17:39] <mt> that's already a few days old, tho
[2016/01/05 12:18:09] <Tobbi> mt: No, it's what I posted.
[2016/01/05 12:18:26] <Tobbi> I posted "@coverityScan We've been experiencing some trouble getting our build to analyze. It says there are 207 builds ahead in queue. Any ideas?"
[2016/01/05 12:18:37] <Tobbi> I suck at English :D
[2016/01/05 12:18:50] <Tobbi> Ah, never mind, they should get what I mean.
[2016/01/05 12:19:03] <Hume2> That's true.

[2016/01/05 12:20:01] <Tobbi> So we're not the only ones.

[2016/01/05 12:24:56] <maths22>  By the way, we might want to consider supporting generally keeping the data dir as a zip file
[2016/01/05 12:25:09] <maths22> It greatly reduces the disk space used by SuperTux
[2016/01/05 12:25:32] <polyphagia> it's not great for packaging though
[2016/01/05 12:25:34] <polyphagia> for win32 i'd leave it
[2016/01/05 12:26:02] <polyphagia> but in debian for instance we don't generally want packaged data assets, since we'll symlink to assets like fonts
[2016/01/05 12:26:03] <maths22> polyphagia: I was mostly thinking for regular windows builds in addition to winrt builds
[2016/01/05 12:26:05] <polyphagia> oh ok
[2016/01/05 12:26:07] <polyphagia> then yeah
[2016/01/05 12:26:32] <maths22> And also for our own self-packaged builds (the nightly ones that don't go in repos)
[2016/01/05 12:26:49] <maths22> If I pursue it, I will make it a cmake flag
[2016/01/05 12:27:01] <polyphagia> yeah that's what i ended up doing for another game i packaged
[2016/01/05 12:27:06] <polyphagia> that used zip data
[2016/01/05 12:27:19] <jesusalva> Won't loading data from inside a package make the game slower?
[2016/01/05 12:27:53] <polyphagia> i think physfs abstracts most of the performance stuff
[2016/01/05 12:27:53] <Tobbi> maths22: Hmm, we could use 7z, couldn't we?
[2016/01/05 12:28:03] <maths22> jesusalva: I would suggest we test it before using it-possibly
[2016/01/05 12:28:06] <maths22> Tobbi: Yes
[2016/01/05 12:28:13] <maths22> And see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7050997/zip-files-using-cmake
[2016/01/05 12:28:16] <polyphagia> does the game not pre-load sounds btw?
[2016/01/05 12:28:21] <maths22> We could generate it with cmake
[2016/01/05 12:28:22] <polyphagia> i notice some IO slowdown mid-game occasionally
[2016/01/05 12:28:26] <Tobbi> maths22: I mean: Does physfs support loading from 7z archives?
[2016/01/05 12:28:31] <polyphagia> sometimes it's kind of jarring
[2016/01/05 12:28:42] <maths22> Tobbi: Yes
[2016/01/05 12:28:47] <maths22> https://icculus.org/physfs/
[2016/01/05 12:28:57] <polyphagia> that would be a cool maths22 !
[2016/01/05 12:29:06] <Tobbi> That's great!
[2016/01/05 12:29:30] <Tobbi> LZMA2 might be better, though :D
[2016/01/05 12:29:35] <Tobbi> But, hey, better than nothing.
[2016/01/05 12:30:04] <polyphagia> should addons be able to use 7z then too?
[2016/01/05 12:30:20] <polyphagia> optionally, to be backwards compatable
[2016/01/05 12:30:28] <Tobbi> We could do that...
[2016/01/05 12:31:11] <maths22> Raw data dir: 116 mb
[2016/01/05 12:31:21] <maths22> zip: 78 mb
[2016/01/05 12:31:33] <maths22> 7z: 74 mb
[2016/01/05 12:31:40] <mt> zip reducing the actual file size? uh
[2016/01/05 12:31:57] <maths22> mt: ?
[2016/01/05 12:32:08] <mt> zip isn't that effective, usually
[2016/01/05 12:32:12] <maths22> And sorry-raw is actually 122
[2016/01/05 12:32:28] <maths22> mt: It mostly reduces the file size on all the text-based files
[2016/01/05 12:33:32] @ Quit: lumidify: Ping timeout: 276 seconds

[2016/01/05 12:33:53] <Tobbi> great
[2016/01/05 12:34:05] <maths22> Particularly, the levels go from 42 mb to 2 mb (roughly)
[2016/01/05 12:34:26] <Tobbi> maths22: What settings did you use?
[2016/01/05 12:34:30] <Tobbi> Can we tweak them more?
[2016/01/05 12:34:37] <maths22> Default 7zip settings for both
[2016/01/05 12:34:49] <Tobbi> maths22: So if we use "ultra" compression?
[2016/01/05 12:34:58] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/05 12:34:59] <Tobbi> Would that work?
[2016/01/05 12:35:15] @ leyyin joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/05 12:35:19] <maths22> Tobbi: I'll try it-it will probably slow down extraction when playing
[2016/01/05 12:35:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: ^
[2016/01/05 12:35:29] <Karkus> I was typing that :P
[2016/01/05 12:35:32] <maths22> Tobbi: It is using LZMA
[2016/01/05 12:35:39] <maths22> s/LZMA/LZMA2/
[2016/01/05 12:35:39] <red_bot> maths22 meant: "Tobbi: It is using LZMA2"
[2016/01/05 12:35:50] <Tobbi> maths22: Ultra is using LZMA2?
[2016/01/05 12:36:00] <Tobbi> While normal isn't?
[2016/01/05 12:36:00] <maths22> Tobbi: No-all of them are
[2016/01/05 12:36:00] <mt> what about xz?
[2016/01/05 12:36:10] <Tobbi> maths22: Then we can't use that, can we?
[2016/01/05 12:36:22] <maths22> Tobbi: Not sure-will investigate later
[2016/01/05 12:36:29] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/01/05 12:36:59] <Tobbi> I'd say since physfs was last updated in 2003 and LZMA2 was released....later than that.
[2016/01/05 12:37:53] <maths22> Tobbi: I think ZIP is probably the better choice-less CPU intensive and better supported
[2016/01/05 12:38:06] <Tobbi> might be.
[2016/01/05 12:38:28] <Tobbi> Let's see how 7z compares to zip.
[2016/01/05 12:39:01] <Tobbi> bbl, gonna buy some stuff...
[2016/01/05 12:43:00] <Hume2> Do you know that Windows 8 still hasn't WinRAR integrated?
[2016/01/05 12:43:19] <Hume2> It's really a strange system...
[2016/01/05 12:45:25] <mt> >rar
[2016/01/05 12:45:34] <mt> are people still using that?

[2016/01/05 12:49:11] <Hume2> mt: Do you know how many types of archives can Windows open itself?
[2016/01/05 12:49:20] <mt> 0, iirc
[2016/01/05 12:49:29] <Hume2> Only zip.

[2016/01/05 13:27:47] <polyphagia> Hume2: RAR is proprietary, that's partially why
[2016/01/05 13:28:13] <polyphagia> most gnulinux distros carry a couple of free versions though
[2016/01/05 13:28:22] <polyphagia> debian, for some reason, still packages the proprietary rar programs too
[2016/01/05 13:28:51] <polyphagia> but RAR is pretty much worthless imo

[2016/01/05 13:29:47] <Hume2> Well, I don't have a big knowledge about this, but it's true.
[2016/01/05 13:30:18] <polyphagia> the author of the RAR program is a real dink tbh
[2016/01/05 13:30:32] <polyphagia> he purposely updates the format to sabatoge the free versions
[2016/01/05 13:31:09] <Hume2> hmmm... interresting.
[2016/01/05 13:31:10] <polyphagia> windows' lack of support for anything besides ZIP is annoying too :P
[2016/01/05 13:31:37] <Hume2> I'm worried about how the updates are comprimated ...
[2016/01/05 13:31:46] <Hume2> ZIP I guess :D
[2016/01/05 13:31:58] <Hume2> Or none ?
[2016/01/05 13:32:16] <mt> self-extracting rar?
[2016/01/05 13:32:26] <Tobbi> urgh
[2016/01/05 13:32:34] <Hume2> That uses Narre.
[2016/01/05 13:32:47] <Hume2> He calls it "instalation".
[2016/01/05 13:32:48] <polyphagia> are you wondering how to distribute supertux for windows?
[2016/01/05 13:32:57] <polyphagia> a self extracting archive could work
[2016/01/05 13:33:12] <polyphagia> as long as it was possible to add some sort of post-script to add shortcuts
[2016/01/05 13:33:16] <Hume2> Narre tried it, so it must work.
[2016/01/05 13:33:30] <polyphagia> all it really needs to do is extract it to program files (optionally allowing the user to switch), and a checkbox for start/desktop shortcuts
[2016/01/05 13:34:33] <Hume2> That's true. SuperTux doesn't really need to vandalize registry.
[2016/01/05 13:34:43] <polyphagia> Hume2: http://www.gdgsoft.com/faq/7zsfx.htm
[2016/01/05 13:34:51] <polyphagia> >A 7-Zip Self-Extracting (SFX) archive is a stand-alone program file (Windows .exe file) that can unpack the 7z archive (stored inside it) without needing 7-Zip or any other tools. This is actually a .7z file bundled with a small program (overhead) that extracts the files directly from the merged .7z file to the folder specified by the user.
[2016/01/05 13:34:57] <Tobbi> RAR will go the same way flash does now.
[2016/01/05 13:35:16] <polyphagia> although that product looks proprietary
[2016/01/05 13:35:19] <polyphagia> i bet we could find a free one
[2016/01/05 13:35:40] <Tobbi> 7Z can create sfx files.
[2016/01/05 13:35:46] <polyphagia> well then there you go :P
[2016/01/05 13:35:53] <Tobbi> last time I checked, at least.
[2016/01/05 13:35:54] <polyphagia> i guess the only thing is shortcuts
[2016/01/05 13:36:13] <polyphagia> it would be nice if it could run a batch script after the extraction is done
[2016/01/05 13:36:17] <polyphagia> maybe it can
[2016/01/05 13:36:24] <Tobbi> wait, 7z can create sfx for windows only.
[2016/01/05 13:36:31] <polyphagia> yeah that's fine
[2016/01/05 13:36:40] <Tobbi> really?
[2016/01/05 13:36:46] <polyphagia> we can distribute it in 7z for everything else
[2016/01/05 13:36:51] <polyphagia> without the exe

[2016/01/05 14:44:57] <maths22> mt: Your "hack" is realistically the only way to get a .app without running it through CPack
[2016/01/05 14:45:13] <maths22> Homebrew should work from the command line without it
[2016/01/05 14:45:38] <mt> yeah, but homebrew can link the .app bundle to /Applications
[2016/01/05 14:46:04] <mt> and it's not possible to not build an .app bundle on OSX without a customized CMakeLists.txt
[2016/01/05 14:46:49] <maths22> mt: Then I think your "hack" is necessary
[2016/01/05 14:47:26] <mt> Is it possible to build with CPack
[2016/01/05 14:47:40] <mt> and without including these bundle libs in the .app?
[2016/01/05 14:47:48] <maths22> What bundle libs?
[2016/01/05 14:48:08] <mt> there was some libpng.dylibs that ended up in the install_prefix

[2016/01/05 15:07:10] <Tobbi> I find cmake quite advanced.
[2016/01/05 15:07:12] <Tobbi> Somehwat.
[2016/01/05 15:07:16] <Tobbi> From what I can see...
[2016/01/05 15:07:22] <mt> CMake > autotools
[2016/01/05 15:07:38] <mt> and it's much more structured

[2016/01/05 15:08:56] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2016/01/05 15:09:00] <maths22> mt: Autotools is not in my list of "fun"
[2016/01/05 15:09:15] <Tobbi> mt: So why are you saying that moving from autotools to cmake is horrible?
[2016/01/05 15:09:31] <mt> because I have to understand what autotools does first
[2016/01/05 15:09:36] <maths22> Tobbi: Probably because he needs to work through all of the autotools nonsense
[2016/01/05 15:09:43] <Tobbi> hah :D okay.

[2016/01/05 15:20:12] <maths22> (Most of it would now be implemented in c++, but is done in c because of the project's heritage)

[2016/01/05 16:26:10] <Tobbi> vs. if(!dead_script.empty())
[2016/01/05 16:26:23] <maths22> empty is more readable
[2016/01/05 16:26:35] <maths22> Not that this is unreadable, but empty makes the point more clearly
[2016/01/05 16:27:24] <Tobbi> good.
[2016/01/05 16:27:48] <Tobbi> Not sure how this looks performance wise...Actually, we're not developing for embedded devices :D

[2016/01/05 16:35:43] <leyyin> I am half joking, I tend to get overly obsesive about code style consistency
[2016/01/05 16:36:03] <leyyin> I have nightmares about reading the openssl code :P
[2016/01/05 16:36:13] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/05 16:36:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: I am obsessive about anything.
[2016/01/05 16:36:24] <Tobbi> Concerning code style.
[2016/01/05 16:36:25] <leyyin> that was/is the pinnacle of code formating hell
[2016/01/05 16:36:45] <leyyin> you can find in that codebase every code style in human history
[2016/01/05 16:37:18] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/05 16:37:25] <maths22> We should run clang-format with Google style (since we cite https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html in CODINGSTYLE)
[2016/01/05 16:37:37] <Tobbi> maths22: We should actually do that.
[2016/01/05 16:37:40] <Tobbi> can you?
[2016/01/05 16:37:50] <maths22> Tobbi: Sure...
[2016/01/05 16:38:57] <leyyin> I do not think the google style has the return type of functions on a single line
[2016/01/05 16:39:11] <leyyin> but you can generate a clang-format file based on the google style and modify that
[2016/01/05 16:41:17] <leyyin> also http://clangformat.com/
[2016/01/05 16:41:27] <Tobbi> leyyin: But what is actually faster? != "" or empty()
[2016/01/05 16:41:42] <leyyin> neither, it does not matter tbh
[2016/01/05 16:41:55] <leyyin> it's O(1)
[2016/01/05 16:42:00] <Tobbi> Good.
[2016/01/05 16:42:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: In case we develop SuperTux for pre-1989 computers...or for calculators.
[2016/01/05 16:42:22] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/05 16:44:18] <maths22> leyyin: Then we need to update CODINGSTYLE
[2016/01/05 16:45:02] <Tobbi> man, xcode is small.
[2016/01/05 16:45:05] <Tobbi> eeh slow.
[2016/01/05 16:45:16] <leyyin> visual studio is slow
[2016/01/05 16:45:16] <maths22> You are correct about that not being the Google style
[2016/01/05 16:45:18] <leyyin> huge IDE
[2016/01/05 16:45:26] <maths22> leyyin: VS is vast with an ssd :)

[2016/01/05 16:59:57] <maths22> I ran it through the formatter
[2016/01/05 17:00:54] <Tobbi> interesting :D
[2016/01/05 17:01:12] <maths22> Tobbi: What?
[2016/01/05 17:01:19] <maths22> Also, what is our brace style?
[2016/01/05 17:01:35] <maths22> We don't appear to actually follow the google standard, which is fine, except that we cite it
[2016/01/05 17:01:52] <maths22> I think before I run this more, we need to fix CODINGSTYLE to actually document what we want
[2016/01/05 17:01:57] <Tobbi> maths22: Hmm, my prof always wanted to see braces in the new line...
[2016/01/05 17:02:05] <Tobbi> other than in line with the definition, if statement etc.
[2016/01/05 17:02:19] <Tobbi> 205 builds ahead of ours.
[2016/01/05 17:02:21] <maths22> Tobbi: Interesting.

[2016/01/05 17:02:53] <Tobbi> maths22: It's interesting that the formatter formatted code in comments like a block...
[2016/01/05 17:03:13] <Tobbi> I believe.
[2016/01/05 17:03:17] <Tobbi> Or maybe I didn't look hard enough.

[2016/01/05 17:05:17] <Tobbi> Now that most of the methods are correctly marked as const, what will I next OCD about?
[2016/01/05 17:05:25] <maths22> I think function braces should be on their own line (in c++ at least)
[2016/01/05 17:05:30] <maths22> Changing...
[2016/01/05 17:05:48] <Tobbi> maths22: Yeah, that's what I learned too.
[2016/01/05 17:05:58] <Tobbi> In Java it's different.
[2016/01/05 17:07:29] <maths22> Same-I do more Java than c++, so I'm more used to same line
[2016/01/05 17:07:57] <Tobbi> leyyin: Did you notice any performance problems when playing SuperTux? Something we could try to fix?
[2016/01/05 17:08:01] <maths22> What about if, while, etc
[2016/01/05 17:08:22] <maths22> The convention is less strong one way or the other
[2016/01/05 17:08:30] <Tobbi> hmm, not sure
[2016/01/05 17:08:56] <maths22> I personally prefer same line, but it isn't very important
[2016/01/05 17:10:01] <Tobbi> I think I have been changing that in the past to the same as function style. Because OCD.

[2016/01/05 17:19:40] <leyyin> *SDL
[2016/01/05 17:20:02] <Tobbi> leyyin: What? We use SDL 2.
[2016/01/05 17:20:25] <maths22> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commit/03ceafd30deb0b5d96835ecd57eab625524e6e02
[2016/01/05 17:20:26] <leyyin> I misunderstood
[2016/01/05 17:20:55] <maths22> I'm thinking I need to allow wider lines-what do you think?
[2016/01/05 17:21:05] <leyyin> 120 column :P
[2016/01/05 17:21:24] <Tobbi> Possibly.
[2016/01/05 17:21:37] <Tobbi> Can we add a git hook that will do this automatically?
[2016/01/05 17:21:44] <maths22> Tobbi: In some way...
[2016/01/05 17:21:48] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/01/05 17:21:51] <leyyin> ahem, AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: true

[2016/01/05 17:22:30] <Tobbi> leyyin: How comes you know so much about this? I have never used that strange formatter in my life.
[2016/01/05 17:22:36] <Tobbi> I use sane things like cppcheck :D
[2016/01/05 17:22:45] <leyyin> that is a formatter?
[2016/01/05 17:22:51] <Tobbi> leyyin: no, but it's sane.
[2016/01/05 17:22:56] <maths22> leyyin: ?
[2016/01/05 17:22:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/05 17:23:02] <maths22> About AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine
[2016/01/05 17:23:04] <leyyin> well, I got annoyed at formating code by hand
[2016/01/05 17:23:13] <maths22> Can you point me to an example?
[2016/01/05 17:23:15] <Tobbi> hmm, ok
[2016/01/05 17:23:18] <leyyin> so I learned about clang-format, I remember the code at google using clang-format for formating
[2016/01/05 17:23:29] <leyyin> maths22, http://clangformat.com/
[2016/01/05 17:23:34] <maths22> Also, this commit will give me "credit" for so many lines of code!
[2016/01/05 17:23:36] <leyyin> 5'th option
[2016/01/05 17:23:43] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/05 17:23:44] <maths22> leyyin: I meant in our codebase
[2016/01/05 17:23:50] <maths22> Where it is doing the wrong thing
[2016/01/05 17:23:56] <leyyin> src/addon/addon.hpp
[2016/01/05 17:24:16] <leyyin> get_title, get_author, etc
[2016/01/05 17:24:17] <Tobbi> Hmm, we could actually hook up a cronjob to update the pot files every once in a while.
[2016/01/05 17:24:19] <maths22> Will fix
[2016/01/05 17:24:38] <maths22> Somehow it got set to "all"
[2016/01/05 17:24:47] <Tobbi> Who is willing to do that? Create a cronjob?
[2016/01/05 17:25:01] <maths22> And isn't doing anything
[2016/01/05 17:25:08] <Tobbi> An automatic way to handle translations would be a great thing.
[2016/01/05 17:25:14] <Tobbi> No more committing stuff, pushing stuff etc.
[2016/01/05 17:25:18] <leyyin> maybe because you have AlwaysBreakAfterDefinitionReturnType: true
[2016/01/05 17:25:31] <maths22> leyyin: Probably
[2016/01/05 17:25:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: ping?
[2016/01/05 17:26:01] <leyyin> anyway, it is not a big deal, the code looks nice :D
[2016/01/05 17:26:02] <maths22> leyyin: This is the full config: https://transfer.sh/lvGcg/fullconfig
[2016/01/05 17:26:16] <maths22> Before merging, I'll mess with it more tonight
[2016/01/05 17:26:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: pong.
[2016/01/05 17:26:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: What?
[2016/01/05 17:26:43] <Tobbi> head8debian: could you create a cronjob that updates l10n files...?
[2016/01/05 17:26:49] <Tobbi> for transifex, I mean?
[2016/01/05 17:27:02] <Tobbi> And probably from transifex as well?
[2016/01/05 17:27:19] <Tobbi> I meant pot files.

[2016/01/05 17:28:20] <Tobbi> How do we make working with localization easier then?
[2016/01/05 17:28:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, i don't know. We don't?
[2016/01/05 17:28:46] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2016/01/05 17:29:48] <maths22> Tobbi: Can I be added to transifex in a way that I can dowload stuff?
[2016/01/05 17:29:54] <Tobbi> One moment.
[2016/01/05 17:30:13] <leyyin> anyway, gn
[2016/01/05 17:30:33] <Tobbi> maths22: Invited you.

[2016/01/05 17:33:28] <Tobbi> We should do that.
[2016/01/05 17:33:59] <maths22> That will incent translating 100%
[2016/01/05 17:34:06] <maths22> I'll look into setting it up later
[2016/01/05 17:34:25] <maths22> We should be able to run it on the downloads.supertuxproject.org server

[2016/01/05 17:39:47] <Tobbi> both contain that makepot.sh script.
[2016/01/05 17:42:00] <maths22> Tobbi: what does makepot.sh do?
[2016/01/05 17:42:28] <Tobbi> maths22: Create translation templates from the game's contents.
[2016/01/05 17:42:38] <Tobbi> I wanted to convert that into a python script anyway.

[2016/01/06 10:13:29] <mt> it does look pretty similar to notifico but is more configurable: https://urandom.eu.org/i/nnR5CzQz.png
[2016/01/06 10:13:50] <mt> head8debian: you can run many things on a 128 MB RAM VPS
[2016/01/06 10:14:06] <head8debian> Still, $22/y  for it + a domain.
[2016/01/06 10:14:29] <head8debian> mt: True. Its pretty tight to host a website though.
[2016/01/06 10:15:14] <head8debian> Im thinking of getting a VPS for a year... thinking.
[2016/01/06 10:15:36] <mt> http://lowendspirit.com/ -> 3â¬/yr IPv6 and NAT VPS
[2016/01/06 10:15:53] <mt> they run haproxy so you can host your website under IPv4 + port 80
[2016/01/06 10:16:05] <mt> or you could just use cloudflare for that
[2016/01/06 10:17:37] <head8debian> mt: Cloudflare does what?
[2016/01/06 10:18:02] <mt> head8debian: and, it's pretty much enough for hosting a simple website with nginx (might not support PHP but eww scripted content)
[2016/01/06 10:18:47] <head8debian> mt: Well, $1 a month is not much, as a matter of fact its cheap.
[2016/01/06 10:19:06] <head8debian> Its *very* cheap.
[2016/01/06 10:19:11] <mt> head8debian: well since the LowEndSpirit VPS only support IPv6 and 20 NAT ports (not port 80), you could run the webserver on the IPv6's port 80 and make cloudflare proxy IPv4 to IPv6 (and IPv6 to IPv6)
[2016/01/06 10:19:23] <head8debian> Hrm.
[2016/01/06 10:20:25] <head8debian> 1GB disk space? o_O
[2016/01/06 10:21:18] <mt> subtract another 100 MB because ploop ;)
[2016/01/06 10:21:26] <mt> and 200 MB for the OS
[2016/01/06 10:21:36] <mt> 700 MB for a website, pretty much
[2016/01/06 10:21:45] <head8debian> Ouch.
[2016/01/06 10:22:00] <head8debian> WIll they give me a domain for 50 cents? :p
[2016/01/06 10:22:05] <mt> nope
[2016/01/06 10:22:14] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/06 10:22:21] <mt> but hey, it's enough for running a website, or what do you understand as website?

[2016/01/06 10:23:17] <mt> pentagon is the bot I'm using for the GitHub announcements :P
[2016/01/06 10:23:18] <pentagon> mt: Error: "is" is not a valid command.
[2016/01/06 10:23:21] <head8debian> Some decent HTML/CSS website without any flashy junk.
[2016/01/06 10:23:27] <head8debian> mt: COol.
[2016/01/06 10:23:33] <head8debian> 1 x NAT IPv4 ?
[2016/01/06 10:23:43] <head8debian> If its NAT, how is that supposed to work? :p
[2016/01/06 10:23:52] <mt> head8debian: yep. 20 NATed ports and 1 SSH NAT port
[2016/01/06 10:24:42] <mt> head8debian: they run a reverse proxy for serving websites on port 80 (that's a proxy that redirects HTTP(s) traffic to your VPS)
[2016/01/06 10:25:03] <mt> head8debian: or you run it on IPv6 and let CloudFlare reverse proxy both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic
[2016/01/06 10:25:12] <head8debian> Ah.
[2016/01/06 10:25:13] <mt> (https://www.cloudflare.com/)

[2016/01/06 10:25:58] <head8debian> Ive used a reverse proxy that a friend set up and he showed me how it works, a little.
[2016/01/06 10:26:23] <mt> head8debian: PM?
[2016/01/06 10:26:42] <mt> want you to do something about the announcement webhook

[2016/01/06 11:58:34] <Tobbi> Hume2: ping?
[2016/01/06 11:58:49] <Hume2> Hello, Tobbi
[2016/01/06 11:58:56] <Tobbi> Hume2: In case you haven't seen: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commit/e04ec028d91c5c4cc1c70fa6cefb70a819892e48#diff-f4868f0781e6c34b4ef6d2f0ce13a5e3L4673
[2016/01/06 11:59:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: Re-setting a tile ID to 0 will make the editor go crazy
[2016/01/06 11:59:28] <Tobbi> Because it thinks empty tiles have the storm cloud setting.
[2016/01/06 11:59:40] <Hume2> well...
[2016/01/06 12:01:08] <Hume2> Tobbi: It's an editor bug, isn't it?
[2016/01/06 12:01:17] <Tobbi> Hume2: No, it expects tile 0 to be empty.
[2016/01/06 12:01:34] <Hume2> SuperTux skips all tiles 0.
[2016/01/06 12:01:43] <Tobbi> Hume2: The editor doesn't.
[2016/01/06 12:01:48] <Tobbi> Okay, maybe it is an editor bug.
[2016/01/06 12:01:51] <Tobbi> But doesn't matter.
[2016/01/06 12:02:15] <Hume2> In my opinion, the editor should be synchrone with the SuperTux behaviour.
[2016/01/06 12:02:41] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yes, okay...  We should look into it. but for now, leave it as it is, please.
[2016/01/06 12:02:49] <Hume2> OK
[2016/01/06 12:04:06] <Hume2> Tobbi: Anyway what kind of penguin the Tux is?
[2016/01/06 12:04:15] <Tobbi> Hume2: I don't know? :D
[2016/01/06 12:04:57] <Tobbi> According to wikipedia, one of the sources of inspiration is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_penguin

[2016/01/06 12:07:40] <mt> who implemented badguy melting/burning?

[2016/01/06 12:09:06] <Hume2> I'm now trying to get how big Tux really is.
[2016/01/06 12:09:20] <Hume2> It really matters.
[2016/01/06 12:09:31] <Tobbi> Why does it matter?
[2016/01/06 12:09:58] <mt> get that value in pixels or as powerup?
[2016/01/06 12:10:14] <Hume2> It affects the melting scheme.
[2016/01/06 12:11:14] <mt> well if you know how to get the powerup status but want pixels, add a function that gets the powerup status and do a switch/case with the pixel value you previously got from GIMP
[2016/01/06 12:13:06] <Hume2> Isn't it this penguin? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_penguin
[2016/01/06 12:14:06] <Hume2> It matches the most AFAIK.

[2016/01/06 12:31:45] <mt> Hume2: how do you choose these values? are they in the code or do you calculate that from the size of that penguin and the difference in the graphics?
[2016/01/06 12:32:14] <Hume2> mt: I calculate it for this penguin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_penguin
[2016/01/06 12:33:18] <mt> ah
[2016/01/06 12:33:26] <mt> why do you need to calculate it?
[2016/01/06 12:33:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'm going to force the user to hit "Apply" in the properties widget, that's not a problem is it?
[2016/01/06 12:33:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, it's not.
[2016/01/06 12:33:47] <Tobbi> At least, I don't think it is.
[2016/01/06 12:33:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: It makes more sense than evaluating on the fly
[2016/01/06 12:34:00] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2016/01/06 12:34:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am still in favour of a widget like most IDEs have it.
[2016/01/06 12:34:16] <Tobbi> Table-like.
[2016/01/06 12:34:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: Have you ever used an IDE?

[2016/01/06 12:48:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: Sounds interesting.
[2016/01/06 12:48:27] <Tobbi> I'll check that...one moment.

[2016/01/06 12:49:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: I like the idea, though.
[2016/01/06 12:50:06] <Tobbi> Still, the OCD in me tells me to use a table view :D
[2016/01/06 12:50:11] <Tobbi> Me, too.

[2016/01/06 12:51:16] <Hume2> So the fireball must be near it's melting point.
[2016/01/06 12:51:46] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/06 12:51:47] <Tobbi> OCD?
[2016/01/06 12:51:55] <Hume2> Karkus: I want to know how much powerful the fireball is.
[2016/01/06 12:52:22] <Hume2> Tobbi: Maybe? Maybe just curiousity.
[2016/01/06 12:52:27] <Karkus> Hume2: Melting point of what?
[2016/01/06 12:52:40] <Hume2> Melting point of graphite.
[2016/01/06 12:52:56] <Karkus> Hume2: Why graphite?

[2016/01/06 12:53:20] <jesusalva> Is it fire? Or is it plasma, and the fire is the air burning near it?
[2016/01/06 12:53:25] <Hume2> It's most close to coal that I can consider.
[2016/01/06 12:53:33] <Hume2> Plasma is not so dense.
[2016/01/06 12:53:37] <Tobbi> or is it super man?
[2016/01/06 12:53:44] <jesusalva> Karkus: Enemy destroyed by fireball with highest melting point.
[2016/01/06 12:53:47] <Hume2> It would expand before hitting the enemy.
[2016/01/06 12:54:09] <Karkus> jesusalva: Ah.
[2016/01/06 12:54:22] <Karkus> jesusalva: And yet, jumpy's armour is fine!
[2016/01/06 12:54:46] * jesusalva thought it would melt the steel armor of those badguys.
[2016/01/06 12:55:16] <Karkus> jesusalva: Who said it was steel?
[2016/01/06 12:55:31] <Tobbi> Super Mario isn't physically correct either. I eat one mushroom and get tall? c'mon...
[2016/01/06 12:55:44] <jesusalva> Tobbi: It's a magica mushroom!

[2016/01/06 13:19:57] <mt> Hint for checking if it worked:
[2016/01/06 13:20:11] <mt> On the page for the webhook, there's a list of recently delivered payloads
[2016/01/06 13:20:22] <mt> check if it contains on with "action": "labeled"
[2016/01/06 13:20:43] <mt> if that was successfully sent and didn't appear here, it's ok
[2016/01/06 13:20:57] <mt> please also test commenting on an issue
[2016/01/06 13:21:04] <mt> oh nope that doesn't work
[2016/01/06 13:21:26] <mt> make it resend a payload where an issue was opened

[2016/01/06 13:21:57] <Karkus> mt: Works
[2016/01/06 13:22:04] <Karkus> I changed the labels, then commented
[2016/01/06 13:22:16] <mt> commenting is another thing actually
[2016/01/06 13:22:18] <mt> as I noticed

[2016/01/06 13:27:45] <mt> unless I change that as well
[2016/01/06 13:29:32] <Hume2> 2^24 = 16,777,216 That's easy to remember.
[2016/01/06 13:30:16] <mt> yes, the number of IPs in an IPv4 /8 subnet :D
[2016/01/06 13:30:30] <mt> 2^(32-8)
[2016/01/06 13:30:40] <Hume2> :D
[2016/01/06 13:31:08] <Hume2> wait, IPv4 / 64
[2016/01/06 13:31:21] <Hume2> Isn't it?
[2016/01/06 13:31:23] <mt> IPv4 is /32 bits complete
[2016/01/06 13:31:35] <mt> you don't have /64s there
[2016/01/06 13:31:48] <Hume2> It's 2^8.
[2016/01/06 13:31:58] <mt> a /32 is one IP (2^(32-32) = 2^0 = 1)
[2016/01/06 13:32:16] <Hume2> 2^(32-8) = 2^32 / 2^8
[2016/01/06 13:32:27] <Hume2> = 2^32 / 64
[2016/01/06 13:32:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah, I did this https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/commit/f34f43fca18a7ad11a6def3616ad57a53c9b3ee7 but somehow it wasn't committed with the other. Thanks for noticing :P
[2016/01/06 13:33:34] <mt> Hume2: something's wrong there. IPv4 doesn't have /64 subnets (just /0 (all IPs in the IPv4 space) to /32 (one single IP)
[2016/01/06 13:33:52] <mt> for IPv6, /0 is all IPv6 space, /128 is one IPv6 address
[2016/01/06 13:34:18] <mt> a /56 assignment is what's recommended by the RFC for end-users
[2016/01/06 13:34:30] <Hume2> Oh, i thought that you mean (number of IPs in an IPv4) / 8
[2016/01/06 13:34:57] <Karkus> Hume2: 2^8 != 64 8^2 = 64
[2016/01/06 13:35:13] <Hume2> Oh... my head.
[2016/01/06 13:35:20] <Hume2> It's 256.
[2016/01/06 13:35:31] <mt> also beware of ^ and computers
[2016/01/06 13:35:41] <mt> in python and ruby, ^ is XOR iirc
[2016/01/06 13:36:06] <Hume2> So may I use Unicode istead?
[2016/01/06 13:36:17] <Hume2> No problem.
[2016/01/06 13:36:18] <mt> LaTeX :D

[2016/01/06 13:37:54] <Hume2> Better?
[2016/01/06 13:38:02] <Karkus> Hume2: How do you do that?
[2016/01/06 13:38:08] <Hume2> Unicode.
[2016/01/06 13:38:26] <Karkus> But hau
[2016/01/06 13:38:31] <Karkus> how*
[2016/01/06 13:38:32] <mt> Menu-^-8 on my computer â¸ â¥
[2016/01/06 13:39:20] <Karkus> mt: What OS?
[2016/01/06 13:39:38] <mt> Arch Linux, GNOME
[2016/01/06 13:39:53] <mt> that's DE and display server-dependent
[2016/01/06 13:40:03] <mt> on Linux you call it Compose
[2016/01/06 13:40:13] <Hume2> I've just copied it from Unicode table :P
[2016/01/06 13:40:34] <mt> on Linux: man Compose and man XCompose
[2016/01/06 13:40:59] <mt> Hume2: yeah, that's ok for single use
[2016/01/06 13:41:10] <mt> however I use the en_UK keyboard
[2016/01/06 13:41:42] <mt> but also need to type German Umlauts (I'm German) and French accents (I write some French from time to time)
[2016/01/06 13:42:12] @ Quit: Tobbi: Remote host closed the connection
[2016/01/06 13:42:16] <mt> so I can simply use menu key-"-a which produces Ã¤
[2016/01/06 13:42:33] <mt> or Ã¡ is menu key-'-a
[2016/01/06 13:42:46] <mt> and Ã¨ is menu key-`-e
[2016/01/06 13:43:08] <mt> much easier than copying from a unicode table
[2016/01/06 13:43:28] <Hume2> I use Czech keyboard.
[2016/01/06 13:43:32] <Hume2> And AltGr.
[2016/01/06 13:44:10] <Hume2> I just can't write Ã.
[2016/01/06 13:44:21] <Hume2> on Czech keyboard.
[2016/01/06 13:44:22] <mt> Ã is menu key-s-s here
[2016/01/06 13:44:36] <mt> and Å¾ is menu key-v-z :D
[2016/01/06 13:44:54] <mt> as long as it isn't CJK I have to type
[2016/01/06 13:45:00] <mt> it works
[2016/01/06 13:45:14] <Hume2> Menu key doesn't seem to work for writing on my machine.
[2016/01/06 13:45:26] <mt> yeah, I've configured it to be menu key
[2016/01/06 13:46:06] <mt> In GNOME 3.18 it's in 'Settings' -> 'Keyboard' -> 'Shortcuts' -> 'Typing' -> 'Compose key'
[2016/01/06 13:46:20] <Hume2> I'll look.
[2016/01/06 13:47:39] <Hume2> It works, thanks!

[2016/01/07 08:51:53] <polyphagia> like the ones from the original smb that would leap out of the water at a curve
[2016/01/07 08:52:03] <polyphagia> the ones in supertux just go up and down

[2016/01/07 08:54:51] <mt> and fishes - on land or in the air? I don't know
[2016/01/07 08:55:13] <polyphagia> the two aren't mutually exclusive mt :P was just expanding on an idea somebody else posted there
[2016/01/07 08:56:08] <polyphagia> but yeah a cheep-cheep-like enemy for underwater levels for sure
[2016/01/07 08:56:13] <snadge> the things i hate about supertux when i first started playing it... turn out to be some of its redeeming features
[2016/01/07 08:56:30] <polyphagia> personally though i never really liked the water levels so i hope supertux can make them more fun :P
[2016/01/07 08:57:13] <jesusalva> polyphagia: An airplane which drops snowballs.
[2016/01/07 08:57:27] <jesusalva> :/
[2016/01/07 08:57:33] <snadge> the excessive sliding.. the diving flying things.. what are they called?
[2016/01/07 08:57:37] <polyphagia> there was a cloud in one level that dropped "hail" (mricecubes)
[2016/01/07 08:57:45] <mt> jesusalva: we do have the owls which can carry objects
[2016/01/07 08:57:47] <jesusalva> You're walking them a SnowBall comes from air to bother you.
[2016/01/07 08:57:49] <snadge> the bullfrogs can be aggravating too
[2016/01/07 08:58:06] <mt> speaking of owls, they do need a graphics update
[2016/01/07 08:58:19] <snadge> also when you kill the yeti.. wtf is with that graphic
[2016/01/07 08:58:29] <polyphagia> yeah owls too
[2016/01/07 08:58:46] <jesusalva> Maybe we already have lots of mobs. :/
[2016/01/07 08:59:24] <snadge> i agree with cheep cheep like thing.. that could be cool.. underwater swimming.. yeah.. meh
[2016/01/07 08:59:24] <jesusalva> snadge: I also hate the excessive sliding. I cannot do most of levels where you have to land on a 1x1 square.
[2016/01/07 08:59:58] <snadge> i got used to it though.. i've finished nearly every level thats been contributed
[2016/01/07 09:00:09] <snadge> some of those levels are really quite difficult
[2016/01/07 09:01:16] <jesusalva> snadge: I think the yeti graphic might be suit for children.
[2016/01/07 09:02:15] <snadge> i also dont really get the purpose of the ice flower
[2016/01/07 09:02:40] <snadge> its way less useful than the fire flower
[2016/01/07 09:03:25] <Tobbi> Uhm, we have a meeting the day after tomorrow...
[2016/01/07 09:03:30] <Tobbi> Maybe this can be discussed then.
[2016/01/07 09:04:42] <jesusalva> Oh right. Nearly forgot. But umm, isn't an IRC channel meant for this anyway?
[2016/01/07 09:05:14] <Tobbi> okay, maybe.
[2016/01/07 09:05:22] <Tobbi> Just meant to discuss this.
[2016/01/07 09:05:58] <jesusalva> Yes. Right now we might as well be writting what we'll say on the meeting,
[2016/01/07 09:06:05] <Tobbi> sure

[2016/01/07 10:48:54] <head8debian> 68 issues!?!? Good grief...
[2016/01/07 10:48:57] * head8debian faints...
[2016/01/07 10:49:00] <head8debian> ;p
[2016/01/07 11:05:17] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why did you faint?
[2016/01/07 11:16:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: ;) We only had 20 issues a week ago. ;)
[2016/01/07 11:17:01] <head8debian> Or 2 weeks ago.
[2016/01/07 11:17:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: More like a month ago.
[2016/01/07 11:17:22] <Tobbi> head8debian: Reporting issues is the easiest way...
[2016/01/07 11:17:37] <Tobbi> to contribute, I mean.
[2016/01/07 11:17:47] <mt> do we need http://supertuxproject.org/authors.html
[2016/01/07 11:19:28] <mt> also Tobbi did you add the webhook for pentagon to htdocs and SuperTux.github.io?
[2016/01/07 11:19:40] <Tobbi> mt: I didn't. Did you tell me to?
[2016/01/07 11:19:55] <mt> yes
[2016/01/07 11:20:04] <Tobbi> oh, no, I did not.
[2016/01/07 11:20:09] <Tobbi> mt: What do I need to do?
[2016/01/07 11:20:37] <mt> Tobbi: go to 'Settings' -> 'Webhooks & services'
[2016/01/07 11:20:56] <mt> you'll see the n.tkte.ch one, set it to inactive (untick Active in the settings)
[2016/01/07 11:21:18] <mt> then add a new one, http://fornax.urandom.eu.org:33399/github
[2016/01/07 11:21:26] <mt> with these settings: https://urandom.eu.org/i/jb09xGDC.png
[2016/01/07 11:21:40] <mt> application/x-www-form-urlencoded is important
[2016/01/07 11:23:33] <mt> Tobbi: addons is also whitelisted
[2016/01/07 11:23:39] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2016/01/07 11:23:42] <mt> can add more repos if you want to
[2016/01/07 11:23:50] <Tobbi> mt: I do need a secret, don't I?
[2016/01/07 11:24:00] <mt> no
[2016/01/07 11:24:07] <mt> it validates the GitHub IPs
[2016/01/07 11:24:13] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/01/07 11:25:17] <Tobbi> I just triggered a redelivering event.
[2016/01/07 11:25:45] <mt> what's it supposed to redeliver?

[2016/01/07 11:26:59] <Tobbi> okay.
[2016/01/07 11:27:01] <Tobbi> alright
[2016/01/07 11:27:39] <mt> so, I only see two recent ping events
[2016/01/07 11:27:46] <mt> did you add htdocs and addons as well
[2016/01/07 11:28:13] <Tobbi> I am on it.
[2016/01/07 11:28:17] <Tobbi> gimme a break, damn it.
[2016/01/07 11:30:40] <Tobbi> Okay, should be done.
[2016/01/07 11:31:00] <mt> yeah, seems to be there
[2016/01/07 11:33:56] <maths22> mt: That descritption was pulled from cmakelists.txt
[2016/01/07 11:34:19] <maths22> My primary concern right now is getting the program running
[2016/01/07 11:34:39] <mt> indeed
[2016/01/07 11:34:53] <mt> someone apparently forgot to update that

[2016/01/07 11:48:23] <Tobbi> Might work well for things like, I don't know, Karnevalsfeste.

[2016/01/07 13:05:09] <mt> actually not
[2016/01/07 13:05:21] <mt> wait 4 weeks
[2016/01/07 13:05:23] <mt> then it will be
[2016/01/07 13:05:29] <Hume2> I'm Hume2 on GitHub as well.
[2016/01/07 13:06:46] <Hume2> mt: I'm now thinking about water physics implementation.
[2016/01/07 13:07:46] <mt> make all physics real :D
[2016/01/07 13:08:07] <mt> btw what's the mass of 1 tile snow
[2016/01/07 13:08:27] <mt> and 1 tile earth?
[2016/01/07 13:08:35] <Hume2> Well, it's width is 40cm .
[2016/01/07 13:09:01] <mt> let's assume a=b=c
[2016/01/07 13:09:01] <Hume2> It depends on the snow density...
[2016/01/07 13:09:09] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/01/07 13:09:41] <mt> http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Icy-Ecosystems/Looking-closer/Snow-and-ice-density
[2016/01/07 13:10:46] <Hume2> It's settled snow I guess.
[2016/01/07 13:11:01] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/01/07 13:11:03] <Tobbi> pun.
[2016/01/07 13:11:44] <Hume2> So mass of 1tile of settled snow is 16kg.
[2016/01/07 13:12:34] <Hume2> The Earth's average density is about 5600kg/mÂ³.
[2016/01/07 13:12:43] <mt> 3.84 kg on the top
[2016/01/07 13:12:48] <Hume2> OK
[2016/01/07 13:13:42] <Tobbi> Guys...
[2016/01/07 13:13:50] <Tobbi> ... w h y ?
[2016/01/07 13:14:03] <Hume2> So when the denstity of earth is 3840kg/mÂ³, one tile's mass is 246kg.
[2016/01/07 13:14:18] <mt> 32.96 kg for 1 tile of tunnel snow
[2016/01/07 13:14:46] <Hume2> What density did you counted with?
[2016/01/07 13:15:15] <mt> Firn, (400+830)/2 = 515 kg/m^3
[2016/01/07 13:15:31] <mt> s/^3/Â³/
[2016/01/07 13:15:31] <red_bot> mt: You did something wrong... Try s/you/me/ or tell me "help sed"
[2016/01/07 13:15:42] <Hume2> I've just calculated it myself :P
[2016/01/07 13:16:06] <Hume2> Firn is the sharp snow, isn't it?
[2016/01/07 13:16:12] <mt> "Granular and partially compacted snow that has passed through one summerâs melting season but has not yet turned to glacial ice."
[2016/01/07 13:16:19] <mt> according to that site I linked to
[2016/01/07 13:16:42] <Hume2> Yes, it's that sharp snow.
[2016/01/07 13:16:56] <Hume2> It's dangerous to slip on it.
[2016/01/07 13:17:32] <mt> oh we don't have to forget that m(photon) = 0 # always
[2016/01/07 13:17:55] <mt> so, but to talk about swimming
[2016/01/07 13:18:23] <mt> it would be interesting to be able to define the viscosity of the liquids
[2016/01/07 13:18:42] <mt> possibly also the volatility
[2016/01/07 13:18:54] <Hume2> Yes, but I think it depends on the algorithm we'll use.
[2016/01/07 13:28:27] <polyphagia> is there an issue for XDG dirs?
[2016/01/07 13:29:49] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/294 ?
[2016/01/07 13:31:19] <polyphagia> hm this isn't XDG though
[2016/01/07 13:31:21] <polyphagia> it's just a dotfile in ~
[2016/01/07 13:31:32] <polyphagia> XDG would be ~/.config/ and ~/.local/
[2016/01/07 13:31:45] <polyphagia> ~/.local/share/supertux would be for addons, ~/.config/supertux/ for config
[2016/01/07 13:31:51] <polyphagia> but XDG has environmental variables
[2016/01/07 13:31:59] <polyphagia> http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.6.html
[2016/01/07 13:34:18] <mt> I know
[2016/01/07 13:34:23] <mt> I also proposed that
[2016/01/07 13:34:35] <polyphagia> oh
[2016/01/07 13:34:42] <mt> But that's apparently not possible as apparently physfs can only handle one directory
[2016/01/07 13:34:53] <polyphagia> does supertuxkart not use it?
[2016/01/07 13:34:55] <polyphagia> hm
[2016/01/07 13:34:56] <mt> We'd have to re-implement that with boost's FS libs oslt
[2016/01/07 13:35:04] <polyphagia> well
[2016/01/07 13:35:13] <polyphagia> how is it working now?
[2016/01/07 13:35:22] <polyphagia> it has to load from /usr/share as well as ~/.supertux2
[2016/01/07 13:35:53] <polyphagia> physfs also doesn't need to touch config
[2016/01/07 13:36:00] <polyphagia> just ~/.local/share/supertux
[2016/01/07 13:37:29] <mt> I think right now we we're using ~/.supertux2 as sole config/addon dir
[2016/01/07 13:37:59] <mt> polyphagia: we also need a dir layout for config because profile?
[2016/01/07 13:38:18] <mt> where '?' is a wildcard
[2016/01/07 13:38:21] <polyphagia> oh yeah
[2016/01/07 13:42:36] <Hume2> The real water physics would also reveal the real hitboxes.
[2016/01/07 13:43:10] <Tobbi> hitboxes can be debugged from the console.
[2016/01/07 13:43:17] <Tobbi> debug_collrects(true)
[2016/01/07 13:46:50] <Hume2> The problem is in that in almost all cases hitbox != shape.
[2016/01/07 13:47:27] <Hume2> ...becase the shape is usually not rectangular, while the hitbox always is.
[2016/01/07 13:48:52] <Tobbi> Hume2: We do not strive for exactness...
[2016/01/07 13:49:05] <mt> why can't we have shaped hitboxes?
[2016/01/07 13:49:12] <Tobbi> mt: Why do we need to?
[2016/01/07 13:49:38] <polyphagia> they're slower :P
[2016/01/07 13:49:42] <Tobbi> mt: Are you actually serious?
[2016/01/07 13:49:56] <Tobbi> You sound like he who must not be named.
[2016/01/07 13:50:06] <polyphagia> haha
[2016/01/07 13:50:23] <Hume2> Tobbi: Then explain me this: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/320
[2016/01/07 13:50:37] <mt> nah
[2016/01/07 13:50:44] <mt> we don't need real physics
[2016/01/07 13:50:52] <Tobbi> Hume2: Okay, but I didn't write that bug.
[2016/01/07 13:51:09] <Hume2> Neither I need real physics.
[2016/01/07 13:51:29] <Hume2> However some of those points require that.
[2016/01/07 13:52:42] <Hume2> Anyway just because of this I revealed how fast computers we really have: http://madebyevan.com/webgl-water/
[2016/01/07 13:55:14] <Hume2> It's not as good quality though.
[2016/01/07 14:00:00] <Karkus> mt: We probably should.
[2016/01/07 14:00:09] <Karkus> Hume2: We don't need proper physics
[2016/01/07 14:00:13] <Karkus> Or water
[2016/01/07 14:00:43] <Karkus> Just an animation which is generalised, and will work without graphics people putting in backwork
[2016/01/07 14:00:56] <Karkus> Or LMH complaining
[2016/01/07 14:01:25] <Hume2> So make sprites for each terrain case?
[2016/01/07 14:01:36] <Karkus> Hume2: Why?
[2016/01/07 14:01:47] <Hume2> You've just said it.
[2016/01/07 14:02:06] <Karkus> Hume2: Why would it be different regarding the terrain?
[2016/01/07 14:02:11] <Hume2> Or how do you imagine generalized animation?
[2016/01/07 14:02:36] <Karkus> Hume2: Fade + water appears + splash/drop?
[2016/01/07 14:03:06] <Hume2> That I suggested before, but Tobbi didn't like it.
[2016/01/07 14:03:18] <Tobbi> oh, don't you blame me.
[2016/01/07 14:03:22] <Tobbi> As I said: I am not your leader.
[2016/01/07 14:03:22] <mt> Karkus: what should we probably do?
[2016/01/07 14:03:29] <Tobbi> Do whatever you want with the project and I'll comply.
[2016/01/07 14:03:42] <Karkus> mt: Regarding which of the many matters?
[2016/01/07 14:04:17] <mt> re 20:00:00 <@Karkus> mt: We probably should.
[2016/01/07 14:04:34] <Hume2> When Tobbi doesn't like it, I guess that he won't be the only one.
[2016/01/07 14:04:41] <Karkus> mt: Have shaped hitboxes :p
[2016/01/07 14:04:53] <Hume2> Well...
[2016/01/07 14:04:54] <Tobbi> Hume2: Listen: You sound like I am influencing people...
[2016/01/07 14:04:58] <Tobbi> I am trying not to.
[2016/01/07 14:05:15] <Hume2> oh...
[2016/01/07 14:05:16] <Tobbi> If you want, I can stop contributing, and you guys can take matters into your own hands.
[2016/01/07 14:05:25] <Tobbi> Since everyone knows basically everything...
[2016/01/07 14:05:29] <Tobbi> It's not a big loss.
[2016/01/07 14:05:38] <Tobbi> SuperTux has seen many people come and go over the years.

[2016/01/07 14:06:43] <Hume2> I don't know why.
[2016/01/07 14:06:52] <Tobbi> Hume2: Maybe because I am too demanding.

[2016/01/07 14:09:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: You need some confidence. Want to lead the project? :P
[2016/01/07 14:10:07] <Hume2> I would be a terrible lead I think.
[2016/01/07 14:10:55] <Tobbi> Hume2: I don't technically lead the project either.
[2016/01/07 14:11:01] <Tobbi> You just regard me as lead since I know a lot.
[2016/01/07 14:11:16] <Tobbi> What's that called? Meritocracy?
[2016/01/07 14:11:23] <Karkus> Tobbi, Hume2: Currently, no-one is lead. It's fine that way, can't we all be happy?
[2016/01/07 14:11:35] <Tobbi> Yes, these discussions can get tiring.
[2016/01/07 14:11:55] <Tobbi> I just don't want people to take my opinion as somewhat more important than anyone else's.

[2016/01/07 14:13:18] <Hume2> It looks like I can't resist, I'm really sorry.
[2016/01/07 14:15:00] <Hume2> It shouldn't mean anything I hope, only some Tobbi'o'arguments.

[2016/01/07 16:17:31] <Tobbi> To have an alert or not have an alert.

[2016/01/07 16:35:56] <Karkus> polyphagia: What do you mean?
[2016/01/07 16:36:03] <polyphagia> for public editing
[2016/01/07 16:36:04] <polyphagia> on github
[2016/01/07 16:36:25] <Karkus> polyphagia: They can, but unfortunately this is often abused.
[2016/01/07 16:36:32] <polyphagia> how so?
[2016/01/07 16:36:39] <polyphagia> i think github has some more failsafes in place
[2016/01/07 16:36:42] <Karkus> polyphagia: Vandalism?
[2016/01/07 16:36:56] <Karkus> polyphagia: For example? ^^
[2016/01/07 16:37:06] <polyphagia> you still need a github account
[2016/01/07 16:37:10] <polyphagia> you can ban a vandal
[2016/01/07 16:37:21] <polyphagia> it's not the easiest to make bot accounts on github
[2016/01/07 16:37:35] <polyphagia> it's a big service, they've handled being ddos'd by baidu :P
[2016/01/07 16:37:58] <Karkus> polyphagia: Why were they Ddos d?
[2016/01/07 16:38:23] <Karkus> s/s d/s'd/
[2016/01/07 16:38:23] <red_bot> Karkus meant: "polyphagia: Why were they Ddos'd?"
[2016/01/07 16:38:36] <polyphagia> somebody hosted a tool on github to get around the great firewall
[2016/01/07 16:38:52] <Karkus> polyphagia: Oh, I think I heard about that.
[2016/01/07 16:38:53] <polyphagia> and so supposedly the chinese government put a bit of javascript on baidu that would make repeated requests to the page
[2016/01/07 16:38:57] <leyyin> china is not playing nice?
[2016/01/07 16:38:59] <leyyin> socker

[2016/01/07 16:39:05] <polyphagia> this was a while ago
[2016/01/07 16:39:41] <polyphagia> meh if vandalism was a problem with the github wikis then best to leave it as is then
[2016/01/07 16:39:54] <Karkus> leyyin, mt, Tobbi: What do you know about GitHub wikis?
[2016/01/07 16:40:02] <Karkus> And spamming, and the like
[2016/01/07 16:40:39] <leyyin> that I am good at spamming
[2016/01/07 16:40:54] <Karkus> polyphagia: Just a minute, let me ban leyyin first

[2016/01/07 18:25:05] <jesusalva> Finally done, and you get a negative? How unlucky.
[2016/01/07 18:26:06] <jesusalva> Make sure coverity isn't the Brazilian Ecologic Control (or whatever takes care of nature). They take 6 months to deny your request because you forgot to declare a root on the plant you want to cut down.

[2016/01/08 11:32:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: what're they saying?
[2016/01/08 11:35:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: They denied my request to take over maintainance of the page, thats it.
[2016/01/08 11:36:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did they update the page to 0.4.0 in the mean time?
[2016/01/08 11:38:58] <maths22> Tobbi: It actually makes the download the right size-whenever you want use the current one
[2016/01/08 11:39:13] <maths22> It does not appear to actually download all 200+ mb
[2016/01/08 11:39:25] <Tobbi> I see...
[2016/01/08 11:39:33] <Tobbi> So I guess I will fire up my Windows PC and try it out.

[2016/01/08 12:14:02] <mt> right
[2016/01/08 12:14:08] <mt> I also prefer dark colorschemes

[2016/01/08 12:15:30] <maths22> (The irc client)
[2016/01/08 12:16:32] <mt> it's not an irc client actually, it's a matrix.org client, vector.im (also that URL), which is connected via a matrix <-> IRC bridge (M-mteufel)
[2016/01/08 12:18:56] <Tobbi> My VM needs to be updated as well.

[2016/01/08 12:27:29] <mt> oh you're using weechat?
[2016/01/08 12:29:31] <mt> maths22: what's badly implemented in that IRC bridge is that it doesn't use NAMES to pre-fetch all the users in a channel; what's bad about matrix is that apparently no one had the idea that people might want to change their email (you can add new ones, but don't delete old ones) >_>

[2016/01/08 12:45:25] <polyphagia> it renders every curses app better than the defaults though that's for sure
[2016/01/08 12:45:34] <polyphagia> all of the colours contrast very nicely together :D

[2016/01/08 14:28:28] <Hume2> Why are there the M- clones?
[2016/01/08 14:28:40] <mt> because.
[2016/01/08 14:29:00] <mt> they're bridges to matrix.org, something IRC-like

[2016/01/08 14:29:31] <polyphagia> is matrix proprietary? :P
[2016/01/08 14:29:34] <Hume2> Never heard about this.
[2016/01/08 14:29:42] <polyphagia> oo looks interesting
[2016/01/08 14:29:42] <mt> also you could use matrix.org (https://vector.im has a nicer client than the actual matrix.org one) to stay connected when your computer isn't on
[2016/01/08 14:29:46] <polyphagia> no it's not if anybody was wondering
[2016/01/08 14:29:48] <mt> polyphagia: it's opensource
[2016/01/08 14:29:59] <mt> even the reference implementation, not just the standard
[2016/01/08 14:30:47] <polyphagia> yeah
[2016/01/08 14:30:55] <polyphagia> interesting
[2016/01/08 14:30:59] <polyphagia> will look more into it soon
[2016/01/08 14:34:19] <mt> one can also get rid of the M- prefix
[2016/01/08 14:36:35] <mt> you'd send `!nick irc.freenode.net yournickhere` to `@appservice-irc:matrix.org`

[2016/01/08 19:17:57] <Tobbi> yay.
[2016/01/08 19:18:03] <Tobbi> jesusalva: I can't.
[2016/01/08 19:18:06] <Tobbi> Not in my might.
[2016/01/08 19:18:40] <jesusalva> There are days that Manaplusbot posts no less than 100 messages, and it must wait 3 seconds between one and other because of flood protection.
[2016/01/08 19:20:38] <Tobbi> Hmm, coverity tells me the build is already in for analysis.

[2016/01/08 19:36:59] <Tobbi> Coverity build is working fine now, by the way.
[2016/01/08 19:37:40] <maths22> Great!
[2016/01/08 19:37:43] <Tobbi> And it's showing us errors in include files.
[2016/01/08 19:37:49] <Tobbi> Which we can't control.
[2016/01/08 19:38:12] <maths22> I'll look more closely later
[2016/01/08 19:39:02] <Tobbi> maths22: Re the windows build, I hope. There's nothing you can do about coverity.
[2016/01/08 19:39:14] <Tobbi> I'm glad they didn't report any errors, I was expecting many more of them.

[2016/01/08 19:58:49] <head8debian> Hrm, im thinking of writing a page on my website about IRC eloquete... We will see how far i get.
[2016/01/08 20:00:20] <head8debian> jesusalva: Sound like a good idea? :D Now if we could only get Tobbi to follow it...
[2016/01/08 20:01:01] <jesusalva> Sorry head8debian, what is a "eloquete"?
[2016/01/08 20:08:41] <head8debian> jesusalva: eloquent*. Meaning to tell what shoudl be said and shouldn't. You should look up the definition. ;)
[2016/01/08 20:08:51] * head8debian misspelt it...
[2016/01/08 20:09:52] <jesusalva> head8debian: You'll end up with #supertux-dev and #supertux, and on the end miscellaneous off-topic chat will happen on both channels.
[2016/01/08 20:10:44] <jesusalva> Is natural of humans to remember misc. subjects at random times.
[2016/01/08 20:10:54] <jesusalva> Off-topic is inevitable.

[2016/01/08 20:12:19] <head8debian> jesusalva: I realize that, but IRC talk could be cleaner, if you know what i mean.
[2016/01/08 20:12:28] <head8debian> And Tobbi shows up when i bid him. :p
[2016/01/08 20:12:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: Hello.
[2016/01/08 20:13:00] <head8debian> jesusalva: So thats why im thinking of writing a page on it...
[2016/01/08 20:13:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: What did you want from me?
[2016/01/08 20:14:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
[2016/01/08 20:14:08] <Tobbi> huh? ok
[2016/01/08 20:14:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why do you want to write a page on IRC (?) eloquete(?)
[2016/01/08 20:15:06] <Tobbi> Talking about etiquette?
[2016/01/08 20:15:10] <jesusalva> head8debian: The problem is, off-topic is necessary. Although sometimes it's undesirable (like during the meetings) it's whats strengthen bonds between developers and make us a team.
[2016/01/08 20:15:23] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2016/01/08 20:15:23] <Tobbi> I agree.
[2016/01/08 20:15:30] <head8debian> jesusalva: Im not against that at all. Maybe i said this wrong...
[2016/01/08 20:15:39] <jesusalva> Possibly.
[2016/01/08 20:15:45] <Tobbi> As long as people don't socialize too much... or are annoying *cough* that special person *cough*
[2016/01/08 20:15:51] * head8debian *facepalm*...
[2016/01/08 20:15:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D:D
[2016/01/08 20:16:04] <jesusalva> Tobbi: I created a special ignore filter.
[2016/01/08 20:16:22] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/08 20:17:11] <jesusalva> And besides, even if I ignored you Tobbi (by example!), if I think too weird the people talking I could check logfiles...
[2016/01/08 20:17:46] <Tobbi> >D
[2016/01/08 20:17:47] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/08 20:17:48] <Tobbi> Indeed.
[2016/01/08 20:17:50] <head8debian> But it could benifit people who are new to IRC, and how to talk.
[2016/01/08 20:18:02] <Tobbi> So, this will be for this channel, right?
[2016/01/08 20:18:05] <head8debian> Especially support questions.
[2016/01/08 20:18:13] <head8debian> No, a rough draft for every IRC channel....
[2016/01/08 20:18:25] <head8debian> You shall see when i am done. :D
[2016/01/08 20:18:25] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/01/08 20:19:08] <jesusalva> I'm not sure. It's already awkward enough the idea to talk with the devs of your favorite game for the first time (ever)
[2016/01/08 20:19:09] <Tobbi> We haven't gotten any more stars recently.
[2016/01/08 20:19:29] <Tobbi> jesusalva: People just don't talk with us :P
[2016/01/08 20:19:51] <jesusalva> Tobbi: As expected. If you want more stars, dress up like Tux, write 'Play supertux, it's free' and take a trip by the city.
[2016/01/08 20:19:53] <jesusalva> :P
[2016/01/08 20:20:02] <head8debian> jesusalva: :p
[2016/01/08 20:20:10] <head8debian> jesusalva: You would do that well! :D
[2016/01/08 20:20:15] <Tobbi> jesusalva: People would think I am {weird}
[2016/01/08 20:20:17] <head8debian> :-)
[2016/01/08 20:20:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: You are. :D
[2016/01/08 20:20:27] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am not weird.
[2016/01/08 20:20:29] <Tobbi> Apple pie.
[2016/01/08 20:21:07] <jesusalva> Tobbi: If you pay for the outfit
[2016/01/08 20:21:09] <polyphagia> lol the FSF had somebody dress up as a GNU and hand out fliers at a microsoft store
[2016/01/08 20:21:25] <Tobbi> jesusalva: Uhm? me? I'm a poor college student.
[2016/01/08 20:21:33] <jesusalva> polyphagia: That's marketing.
[2016/01/08 20:21:37] <jesusalva> Tobbi: I'm underaged. I win.
[2016/01/08 20:21:43] <polyphagia> the best sort :P
[2016/01/08 20:21:53] <polyphagia> nothing says use this product like an adorable mascot
[2016/01/08 20:22:04] <Tobbi> jesusalva: *sigh*
[2016/01/08 20:22:12] <polyphagia> Tobbi: are you old enough to drink german beer?
[2016/01/08 20:22:12] * jesusalva studied marketing along everything you need to know to manage a bussiness
[2016/01/08 20:22:27] <Tobbi> polyphagia: *cough* I am 26
[2016/01/08 20:22:31] <polyphagia> oh ok
[2016/01/08 20:22:37] <polyphagia> in germany i think the drinking age is 13?
[2016/01/08 20:22:42] <Tobbi> lol.
[2016/01/08 20:22:42] <polyphagia> :P
[2016/01/08 20:22:45] <Tobbi> 16 for beer I think.
[2016/01/08 20:22:50] <Tobbi> Or did they up that?
[2016/01/08 20:22:53] * Tobbi checks
[2016/01/08 20:22:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: Good grief, IIRC its 21 here. Good for us. :D
[2016/01/08 20:23:03] <polyphagia> in russia, beer wasn't considered alcoholic until 2008 :P
[2016/01/08 20:23:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: 50 for you.
[2016/01/08 20:23:09] <polyphagia> 18 here
[2016/01/08 20:23:10] <head8debian> polyphagia: Hah.
[2016/01/08 20:23:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: I wish.
[2016/01/08 20:23:21] <jesusalva> See? Off topic already, head8debian.
[2016/01/08 20:23:35] <jesusalva> :P
[2016/01/08 20:23:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am proud to say that I never smoked.
[2016/01/08 20:23:41] <Tobbi> Never even tried.
[2016/01/08 20:24:11] <head8debian> Yay... as if its worse than drinking.
[2016/01/08 20:24:16] <polyphagia> never smoked tobacco
[2016/01/08 20:24:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: It is.
[2016/01/08 20:24:24] <polyphagia> well
[2016/01/08 20:24:27] <polyphagia> not an entire cigar/cigarette
[2016/01/08 20:24:28] <Tobbi> polyphagia: *sigh*... the other stuff is bad too.
[2016/01/08 20:24:37] <Tobbi> If I get what you're implying.
[2016/01/08 20:24:41] <polyphagia> why Tobbi ?
[2016/01/08 20:24:55] <Tobbi> polyphagia: If we're talking about pot: It changes your behaviour.
[2016/01/08 20:25:02] <polyphagia> i get the attitude in europe's a bit different than here though
[2016/01/08 20:25:04] <Tobbi> I'd not dare touch that thing.
[2016/01/08 20:25:07] <jesusalva> Tobbi: both will kill you later. Drinking will destroy your sugar-absorbation and neurological capacity. Normal smoke destroy your lungs and neurological system.
[2016/01/08 20:25:16] <polyphagia> that's scare-tactic marketing Tobbi
[2016/01/08 20:25:19] <head8debian> jesusalva: Precisely.
[2016/01/08 20:25:20] <Tobbi> jesusalva: I do not drink often...
[2016/01/08 20:25:23] <polyphagia> it doesn't change you any more than alcohol does
[2016/01/08 20:25:32] <head8debian> jesusalva: Nots not great on the liver though. :)
[2016/01/08 20:25:34] <polyphagia> if anything, less so
[2016/01/08 20:25:36] <head8debian> Its not*
[2016/01/08 20:25:45] <head8debian> jesusalva / Tobbi*.
[2016/01/08 20:25:45] <Tobbi> polyphagia: What if I decided to stay away from anything I consider suspicious?
[2016/01/08 20:25:51] * head8debian facepalms again...
[2016/01/08 20:25:52] <polyphagia> that's your perogative :P
[2016/01/08 20:25:58] <Tobbi> exactly.
[2016/01/08 20:26:21] <polyphagia> it's doing yourself a favour if anything. it's pretty awesome so i'd rather not know what i'm missing :P
[2016/01/08 20:26:32] <polyphagia> than be missing it
[2016/01/08 20:26:46] <Tobbi> polyphagia: 1) It's illegal here in Germany.
[2016/01/08 20:26:49] <polyphagia> but truth be told i'm more productive with that and coffee than anything else
[2016/01/08 20:27:10] <polyphagia> it's mandated to be legal here within the next year or so
[2016/01/08 20:27:13] <polyphagia> country-wide
[2016/01/08 20:27:17] * jesusalva looks at how we left the topic to speak about beer and tabaco.
[2016/01/08 20:27:22] <polyphagia> we'll be the first first-world country to legalize it :P
[2016/01/08 20:27:24] <jesusalva> Is that on your page, head8debian?
[2016/01/08 20:27:28] <polyphagia> of course
[2016/01/08 20:28:00] <Tobbi> polyphagia: where exactly do you come from again? Canada?
[2016/01/08 20:28:04] <polyphagia> yeag
[2016/01/08 20:28:07] <polyphagia> yeah*
[2016/01/08 20:28:31] <head8debian> polyphagia: Your a canadian. My second one on IRC to meet. :D
[2016/01/08 20:28:36] <head8debian> Canadian*
[2016/01/08 20:28:41] <head8debian> Where in Canada?
[2016/01/08 20:28:48] <polyphagia> the middle :P
[2016/01/08 20:28:50] <polyphagia> manitoba
[2016/01/08 20:29:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: Have you ever tried smoking *anything*, whether it's tobacco or weed?
[2016/01/08 20:29:50] <polyphagia> tobacco gave me a headache and i never wanted it again
[2016/01/08 20:30:27] <polyphagia> yuck
[2016/01/08 20:30:48] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I know that weed can cause a decrease in mental capacity.
[2016/01/08 20:31:06] <Tobbi> If I take that one example that I know of.
[2016/01/08 20:31:09] <polyphagia> as in how much you're able to process at once?
[2016/01/08 20:31:48] <polyphagia> i mean it's kind of the idea to inebriate you lol. i'm not saying it doesn't, it's just not as severe as you're probably thinking
[2016/01/08 20:31:58] <jesusalva> As in general. You modify the neurons structure.
[2016/01/08 20:32:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: No i havent. I cannot stand the smoke from our woodstove anyways, so i doubt it would be and better.
[2016/01/08 20:32:14] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Probably? I am also talking about your ability to remember things.
[2016/01/08 20:32:17] <head8debian> That was half-sarcastic. ;)
[2016/01/08 20:32:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: I think this is good.
[2016/01/08 20:32:27] <Tobbi> but, that|s only my opinion.
[2016/01/08 20:32:29] <head8debian> any*
[2016/01/08 20:32:39] <polyphagia> i've blacked out with alcohol a couple of times
[2016/01/08 20:32:49] <polyphagia> never with anything else
[2016/01/08 20:32:52] <head8debian> polyphagia: But drinking gives you a hangover, whats any better about that?
[2016/01/08 20:33:01] <polyphagia> not blaming alcohol, it was my responsibility. but i'm just saying
[2016/01/08 20:33:05] <head8debian> that would give you a bad headache.
[2016/01/08 20:33:17] <head8debian> So is a headache from cigarettes.
[2016/01/08 20:33:18] <polyphagia> head8debian: marijuana gives you a better sleep :P
[2016/01/08 20:33:22] <polyphagia> no headaches or hangovers
[2016/01/08 20:33:24] <Tobbi> I know that so many people smoke weed... but I am happy with my life as it is without it.
[2016/01/08 20:33:25] <polyphagia> no throwing up
[2016/01/08 20:33:35] <polyphagia> just a good night's sleep
[2016/01/08 20:33:45] <head8debian> And brain damage.
[2016/01/08 20:33:47] <polyphagia> not even passing out, just comfortable
[2016/01/08 20:33:49] <polyphagia> no lol
[2016/01/08 20:33:56] <head8debian> Yes, not LOL.
[2016/01/08 20:33:57] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I know that many people use weed to drown their problems.
[2016/01/08 20:34:01] <polyphagia> there is no evidence of any sort of brain damage from marijuana use
[2016/01/08 20:34:01] <Tobbi> I am not willing to do that.
[2016/01/08 20:34:11] <polyphagia> oh of course but people drown their problems with all sorts of things
[2016/01/08 20:34:19] <polyphagia> plenty of people drink but not everybody drinks to drown problems
[2016/01/08 20:34:43] <head8debian> Do you think any chemical that gives you a headache is doing any good for your body? Headaches are not a natural thing.
[2016/01/08 20:34:46] <polyphagia> marijuana isn't even a great "tool" for that sort of thing anyway. it doesn't make you forget like alcohol
[2016/01/08 20:34:57] <polyphagia> marijuana doesn't give you headaches
[2016/01/08 20:34:57] <head8debian> But its addictive.
[2016/01/08 20:35:02] <polyphagia> marijuana isn't addictive
[2016/01/08 20:35:31] <polyphagia> it's unhealthy to abuse anything when you're feeling depressed. it's very easy to latch onto anything that makes you feel good
[2016/01/08 20:35:59] <head8debian> never mind, i can see this convorsation going anywhere.
[2016/01/08 20:36:06] <polyphagia> i'm not trying to be too dismissive
[2016/01/08 20:36:09] <head8debian> Precisely.
[2016/01/08 20:36:10] <Tobbi> Maybe if I had friends, I would've done it as well.
[2016/01/08 20:36:11] <polyphagia> but there is just a lot of misinformation
[2016/01/08 20:36:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: I'm glad you haven't.
[2016/01/08 20:36:25] <polyphagia> i'm not even trying to suggest any of you do it
[2016/01/08 20:36:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: Me too.
[2016/01/08 20:36:33] <jesusalva> I'm on "marijuana country". So yeah, there is. Just visit a few streets near where I lived.
[2016/01/08 20:36:41] <head8debian> polyphagia: Im definatley *NOT* GOING TO DO IT.
[2016/01/08 20:36:43] <polyphagia> where do you live jesusalva ?
[2016/01/08 20:36:47] <head8debian> Oops, caps.
[2016/01/08 20:36:49] <polyphagia> that's good head8debian :P
[2016/01/08 20:36:57] <polyphagia> i said that about a lot of things when i was younger but meh
[2016/01/08 20:37:08] <polyphagia> i guess i'm not as good of a person as i thought i'd turn out to be
[2016/01/08 20:37:12] <polyphagia> better in some ways
[2016/01/08 20:37:13] <Tobbi> polyphagia: How old are you, if I may ask?
[2016/01/08 20:37:17] <head8debian> Ive heard people that have broken out of their habits of using it, and i will trust their word over your word. ;)
[2016/01/08 20:37:20] <jesusalva> Brazil. :P
[2016/01/08 20:37:22] <polyphagia> 18 Tobbi
[2016/01/08 20:37:25] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/01/08 20:37:41] <head8debian> When you were younger? GOod grief, your barely 18.
[2016/01/08 20:37:56] <Tobbi> polyphagia: What defines a good person?
[2016/01/08 20:37:59] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/08 20:38:06] <head8debian> polyphagia: When you get to be 50 i hope you don't look back and regret doing stuff like that.
[2016/01/08 20:38:08] <polyphagia> oh boy i'm not about to get into that haha
[2016/01/08 20:38:11] <polyphagia> not sure
[2016/01/08 20:38:14] <Tobbi> Also, those ancient attributions of bad and good...
[2016/01/08 20:38:21] <Tobbi> It's so overrated.
[2016/01/08 20:38:21] <jesusalva> ...
[2016/01/08 20:38:24] <polyphagia> oh no head8debian i don't think so
[2016/01/08 20:38:27] <polyphagia> it's fairly normal
[2016/01/08 20:38:33] <polyphagia> more kids here smoke pot than cigarettes my age
[2016/01/08 20:38:33] <head8debian> I think so.
[2016/01/08 20:38:36] <Tobbi> refugees = bad, we germans = good...
[2016/01/08 20:38:50] <Tobbi> that's many people's opinions here in Germany.
[2016/01/08 20:38:51] <polyphagia> lol Tobbi it's a big deal for canada to be bringing in 25000 by februrary
[2016/01/08 20:39:05] <head8debian> You all eventually reach an age where doing what everyone else does brings us to the end of ourselves.
[2016/01/08 20:39:09] <Tobbi> polyphagia: You|'ll handle it.
[2016/01/08 20:39:12] <polyphagia> that's not even close to enough Tobbi
[2016/01/08 20:39:17] <polyphagia> we need to be bringing in way more
[2016/01/08 20:39:19] <polyphagia> and faster
[2016/01/08 20:39:26] <polyphagia> canada is huge, we have lots of resources to deal with them
[2016/01/08 20:39:35] <polyphagia> i'm disappointed we weren't acting faster
[2016/01/08 20:39:40] <Tobbi> polyphagia: So is Germany....
[2016/01/08 20:39:56] <polyphagia> germany brought more than canada plans to by february in a day
[2016/01/08 20:39:59] <polyphagia> lol
[2016/01/08 20:40:04] <Tobbi> polyphagia: But so many people are against refugees...
[2016/01/08 20:40:09] <Tobbi> here, especially.
[2016/01/08 20:40:12] <polyphagia> i know Tobbi i've been reading on reddit
[2016/01/08 20:40:14] <polyphagia> and it disheartens me
[2016/01/08 20:40:17] <Tobbi> There is a lot of prejudice against them...
[2016/01/08 20:40:24] <Tobbi> Makes me angry...
[2016/01/08 20:40:45] <jesusalva> Refugees = Unknow people of unknow localization => FLAG_UNKNOW => default: set_hostile()
[2016/01/08 20:40:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: It makes me angry what ISIS is doing and we just sit here.
[2016/01/08 20:40:47] <polyphagia> same Tobbi
[2016/01/08 20:41:03] <head8debian> jesusalva: Hold off on the code. ;)
[2016/01/08 20:41:07] <Tobbi> jesusalva: You are right... But people here don't want to change...
[2016/01/08 20:41:09] <head8debian> jesusalva: :D
[2016/01/08 20:41:10] <polyphagia> head8debian: no, just sitting here isn't what we should be doing. we should be saving the people who are going to be killed or recruited by ISIS
[2016/01/08 20:41:17] <polyphagia> instead of leaving people there to die or join them
[2016/01/08 20:41:26] <head8debian> polyphagia: Yay, we agree on something.
[2016/01/08 20:41:27] <polyphagia> while we bomb their infastractures and do nothing
[2016/01/08 20:41:30] <polyphagia> it's sad
[2016/01/08 20:41:35] <head8debian> polyphagia: Very.
[2016/01/08 20:41:44] <jesusalva> May I do a question?
[2016/01/08 20:41:55] <jesusalva> What is the objective of this discussion?
[2016/01/08 20:41:56] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I am also sad that Germany is sending weapons to those countries.
[2016/01/08 20:42:00] <Tobbi> I mean: WTF?
[2016/01/08 20:42:04] <head8debian> polyphagia: And our president doesn't seem to take anything seriously. Spends more time playing golf. :p
[2016/01/08 20:42:28] <head8debian> jesusalva: Its called discuss what we want evening it seems.
[2016/01/08 20:42:31] <jesusalva> Oh well. head8debian, ours is not popular enough to do anything
[2016/01/08 20:42:36] <jesusalva> And she say strange things
[2016/01/08 20:42:50] <head8debian> She?
[2016/01/08 20:43:02] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Fact is: I am neither for or against refugees. I don't see them as a homogenous group. There undoubtedly are some strange and even violent ones...
[2016/01/08 20:43:08] <Tobbi> And some terrorists amongst them, too.
[2016/01/08 20:43:23] <polyphagia> wait head8debian where are you from?
[2016/01/08 20:43:30] <jesusalva> Like: "I salute the manioc", "When we do a ball like this one we turn into homo sapiens and homa sapiens"
[2016/01/08 20:43:35] <jesusalva> head8debian: Yes, she.
[2016/01/08 20:43:38] <Tobbi> But, if we look at the individual...Someone who has just come to Germany to find a home...well...
[2016/01/08 20:43:44] <polyphagia> Tobbi: well i'm absolutely for them. i would rather canada accept as many as possible
[2016/01/08 20:43:45] <head8debian> jesusalva: Who is 'she'?
[2016/01/08 20:43:56] <jesusalva> Dilma.
[2016/01/08 20:43:59] <head8debian> polyphagia: As long as they share your views.
[2016/01/08 20:44:05] <head8debian> jesusalva: Im confused.
[2016/01/08 20:44:06] <polyphagia> of course they could be terrorists, but so could anybody
[2016/01/08 20:44:20] <polyphagia> domestic terrorists are more dangerous and prevalent
[2016/01/08 20:44:20] <head8debian> polyphagia: Precisely.
[2016/01/08 20:44:21] <Tobbi> polyphagia: many People here in Germany are like "they take away our jobs"...
[2016/01/08 20:44:26] <head8debian> Eh.
[2016/01/08 20:44:30] <Tobbi> and "they have smartphones so they must be rich"
[2016/01/08 20:44:33] <polyphagia> THEY TOOK 'R JOBS
[2016/01/08 20:44:42] <polyphagia> lol yeah Tobbi something i hear here often
[2016/01/08 20:44:47] <polyphagia> "canada wasn't even their first choice"
[2016/01/08 20:44:50] <polyphagia> how do you know?!
[2016/01/08 20:45:09] <polyphagia> personally if my home was just airbombed, i don't think i'd care where i am as long as it's safe
[2016/01/08 20:45:31] <polyphagia> oh well
[2016/01/08 20:45:34] * jesusalva calls an airstrike to polyphagia's home
[2016/01/08 20:45:42] <polyphagia> xenophobes will always exist
[2016/01/08 20:45:43] <polyphagia> and always have
[2016/01/08 20:45:43] <jesusalva> :P
[2016/01/08 20:45:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: Thats what some of us Americans say about Mexicans. Well, we wont get down on our knees and be payed $11 an hour for manual work, no, us stuck up americans have to have $50 an hour for our work or not work at all.
[2016/01/08 20:46:02] <Tobbi> polyphagia: But I think that there are other factors...Maybe it's not the refugees at all...Just that merkel allowed them all in without even discussing the matter.
[2016/01/08 20:46:08] <head8debian> The way this country is...
[2016/01/08 20:46:10] <polyphagia> when the irish came to canada in the late 1800s, people said they would brainwash our children with catholisicm and all of them were terrorists
[2016/01/08 20:46:26] <jesusalva> head8debian: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilma_Rousseff
[2016/01/08 20:46:42] <polyphagia> :P jesusalva
[2016/01/08 20:46:43] <Tobbi> And voters, especially from the older generation are thinking "Wait a second, I want to have influence on the political system, I am a fine German, and I have achieved so many things, like a proper job and a lot of money, I want my opinion to be heard"
[2016/01/08 20:46:59] <polyphagia> yeah Tobbi it's fair
[2016/01/08 20:47:18] <polyphagia> here was a different story. we had an election before the refugees came, and one of the promises of the new prime minister was to bring over refugees
[2016/01/08 20:47:22] <head8debian> jesusalva: Ah.
[2016/01/08 20:47:24] <polyphagia> so people clearly wanted it here
[2016/01/08 20:47:31] <Tobbi> Okay, so that's good.
[2016/01/08 20:47:36] <polyphagia> they won by a landslide
[2016/01/08 20:47:47] <polyphagia> not just because of that issue, mind you
[2016/01/08 20:47:49] <polyphagia> but it was a big deal
[2016/01/08 20:48:03] <Tobbi> polyphagia: At new years eve where I was, there was even a woman hugging some of them who were there. That's what I'd consider overkill...
[2016/01/08 20:48:05] <polyphagia> but yeah we're still not taking in nearly as much as germany
[2016/01/08 20:48:09] <polyphagia> haha
[2016/01/08 20:48:12] <polyphagia> maybe
[2016/01/08 20:48:17] <polyphagia> here we gave some hockey tickets Tobbi
[2016/01/08 20:48:25] <Tobbi> I mean I talked with some of them, they sounded alright...as far as I could understand them, so I tolerate them...
[2016/01/08 20:48:40] <Tobbi> But I wouldn't get any more affectionate towards them as the regular german would to foreigners.
[2016/01/08 20:48:50] <Tobbi> We just live our lifes. :)
[2016/01/08 20:48:59] <polyphagia> well i mean they are refugees, some of them could've seen some pretty gruesome stuff
[2016/01/08 20:49:04] <polyphagia> a hug might not be totally uncalled for
[2016/01/08 20:49:19] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I know. But let's not forget we're Germans...
[2016/01/08 20:49:20] <jesusalva> Tobbi: Then come to Brazil, redefine your idea of 'foreign' and come back there with a changed heart.
[2016/01/08 20:49:29] <polyphagia> i'm not really sure what that entails but ok Tobbi :P
[2016/01/08 20:49:33] <polyphagia> germans don't hug often or?
[2016/01/08 20:49:35] <polyphagia> haha
[2016/01/08 20:49:43] <jesusalva> Japanese doesn't.
[2016/01/08 20:49:53] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I'm in northern germany and we're cold and distanced. But only until you know us better.
[2016/01/08 20:50:19] <Tobbi> We have a barrier: acquaintance - friend.
[2016/01/08 20:51:33] <jesusalva> Tobbi Baa.
[2016/01/08 20:51:54] <polyphagia> ah alright Tobbi
[2016/01/08 20:52:47] <head8debian> jesusalva: baa? /join ##goats. :p
[2016/01/08 20:52:56] <Tobbi> polyphagia: This summarized northern Germany perfectly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdO4ligN77s
[2016/01/08 20:53:21] <Tobbi> Oh god, that channel EXISTS?
[2016/01/08 20:53:26] <jesusalva> head8debian: Baa. (Fades down and sleeps peacefully 'cause it's midnight already)
[2016/01/08 20:53:34] <jesusalva> Tobbi: Yes
[2016/01/08 20:53:41] <head8debian> :D
[2016/01/08 20:54:24] <polyphagia> Tobbi: was the bartender out of that brand of beer?
[2016/01/08 20:54:38] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Yes.
[2016/01/08 20:54:41] <polyphagia> yay
[2016/01/08 20:54:44] <polyphagia> i understood it
[2016/01/08 20:54:52] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/08 20:54:59] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I think he never had it in the first place.
[2016/01/08 20:55:14] <Tobbi> okay, one more thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBX2QQHlQ_I
[2016/01/08 20:56:40] <polyphagia> kk
[2016/01/08 20:59:23] <polyphagia> Tobbi: which accent do you prefer hearing? english or american? :P
[2016/01/08 20:59:54] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Actually...I don't really know. I can handle both of them...I did an internship at Mozilla in california, so my own accent is somewhat a mix between those two.
[2016/01/08 21:00:04] <Tobbi> And I speak American English most of the time, b/c of habit.
[2016/01/08 21:00:15] <polyphagia> haha excel'd himself :P
[2016/01/08 21:00:17] <polyphagia> ah alright
[2016/01/08 21:05:03] <polyphagia> yeah
[2016/01/08 21:05:34] <polyphagia> that video's a great intro explanation to computer image display Tobbi
[2016/01/08 21:05:56] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I agree... Matt Parker is so funny. He does a lot of videos for numberphile.
[2016/01/08 21:06:01] <polyphagia> OH
[2016/01/08 21:06:03] <polyphagia> that's where he's  from
[2016/01/08 21:06:28] <polyphagia> yeah i've seen a lot of numberphile videos
[2016/01/08 21:32:51] <pentagon> [10supertux] 07NikkOfTime commented on issue 09#303: Glitch/Bug in "A fork in the road". 13http://git.io/vEDQ5
[2016/01/08 21:33:30] <polyphagia> Tobbi: how much time does your public education spend on ww2?
[2016/01/08 21:33:41] <polyphagia> and what do they discuss
[2016/01/08 21:34:05] <Tobbi> polyphagia: We had it to quite some extent in the 11th (?) grade
[2016/01/08 21:34:12] <polyphagia> but never earlier?
[2016/01/08 21:34:21] <Tobbi> Are you afraid they might teach us propaganda?
[2016/01/08 21:34:24] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/08 21:34:34] <polyphagia> haha no i was just wondering what they covered. it was kind of a big deal here
[2016/01/08 21:34:43] <polyphagia> grade 6 they showed us all the gorey movies and everything
[2016/01/08 21:34:48] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I don't really remember how extensively we had it in school.
[2016/01/08 21:34:53] <Tobbi> sorry.
[2016/01/08 21:35:05] <polyphagia> no it's ok i was just curious
[2016/01/08 21:36:33] <polyphagia> it's ok Tobbi we have our own guilt to worry about :P
[2016/01/08 21:37:13] <Tobbi> polyphagia: To be honest: It is not our guilt anymore. We, as in, the people who currently live here, never experienced WW2, nor did they have any influence.
[2016/01/08 21:37:18] <polyphagia> oh yeah
[2016/01/08 21:37:32] <polyphagia> for sure
[2016/01/08 21:37:36] <polyphagia> i was being semi-ironic

[2016/01/08 21:37:41] <Tobbi> :) it's fine.
[2016/01/08 21:37:44] @ pentagon joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/08 21:37:45] <polyphagia> just because it's dwelled on so much
[2016/01/08 21:40:52] <Tobbi> polyphagia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz9w8pTZZE
[2016/01/08 21:45:13] <polyphagia> haha Tobbi
[2016/01/08 21:46:09] <polyphagia> yes
[2016/01/08 21:46:46] <Tobbi> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PELL2bQ6lts
[2016/01/08 21:46:54] <Tobbi> But the song is in German.
[2016/01/08 21:47:56] <polyphagia> do you mostly watch german media Tobbi ?
[2016/01/08 21:48:07] <Tobbi> I exclusively watch German media.
[2016/01/08 21:48:17] <Tobbi> Anyway, I need to go now. 4am.
[2016/01/08 21:48:24] <polyphagia> kk gnight friend
[2016/01/08 21:48:40] <Tobbi> "friend"
[2016/01/08 21:48:46] <polyphagia> it's canadian Tobbi
[2016/01/08 21:48:53] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/01/08 21:48:55] @ Quit: Tobbi: Remote host closed the connection
[2016/01/08 21:49:03] <polyphagia> it means close acquaintance
[2016/01/08 21:49:08] <polyphagia> :P
[2016/01/08 21:49:21] <polyphagia> haha
[2016/01/08 21:51:30] <jesusalva> polyphagia: For me as well. Or even less than 'close', just a person who you met and talked to sometimes is sufficient to call 'friend'.
[2016/01/08 21:51:35] <jesusalva> Most of times.
[2016/01/08 21:51:58] <polyphagia> lol yeah it was a joke on south park that canadians referred to people as "buddy" and "friend"
[2016/01/08 21:51:59] <polyphagia> but we do!
[2016/01/08 21:52:06] <polyphagia> "thanks, bud"
[2016/01/08 21:52:08] <polyphagia> to any body
[2016/01/08 21:52:10] <polyphagia> haha
[2016/01/08 21:52:28] <polyphagia> and "guy"
[2016/01/08 21:52:43] <polyphagia> i don't mind it
[2016/01/08 21:53:01] <polyphagia> no honour in being unfriendly
[2016/01/08 21:54:56] <polyphagia> so you're 16 jesusalva ?
[2016/01/08 21:55:49] <jesusalva> polyphagia: Same here. Thanks dude.

[2016/01/08 22:07:05] <jesusalva> 01AM already? Good night pal -- I meant, polyphagia.
[2016/01/08 22:07:29] <polyphagia> goodnight close acquaintance jesusalva
[2016/01/08 22:07:35] <polyphagia> i won't dare call you friend as to not offend you
[2016/01/08 22:07:47] <jesusalva> polyphagia: Calling me friend will never offend me.
[2016/01/08 22:08:16] <jesusalva> We brazilians are so much or more friendly than canadians (in general, there are exceptions as always)
[2016/01/08 22:08:49] <jesusalva> Quoting your own words: "no honour in being unfriendly"
[2016/01/08 22:09:53] <jesusalva> polyphagia: Only germans tend to be like this. And Japanese. And a few others are in general more distant one from each other.
[2016/01/08 22:10:53] <head8debian>  Good evening jesusalva.
[2016/01/08 22:11:00] <jesusalva> Now, tracking all countries would be very tiresome, so just remember the exceptions and act naturally. Being friendly is part of you. If you try to don't be, you might change yourself and became a different person.
[2016/01/08 22:11:03] <head8debian> jesusalva: You should probably go to bed. :)
[2016/01/08 22:11:08] <jesusalva> Good night head8debian, polyphagia
[2016/01/08 22:11:11] <polyphagia> haha jesusalva yeah i know i'm just joshing you
[2016/01/08 22:11:12] <polyphagia> don't worry
[2016/01/08 22:11:14] <polyphagia> you're my friend :)
[2016/01/08 22:11:17] <polyphagia> good night
[2016/01/08 22:11:22] <head8debian> 'Night all.

[2016/01/09 03:45:30] <mt> so much backlog
[2016/01/09 03:45:37] <mt> won't bother reading it
[2016/01/09 03:45:47] <Zombie> Can I ask if Feature Requests are availible?
[2016/01/09 03:46:10] <Zombie> I'd like to know if there will ever be a 2-player Simultanious Option.
[2016/01/09 03:46:27] <Zombie> either using local controllers, or a network Stack.
[2016/01/09 03:47:31] <mt> hello!
[2016/01/09 03:47:39] <mt> well, you can of course request a feature
[2016/01/09 03:48:11] <mt> however, I think, networked/local multiplayer will have to wait, there's some other, more important tasks I guess
[2016/01/09 03:48:26] <mt> unless someone wants to help us with coding that
[2016/01/09 03:53:23] <mt> maths22: the Windows Store version seems to work (have only tested Picnic with Penny tho), when I first opened it the size of the displayed content and the window size varied, so there was a black border inside the window

[2016/01/09 09:20:28] <head8debian> Welcom polyphagia.
[2016/01/09 09:20:45] <head8debian> Karkus: He is linked to my account, but he is not hurting anything by being op'ed.
[2016/01/09 09:24:27] <Karkus> Any preferences where we should start? https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/292
[2016/01/09 09:25:10] <giby> let's say we wait the starting time
[2016/01/09 09:25:25] <Tobbi> 30 minutes.
[2016/01/09 09:26:21] <Tobbi> Karkus: I'd assume that "QPainter::begin: Painter already active" has probably nothing to do with the traceback after.
[2016/01/09 09:26:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's probably caused by the crash
[2016/01/09 09:27:01] <Tobbi> oh, yeah, probably.
[2016/01/09 09:27:05] <mt> #292 > - [ ] Water physics? Melting/Burning/Freezing animations?
[2016/01/09 09:27:10] <giby> Who put a voice on ultimategiby?
[2016/01/09 09:27:11] <mt> isn't one part of that already done
[2016/01/09 09:27:18] <mt> giby: that was me
[2016/01/09 09:27:50] <mt> seems to be you, and voice can't do anything bad
[2016/01/09 09:28:22] <Karkus> But, wouldn't he have been opped?
[2016/01/09 09:28:31] <giby> mt: Have you put just a +v or auto +V ?
[2016/01/09 09:28:45] <mt> a manual /mode #supertux +v ultimategiby
[2016/01/09 09:29:08] <Tobbi> mt: The graphics need to be revised...
[2016/01/09 09:29:19] <Tobbi> It's a shame that Hume2 isn't here.
[2016/01/09 09:29:28] <mt> Tobbi: ah, well let's wait
[2016/01/09 09:29:32] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/01/09 09:29:37] <giby> Karkus, mt: as it is unregister it should not be auto-op else anyone could use it and get voice in the chanel
[2016/01/09 09:29:41] <mt> I guess Hume2 could still show up
[2016/01/09 09:29:57] <Karkus> giby: We know :D
[2016/01/09 09:30:12] <mt> giby: manually doing so won't affect anyone else in the future
[2016/01/09 09:30:24] <giby> yes...
[2016/01/09 09:30:44] <mt> and I thought: seems to be a giby clone, let's set +v for this connection
[2016/01/09 09:30:47] <Tobbi> Google Calendar just sent me an e-mail about the meeting.
[2016/01/09 09:30:53] <Tobbi> so...
[2016/01/09 09:31:06] <ultimategiby> I am my clone
[2016/01/09 09:31:16] <mt> what's the problem then?
[2016/01/09 09:31:29] <Karkus> mt: What exactly is pentagon by the way?
[2016/01/09 09:31:36] <ultimategiby> that's fine
[2016/01/09 09:31:37] <mt> Karkus: a bot

[2016/01/09 09:31:50] <Tobbi> successor
[2016/01/09 09:32:17] <mt> Karkus: `/whois mt mt` and then `/whois pentagon pentagon`
[2016/01/09 09:32:27] <mt> and you'll see whose
[2016/01/09 09:32:53] <Tobbi> mt: I would've still liked to have something open to all team members. There's no such thing, is there?
[2016/01/09 09:32:56] <Karkus> mt: So, how much control do you have over him?
[2016/01/09 09:33:22] <mt> it's running https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria + https://github.com/ProgVal/Supybot-plugins/tree/master/GitHub + custom style config
[2016/01/09 09:33:25] <Karkus> s/him/them/
[2016/01/09 09:33:25] <red_bot> Karkus meant: "mt: So, how much control do you have over them?"
[2016/01/09 09:33:40] <mt> Karkus: I'm able to do everything with that bot
[2016/01/09 09:33:50] <Karkus> mt: Hosted where?
[2016/01/09 09:33:54] <mt> I could `systemctl --user disable --now supybot@pentagon`
[2016/01/09 09:33:59] <mt> on my server
[2016/01/09 09:34:06] <mt> In London, UK at Linode
[2016/01/09 09:34:27] <Karkus> mt: Can you, for example, set up instant logging?
[2016/01/09 09:34:43] <Karkus> mt: Instead of 15 minute delay + download text file?
[2016/01/09 09:34:46] <mt> can but don't want to waste even more space for IRC logs
[2016/01/09 09:34:58] <Karkus> mt: What do you mean?
[2016/01/09 09:35:08] <head8debian> I probably will be in and out over the next hour.
[2016/01/09 09:35:28] <mt> Karkus: I already have those IRC logs...
[2016/01/09 09:35:30] <mt> 436M irclogs/
[2016/01/09 09:35:38] <mt> 3.8G .weechat/logs/
[2016/01/09 09:36:02] <mt> 315M log/
[2016/01/09 09:36:08] <Tobbi> We could use a different service...
[2016/01/09 09:36:26] <Tobbi> for logs.
[2016/01/09 09:36:27] <mt> we could ask OSUOSL
[2016/01/09 09:36:29] <mt> for hosting
[2016/01/09 09:37:10] <Tobbi> I think SuperTux is well known enough...
[2016/01/09 09:37:17] <mt> http://osuosl.org/services/hosting/details http://osuosl.org/services/hosting/policy
[2016/01/09 09:37:56] <Tobbi> mt: What about those e-mail addresses @supertuxproject.org?
[2016/01/09 09:38:19] <mt> if maths22 sets the MX of supertuxproject.org I'll be able to set up forwarding, I guess
[2016/01/09 09:38:36] <Tobbi> okay.
[2016/01/09 09:39:30] <mt> would probably still prefer to do that on an OSUOSL server
[2016/01/09 09:40:22] @ Quit: lumidify: Ping timeout: 256 seconds
[2016/01/09 09:41:00] <Tobbi> Do what's best.
[2016/01/09 09:42:41] <mt> btw, I think we still need to find a second founder for the channel
[2016/01/09 09:42:54] <mt> because +Oo is still very limited
[2016/01/09 09:43:50] <Tobbi> Talk to giby in that aspect.
[2016/01/09 09:43:59] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/09 09:44:13] <mt> you probably don't want to be founder, do you?
[2016/01/09 09:45:49] <Tobbi> mt: I could be, I guess I will still be around for some time...
[2016/01/09 09:45:57] <Tobbi> even though I said I won't be...
[2016/01/09 09:46:02] <ultimategiby> mt, why would me need it?
[2016/01/09 09:46:57] <mt> giby, ultimategiby: because there might be new contributors and you aren't always around
[2016/01/09 09:47:24] <mt> and in case of a channel emergency with a takeover +Oo isn't enough
[2016/01/09 09:47:49] <Tobbi> mt: Should we add a note to the downloads page that Linux people can download binary packages from their distribution's repositories?
[2016/01/09 09:48:00] <mt> Tobbi: +1
[2016/01/09 09:48:33] <Tobbi> Otherwise, people using Linux will complain about "Why can't I download the game, it's just available for Windows and Mac"
[2016/01/09 09:48:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: Can you do that?
[2016/01/09 09:48:42] <giby> If a contrib is actif enough, I'll figure that out... anyway adding a privilege to anyone is after concertation with others
[2016/01/09 09:49:41] <giby> The founders right is big and more people get it more we risk issues...
[2016/01/09 09:49:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: Except, it's not on the Ubuntu repos...
[2016/01/09 09:49:54] <Tobbi> Karkus: uh? Why not?
[2016/01/09 09:50:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: I can't find it...
[2016/01/09 09:50:10] * Tobbi checks
[2016/01/09 09:50:10] <Karkus> Actually, let me check
[2016/01/09 09:50:14] <mt> giby: then add some people with +Aeiotvf
[2016/01/09 09:50:20] <mt> that is *not* founder
[2016/01/09 09:51:15] <Tobbi> What access level do I currently have?
[2016/01/09 09:51:28] <mt> that is +A: view ACL, +e: unban self, +i: use /cs invite and getkey, +o: /cs op, +t: /cs topic, +v: /cs voice, +f: assign the previous flags to others
[2016/01/09 09:51:48] <mt> Tobbi: 4     Tobbi                  +Ofo [modified 2w 5d 23h ago]
[2016/01/09 09:51:52] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/01/09 09:52:05] <Tobbi> So, I do have founder status, don't I?
[2016/01/09 09:52:12] <mt> no
[2016/01/09 09:52:16] <Tobbi> Ah, right
[2016/01/09 09:52:19] <Karkus> mt: How do you check?
[2016/01/09 09:52:20] <mt> +f is *not* founder
[2016/01/09 09:52:28] <mt> Karkus: /cs access list #supertux
[2016/01/09 09:52:32] <Tobbi> I am not versed when it comes to IRC access rights.
[2016/01/09 09:54:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: At least, on linux mint I can only get 0.3.5
[2016/01/09 09:54:17] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2016/01/09 09:54:22] <Tobbi> We need to notify them.
[2016/01/09 09:54:31] <mt> Tobbi: Linux Mint won't update them
[2016/01/09 09:54:38] <Tobbi> mt: Why not?
[2016/01/09 09:54:52] <grumbel> Mint feeds from Ubuntu
[2016/01/09 09:55:09] <mt> they never update software to new versions, just security fixes
[2016/01/09 09:55:14] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/01/09 09:55:17] <Tobbi> So, well...
[2016/01/09 09:55:21] <Karkus> mt: Why not?
[2016/01/09 09:55:22] <mt> except for Firefox, Thunderbird and LibreOffice or so
[2016/01/09 09:55:29] <mt> Karkus: because stability
[2016/01/09 09:55:36] <Tobbi> We need to convince them that SuperTux 0.4.0 is a big security fix.
[2016/01/09 09:55:46] <Tobbi> So big that it needs a new version number.
[2016/01/09 09:55:48] <mt> that's what all debian/ubuntu based distros do
[2016/01/09 09:55:49] <grumbel> Karkus: standard practice in all 'stable' distributions ('stable' meaning 'doesn't change' not 'doesn't crash')
[2016/01/09 09:56:00] <Tobbi> ah!
[2016/01/09 09:56:23] <mt> Tobbi: they'll just backport everything security related to 0.3.5(a) :D
[2016/01/09 09:56:49] <Tobbi> damn
[2016/01/09 09:56:49] <Karkus> I need to change to arch...
[2016/01/09 09:57:05] <mt> Karkus: or debian sid/unstable if you prefer that
[2016/01/09 09:57:17] <mt> there again, unstable as in 'does change often'
[2016/01/09 09:57:25] <mt> or fedora rawhide
[2016/01/09 09:58:41] <Karkus> mt: Maybe sometime soon. Not now, I would probably just mess it up and delete my computer from existence
[2016/01/09 09:58:53] <Tobbi> Black hole?
[2016/01/09 09:58:56] <mt> also https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Amaths22%3ASuperTux&package=supertux2
[2016/01/09 09:58:57] <Tobbi> Anyway, meeting starts in 2 minutes.
[2016/01/09 09:59:15] <giby> Meeting in 1 minute
[2016/01/09 09:59:18] <mt> Karkus: try the ubuntu 14.04 package for Linux Mint 17.3
[2016/01/09 09:59:31] <mt> 30s
[2016/01/09 09:59:44] <mt> doesn't look like Hume2 will show up :/
[2016/01/09 09:59:45] <maths22> Good morning! (or afternoon or whatever depending on where you are)
[2016/01/09 09:59:50] <Tobbi> Hello maths22.
[2016/01/09 09:59:54] <Tobbi> I am impressed.
[2016/01/09 09:59:56] <Tobbi> Right on time!
[2016/01/09 10:00:03] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/01/09 10:00:08] <Tobbi> Hello everyone.
[2016/01/09 10:00:12] <mt> Let's start!
[2016/01/09 10:00:13] <Tobbi> To this our first meeting.
[2016/01/09 10:00:18] <Tobbi> I'll let mt lead it.
[2016/01/09 10:00:19] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/01/09 10:00:21] <Karkus> From here on, nothing off topic!
[2016/01/09 10:00:35] <mt> OK then
[2016/01/09 10:00:39] <giby> Tobbi, first meeting after M2 :p
[2016/01/09 10:00:40] <mt> Karkus: good point
[2016/01/09 10:00:43] <Tobbi> giby: Yes.
[2016/01/09 10:00:57] <mt> So we have https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/292 as our meeting agenda
[2016/01/09 10:01:01] @ Hume2 joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/09 10:01:01] @ Mode +v Hume2 by ChanServ
[2016/01/09 10:01:02] <giby> So lets discuss, Markus had a list
[2016/01/09 10:01:03] <maths22> We have working logging, right?
[2016/01/09 10:01:08] <Karkus> Hume2: Hello!
[2016/01/09 10:01:08] <Tobbi> Hello Hume2. Right on time.
[2016/01/09 10:01:10] <mt> Oh Hume2, welcome,
[2016/01/09 10:01:14] <Hume2> Hello
[2016/01/09 10:01:18] <Tobbi> giby: Markus = me?
[2016/01/09 10:01:24] <Tobbi> Or did you mean Karkus_
[2016/01/09 10:01:24] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/01/09 10:01:55] <mt> Karkus: since you have some points on #292: want to start with that?
[2016/01/09 10:01:56] <giby> ... damn autocorect
[2016/01/09 10:01:59] <Tobbi> Roadmap: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/292
[2016/01/09 10:02:07] <Tobbi> or rather meeting logs.
[2016/01/09 10:02:23] <giby> lets talk about forest...
[2016/01/09 10:02:29] <Karkus> Okay, everyone: Future of the forest world.
[2016/01/09 10:02:35] <giby> Hi Hume2
[2016/01/09 10:02:49] <Tobbi> In my opinion, forest world is great. It's too well known and used across addon levels.
[2016/01/09 10:02:51] <giby> Forest needs a boss...
[2016/01/09 10:02:54] <Tobbi> So we can't remove it.
[2016/01/09 10:02:58] <mt> http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=6697
[2016/01/09 10:03:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't think we should remove it either
[2016/01/09 10:03:13] <maths22> Why might we even possibly want to remove it?
[2016/01/09 10:03:21] <mt> yeah, we should actually fix it
[2016/01/09 10:03:22] <Karkus> I think we need a plan on how to update it.
[2016/01/09 10:03:29] <Tobbi> maths22: The old README stated that it might get removed.
[2016/01/09 10:03:44] <mt> Could we, like, make a branch `forest-world-redesign`
[2016/01/09 10:03:48] <Tobbi> What I would suggest is for the graphics to be improved...
[2016/01/09 10:03:50] <mt> and work on the worldmap in there
[2016/01/09 10:03:56] <Tobbi> mt: Good idea.
[2016/01/09 10:03:56] <mt> and all other stuff?
[2016/01/09 10:04:08] <Hume2> We need to improve the ghosttree.
[2016/01/09 10:04:09] <mt> other stuff = other forest-related stuff
[2016/01/09 10:04:17] <maths22> Keeping that separate would make sense
[2016/01/09 10:04:22] <mt> do we agree on keeping ghosttree?
[2016/01/09 10:04:31] <maths22> Hume2: I've actually never figured out how one is supposed to beat ghosttree
[2016/01/09 10:04:38] <mt> or should we trash it for something other
[2016/01/09 10:04:42] <mt> maths22: same
[2016/01/09 10:04:43] <maths22> Can someone explain the idea of ghosttree?
[2016/01/09 10:04:48] @ irungentoo joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/09 10:04:51] <Tobbi> Might only be my opinion but I still prefer the icy graphics more than the forest graphics. If that can be changed, that would be great.
[2016/01/09 10:04:57] <Hume2> maths22: PM
[2016/01/09 10:05:13] <giby> Hume2, gist-tree is the proposed boss? The ugly stuff we cannot kill?
[2016/01/09 10:05:20] <mt> Hume2: can you PM me as well about that?
[2016/01/09 10:05:26] <Tobbi> I mean: if the forest graphics could be improved and good quality graphics can be added, that would be great.
[2016/01/09 10:05:31] <Karkus> mt: Trash
[2016/01/09 10:05:35] <Hume2> mt: OK, PM
[2016/01/09 10:05:46] <mt> Tobbi: some of the forest graphics are well designed some levels look ugly tho
[2016/01/09 10:05:47] <maths22> Tobbi: I think the Icy graphics are more polished, and therefore look better
[2016/01/09 10:05:55] <mt> because the tiles aren't used in a proper place
[2016/01/09 10:06:05] <Tobbi> maths22, mt: We desperately need a graphics designer.
[2016/01/09 10:06:11] <giby> Ghost tree is a bad boss... something else had been proposed
[2016/01/09 10:06:17] <Tobbi> No one of us is any good when it comes to GIMP / photoshop.
[2016/01/09 10:06:22] <maths22> Do we have the sources for most of the graphics (i.e. the XCF files or whatever)
[2016/01/09 10:06:31] <Tobbi> maths22: I believe most of those are in the media repo
[2016/01/09 10:07:03] <mt> there's also http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/gimp/drawing/
[2016/01/09 10:07:06] <Hume2> Each boss should have two attacks.
[2016/01/09 10:07:24] <Hume2> So add one attack to ghosttree or make a new one.
[2016/01/09 10:07:33] <maths22> I was thinking about this earlier-I wounder if the data dir should really be its own branch in a submodule
[2016/01/09 10:07:35] <Karkus> The forest boss should be harder, and more interesting
[2016/01/09 10:07:40] <Hume2> Actuallly...
[2016/01/09 10:07:48] <Hume2> Ghosttree has two attacks.
[2016/01/09 10:07:56] <Tobbi> maths22: Data dir in a submodule could be interesting.
[2016/01/09 10:08:13] <Karkus> Hume2: But, it's not clear what you have to do, and it's not a very interesting fight.
[2016/01/09 10:08:29] <Karkus> maths22: That's an interesting idea
[2016/01/09 10:08:30] <maths22> Tobbi: Ideally that would have already happened, because my main reason for suggesting it it to shrink the main repository
[2016/01/09 10:08:42] <maths22> Checking it out takes way longer than necessary
[2016/01/09 10:08:50] <Tobbi> For the graphics designer to know what to do, we actually need some actual items for them to do.
[2016/01/09 10:08:50] <Hume2> Karkus: Give it more lives?
[2016/01/09 10:09:02] <mt> well we still shouldn't put the graphics sources into the data repo
[2016/01/09 10:09:04] <Karkus> Hume2: That makes it longer, not more interesting
[2016/01/09 10:09:07] <maths22> For most code-related purposes, the history of the data dir is irrelevent
[2016/01/09 10:09:10] <maths22> mt: I agree
[2016/01/09 10:09:25] <maths22> That should be its own thing
[2016/01/09 10:09:28] <Tobbi> So, let's have a supertux data submodule, I am all for that.
[2016/01/09 10:09:32] <Karkus> Would that mean ci-skip wouldn't be needed?
[2016/01/09 10:09:40] <Tobbi> We can then also easily separate media related issues / bugs from code.
[2016/01/09 10:09:52] <Tobbi> Yes, I believe so.
[2016/01/09 10:09:53] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/09 10:09:54] <Hume2> Ok, but it's off-topic now.
[2016/01/09 10:09:57] <mt> speaking of sources, we should import https://discarded-ideas.org/music to some media repo
[2016/01/09 10:10:01] <giby> Else for Boss in forest there was another proposal http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Bosses
[2016/01/09 10:10:14] <mt> Karkus: no, because some changes still don't affect the build
[2016/01/09 10:10:35] <Karkus> mt: But, for commits to the data repo
[2016/01/09 10:11:09] <Karkus> I think we should definitely remake the worldmap for the forest
[2016/01/09 10:11:21] <Tobbi> The actual layout or also the design?
[2016/01/09 10:11:27] <Tobbi> Aka, get new redesigned tiles?
[2016/01/09 10:11:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: layout
[2016/01/09 10:11:31] <Tobbi> okay.
[2016/01/09 10:11:46] <grumbel> As for bosses, I would mostly just forget about them. They have a terrible work-to-playtime ratio and aren't really worth the effort
[2016/01/09 10:11:55] <giby> the style of Iceland having changed, forest should be corrected accordingly
[2016/01/09 10:12:16] <Karkus> And I think the level "A Mouldy Grotto" could be underground and be dark with the earth powerup
[2016/01/09 10:12:19] <grumbel> If somebody wants to code a boss and make it fun, that's fine, but design-by-committee is just a waste of effort
[2016/01/09 10:12:21] <maths22> Karkus: I agree on the layout.  I personally would kind of like the layout style of Hume's Rainbow Caves (with branches with keys at the end)
[2016/01/09 10:12:34] <maths22> I don't know what other people would like concerning layout
[2016/01/09 10:12:51] <mt> Possibly bosses could be replaced with some harder levels
[2016/01/09 10:13:03] <mt> where scripting is used to unlock the castle
[2016/01/09 10:13:29] <maths22> mt: I'm not sure what I follow with that last point
[2016/01/09 10:13:29] <Karkus> mt: No, we can create a boss, but not really consider it a necessity or priority.
[2016/01/09 10:13:42] <Tobbi> I will add some last minute additions to the meeting notes...
[2016/01/09 10:13:53] <mt> Karkus: sounds ok
[2016/01/09 10:13:53] <Karkus> mt: As in, don't cry if it's not included in M3
[2016/01/09 10:14:01] <Karkus> mt: We don't cry
[2016/01/09 10:14:34] <mt> maths22: what's the style of Hume'2 Rainbow Caves? don't remember that anymore
[2016/01/09 10:14:34] <Karkus> So, in conclusion, we will remake the worldmap.
[2016/01/09 10:14:47] <mt> yes
[2016/01/09 10:14:50] <Karkus> But I also think we should get rid of tonnes of levels
[2016/01/09 10:14:51] <mt> and some levels, I guess
[2016/01/09 10:15:14] <Karkus> Most of them are repetitive, and the good ones are creative but messy
[2016/01/09 10:15:25] <Tobbi> Are we talking about getting rid of ones in Hume's rainbow cave or overall?
[2016/01/09 10:15:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: We are talking about the forest world.
[2016/01/09 10:15:43] <mt> Tobbi: no, maths22 mentioned that
[2016/01/09 10:15:47] <maths22> mt: More or less hub and spoke
[2016/01/09 10:15:56] <Tobbi> Hmm, okay...
[2016/01/09 10:15:59] <mt> can you screenshot?
[2016/01/09 10:16:11] <giby> Well, we should discuss about game progression
[2016/01/09 10:16:11] <maths22> mt: sure
[2016/01/09 10:16:23] <Tobbi> btw: I added these three points to the meeting notes:
[2016/01/09 10:16:23] <Karkus> giby: Too broad a subject.
[2016/01/09 10:16:33] <Tobbi> Release process was rather bumpy IMO, how do we make this smoother?
[2016/01/09 10:16:33] <Tobbi> Scripting additions to make more interesting levels
[2016/01/09 10:16:33] <Tobbi> What do interesting levels actually comprise?
[2016/01/09 10:16:45] <Tobbi> So, maybe if we could discuss them at the end...
[2016/01/09 10:16:58] <giby> some elements should appear only from world 2 or world 3
[2016/01/09 10:17:05] <Karkus> giby: Yes.
[2016/01/09 10:17:14] <Hume2> Doors?
[2016/01/09 10:17:19] <Karkus> giby: Maybe earth powerup
[2016/01/09 10:17:50] <datahead7777> You could look at having the game connect to a server application for levels.  Then you won't have to get rid of any levels but will not have to package a lot of user contributed levels with the game.
[2016/01/09 10:18:07] <datahead7777> People could then post their levels to the server and share them with the community
[2016/01/09 10:18:08] <maths22> Tobbi: What do you mean?
[2016/01/09 10:18:11] <datahead7777> They could also be viewed by the website
[2016/01/09 10:18:14] <Tobbi> maths22: Mean by what?
[2016/01/09 10:18:17] <maths22> datahead7777: that is the future plan to replace the addon system
[2016/01/09 10:18:18] <Karkus> datahead7777: Hmmm
[2016/01/09 10:18:19] <giby> for exemple, trampoline should appear in forest and not In Iceland, doors too... We can decide moving coins should appear in world 3 etc
[2016/01/09 10:18:20] <mt> datahead7777: well, the main levels are included in the game, addons are hosted on github dynamically
[2016/01/09 10:18:30] <maths22> Tobbi: Sorry-about the release process needing to be smoother
[2016/01/09 10:18:36] <maths22> mt:  http://snag.gy/m8iJH.jpg
[2016/01/09 10:18:59] <Tobbi> maths22: Hmm. Maybe I am mistaken...? Maybe it was just me... But a lot of last minute fixes went in.
[2016/01/09 10:19:11] <Tobbi> Actually, it could've only been me and my last minute changes :D
[2016/01/09 10:19:14] <Tobbi> I will remove that point.
[2016/01/09 10:19:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: Last minute fixes are what a release is :P
[2016/01/09 10:19:25] <mt> well, the homebrew packaging also needed a fix
[2016/01/09 10:19:39] <mt> but that'd have worked fine as a patch in homebrew
[2016/01/09 10:19:45] <Karkus> datahead7777: I love the idea, but hosting is a problem.
[2016/01/09 10:19:50] <Tobbi> Okay, let's carry on...
[2016/01/09 10:20:02] <Karkus> So, we need to implement the "Ghost forest" concetp
[2016/01/09 10:20:10] <Karkus> s/concetp/concept/
[2016/01/09 10:20:10] <red_bot> Karkus meant: "So, we need to implement the "Ghost forest" concept"
[2016/01/09 10:20:11] <maths22> mt: That is true, but mostly because homebrew isn't quite building like normal OS X, nor do we want it to behave like a normal UNIXy system
[2016/01/09 10:20:22] <Hume2> *sigh*
[2016/01/09 10:20:27] <maths22> Karkus: What do you mean by the "ghost forest" concept?
[2016/01/09 10:20:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: We have been thinking about adding that website where people can contribute their levels... and linking it to the editor.
[2016/01/09 10:20:37] <Tobbi> I will add that as a point to the roadmap
[2016/01/09 10:20:51] <Hume2> OK, Ghost forest.
[2016/01/09 10:21:05] <Karkus> maths22: As in, only 2 levels are actually "Ghost forest"
[2016/01/09 10:21:13] <giby> Tobbi, Karkus I think we decided it should be submitted on the forum
[2016/01/09 10:21:20] <mt> that's not even real ghost forest
[2016/01/09 10:21:28] <mt> the tileset for that is ugly
[2016/01/09 10:21:32] <Hume2> So more ghost forest levels.
[2016/01/09 10:21:55] <Karkus> giby: But, in honesty, only about 5 people know anything about level editing
[2016/01/09 10:22:03] <maths22> giby: We were considering eventually replacing with a system which combines the addon manager repo, the old community submission website, and integrates the level editor
[2016/01/09 10:22:11] <maths22> Of coruse, this is a long-term goal
[2016/01/09 10:22:11] <datahead7777> I'd be curious to learn more about the add on system / your plan for levels on a server, but I don't want to interrupt your discussion
[2016/01/09 10:22:24] <grumbel> The idea behind the original ghost forest was that it would be some kind of MarioBros2'ish shadow world that you can travel to from the regular world
[2016/01/09 10:22:27] <mt> maths22: and we'd need a better server, one we can rely on
[2016/01/09 10:22:28] <Tobbi> datahead7777: I have added a point behind "level editor".
[2016/01/09 10:22:34] <Tobbi> eeh subordinate to level editor.
[2016/01/09 10:22:35] <maths22> mt: Than what server?
[2016/01/09 10:22:41] <Tobbi> So, we can discuss it when necessary.
[2016/01/09 10:22:52] <mt> than brlcad.org and mine, I guess
[2016/01/09 10:22:57] <maths22> mt: OK
[2016/01/09 10:23:02] <Hume2> Please on topic.
[2016/01/09 10:23:14] <Hume2> We now dicuss Ghost forest, don't we?
[2016/01/09 10:23:29] <mt> Hume2: well, discussing things that come up can be on topic
[2016/01/09 10:23:31] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2016/01/09 10:23:34] <mt> but, ok, ghost forest
[2016/01/09 10:24:07] <Karkus> Ghost forest. We need a good transition
[2016/01/09 10:24:12] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2016/01/09 10:24:17] <mt> yeah
[2016/01/09 10:24:27] <mt> there should be some cutscene
[2016/01/09 10:24:40] <Karkus> So, should it be in the worldmap or in the levels?
[2016/01/09 10:24:47] <Hume2> Or you can enter a tree and then leave in the ghost forest.
[2016/01/09 10:24:58] <Tobbi> Is anyone taking notes, by the way?
[2016/01/09 10:25:04] <maths22> Also, the implementation of ghost forest in those levels feels really hacky-it requires two copies of the level map
[2016/01/09 10:25:05] <Tobbi> Sorry, I should've asked that before.
[2016/01/09 10:25:14] <mt> Tobbi: I'm logging this, head8debian is as well
[2016/01/09 10:25:18] <maths22> Tobbi: I kind of figure we can review the logs after to compile something good
[2016/01/09 10:25:19] <Hume2> I think, there should be one transit level.
[2016/01/09 10:25:28] <maths22> I'm always logging :) (IRSSI setting)
[2016/01/09 10:25:29] <Karkus> mt: No one wants to search through the logs
[2016/01/09 10:25:30] <Tobbi> mt: Good, action items can be devised after the logs have been reviewd.
[2016/01/09 10:25:42] <Hume2> I'll note something too.
[2016/01/09 10:25:52] <Karkus> Once we're done, someone post the log on the wiki.
[2016/01/09 10:25:56] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2016/01/09 10:25:58] <Tobbi> And to the forums.
[2016/01/09 10:26:03] <Tobbi> And the usual communication channels.
[2016/01/09 10:26:08] <Tobbi> Okay, let's carry on.
[2016/01/09 10:26:20] <Hume2> OK, the ghost forest transition.
[2016/01/09 10:26:38] <Karkus> So, what causes the transition?
[2016/01/09 10:26:45] <Hume2> Well...
[2016/01/09 10:26:49] <Tobbi> I'm sorry, but what transition are we talking about?
[2016/01/09 10:26:57] <Hume2> wibbly wobbly timey wimey...
[2016/01/09 10:27:03] <Tobbi> What?
[2016/01/09 10:27:19] <grumbel> Tobbi: http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/File:Ghost-portal.jpg
[2016/01/09 10:28:07] <maths22> I personally think the ghost forest should be a section of the worldmap
[2016/01/09 10:28:19] <giby> Karkus, I can edit levels.... If there were a fucking level editor!!!
[2016/01/09 10:28:23] <maths22> I.E. there should be a ghost-forest section, where all the levels are ghost-forest
[2016/01/09 10:28:30] <mt> giby: tried flexlay
[2016/01/09 10:28:39] <mt> https://twitter.com/supertux_team/status/685845456346296320
[2016/01/09 10:28:41] <giby> IT DOES NOT WORK!!!
[2016/01/09 10:28:52] <mt> giby: what does not work?
[2016/01/09 10:28:59] <Karkus> giby: Nothing works!
[2016/01/09 10:29:17] <grumbel> giby: fill bug reports
[2016/01/09 10:29:19] <maths22> Please discuss this later
[2016/01/09 10:29:22] <mt> anyway, level editor, off topic
[2016/01/09 10:29:34] <mt> move on to the ghost forest transition
[2016/01/09 10:29:35] <Karkus> mt: Not technically, it's on the list
[2016/01/09 10:29:38] <Karkus> mt: Okay
[2016/01/09 10:29:41] <mt> but not now
[2016/01/09 10:29:43] <grumbel> Anyway, I agree with giby, I think discussing extra content is a bit premature
[2016/01/09 10:29:58] <grumbel> I'd prefer smoothing the stuff out that already exists
[2016/01/09 10:30:16] <Karkus> grumbel: What would you like us to smooth?
[2016/01/09 10:30:32] <grumbel> like having an editor that actually works across all OSs
[2016/01/09 10:30:44] <grumbel> maybe some thumbnails in the addon menu
[2016/01/09 10:30:49] <Karkus> grumbel: That is being worked on.
[2016/01/09 10:30:50] <giby> Well, To "Decide" about next worlds, we need graph designers, we don't...
[2016/01/09 10:30:56] <Karkus> grumbel: Good idea
[2016/01/09 10:31:00] <grumbel> And for something big: multiplayer
[2016/01/09 10:31:14] <grumbel> (which goes beyond 'smoothing out', but it's mostly code, not content)
[2016/01/09 10:31:28] <mt> ghost forest is something less big and more smoothing out than multiplayer
[2016/01/09 10:32:05] <Karkus> mt: But is limited by the editors.
[2016/01/09 10:32:13] <mt> grumbel: when we're done with 'smoothing out', would you be able to draw some graphics for other worlds?
[2016/01/09 10:32:15] <mt> Karkus: sure
[2016/01/09 10:32:26] <Karkus> By the way, Flexlay won the poll.
[2016/01/09 10:32:30] <Karkus> I think...
[2016/01/09 10:32:31] <giby> So, Just an idea for multi player: Do we adapt a gameplay like Super Mario 2 US ?
[2016/01/09 10:32:36] <grumbel> mt: yes, making graphics is not really a problem
[2016/01/09 10:32:47] <mt> fine
[2016/01/09 10:32:59] <mt> then we need to figure out what's missing from 'smoothing out'
[2016/01/09 10:33:01] <Hume2> The stack of discuss themes is getting insane...
[2016/01/09 10:33:26] <mt> Karkus seems to be working on making flexlay platform compatible, what's missing is bug reports
[2016/01/09 10:33:44] <Tobbi> I am also contributing something to flexlay...
[2016/01/09 10:33:54] <mt> let me just test flexlay on OS X
[2016/01/09 10:34:09] <Karkus> polyphagia: If you could help with Flexlay, then that would be great
[2016/01/09 10:34:20] <Hume2> How we got from Ghost forest to Editor by the way?
[2016/01/09 10:34:27] <giby> grumbel, Can we ask you to smooth the tiles of ghost forest for a ghosty world? They didn't tile well
[2016/01/09 10:34:33] <Tobbi> Right, sorry, let's stay on topic.
[2016/01/09 10:34:52] <maths22> Hume2: Because we were discussing making levels for the forest - not that that is a good excuse
[2016/01/09 10:35:02] <mt> Karkus: can you give me some easy tasks for flexlay? I'll also be able to work on it the future
[2016/01/09 10:35:25] <Hume2> OK, I think, there doesn't have to be a portal, like portal.
[2016/01/09 10:35:31] @ Quintus_q joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/09 10:35:42] <Hume2> There could be a tree with a door.
[2016/01/09 10:35:47] <maths22> I think a level that transitions in the middle (like the current one does) would work as ell)
[2016/01/09 10:35:52] <maths22> s/ell/well/
[2016/01/09 10:35:52] <red_bot> maths22 meant: "I think a level that transitions in the middle (like the current one does) would work as well)"
[2016/01/09 10:36:02] <Hume2> You enter it, then enter the same door...
[2016/01/09 10:36:02] <Karkus> Or maybe, you go underground and emerge in a different sector?
[2016/01/09 10:36:14] <Hume2> Another possibility.
[2016/01/09 10:36:24] <Tobbi> That is even possible, currently, I think (?)
[2016/01/09 10:36:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: I think so.
[2016/01/09 10:36:41] <Hume2> So this or something else?
[2016/01/09 10:38:21] <Karkus> Okay, let's end it there. When we have an editor, we can create an underground area, and then a ghost forest sector, and add levels after
[2016/01/09 10:38:33] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/01/09 10:38:34] <Hume2> OK.
[2016/01/09 10:38:38] <Tobbi> So, next topic?
[2016/01/09 10:38:46] <Karkus> Yep
[2016/01/09 10:38:49] <Karkus> The editor
[2016/01/09 10:38:58] <Karkus> Flexlay won the poll.
[2016/01/09 10:39:03] <Hume2> wit...
[2016/01/09 10:39:08] <Hume2> *wait
[2016/01/09 10:39:08] <mt> re editor cross-platform: homebrew's pyqt4 for python3 seems to be broken right now
[2016/01/09 10:39:25] <Hume2> Forest world is still in the stack.)
[2016/01/09 10:39:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: ^ Did't it work for you?
[2016/01/09 10:39:44] <Karkus> Hume2: Maybe post-meeting
[2016/01/09 10:39:52] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, it did. but I think I have pyqt4 installed using macports...
[2016/01/09 10:40:04] <Hume2> OK, clearing stack, theme: Editor::Flexlay
[2016/01/09 10:40:50] <Karkus> mt: Why is homebrew needed?
[2016/01/09 10:41:09] <mt> Karkus: most people use it for pyqt
[2016/01/09 10:41:12] <mt> I guess
[2016/01/09 10:41:12] <maths22> I have to go now, but I should be back on soon
[2016/01/09 10:41:25] <datahead7777> Will you still have an in game editor or only the external Python editor?
[2016/01/09 10:41:27] <mt> as in, for installing pyqt
[2016/01/09 10:41:38] <Tobbi> datahead7777: Yes, ingame editor is Hume2's project.
[2016/01/09 10:41:45] <datahead7777> Ok
[2016/01/09 10:41:47] <Tobbi> And it's scheduled for the next major release.
[2016/01/09 10:42:25] <Karkus> Ugh, Mac OSX is so confusing...
[2016/01/09 10:42:36] <giby> I'm in favor of in game editor...
[2016/01/09 10:42:45] <Karkus> giby: It's going to be included.
[2016/01/09 10:42:49] <Karkus> mt: http://www.pyinstaller.org/
[2016/01/09 10:42:57] <Tobbi> We will have both, one for simple editing, the other for complicated editing.
[2016/01/09 10:43:17] <Tobbi> Or should I say "advanced editing".
[2016/01/09 10:43:28] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/01/09 10:43:33] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2016/01/09 10:44:32] <Tobbi> Okay, so what's left for the editor?
[2016/01/09 10:44:33] <Hume2> So what do we need to decide on it next?
[2016/01/09 10:44:39] <Tobbi> I mean: Okay, we have a buglist...
[2016/01/09 10:44:45] <Tobbi> Is there anything else people want to have?
[2016/01/09 10:44:50] <giby> Karkus, OS X just need a support for Quartz

[2016/01/09 10:46:35] <Tobbi> We have improved it quite substantially...
[2016/01/09 10:46:47] <giby> I should try again
[2016/01/09 10:47:02] @ jesusalva_bot is now known as jesusalva
[2016/01/09 10:47:17] <mt> so what's on topic now?
[2016/01/09 10:47:28] <Hume2> Before we change the topic...
[2016/01/09 10:47:30] <Tobbi> mt: Flexlay, the editor...
[2016/01/09 10:47:32] <Tobbi> I think.
[2016/01/09 10:47:46] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/01/09 10:47:49] <mt> what's still there to discuss
[2016/01/09 10:47:51] * jesusalva just arr
[2016/01/09 10:48:01] <mt> all the issues and features are in the bug tracker
[2016/01/09 10:48:05] <Tobbi> Possibly...
[2016/01/09 10:48:06] <mt> it just needs fixing
[2016/01/09 10:48:12] <Karkus> mt: There's more to be added
[2016/01/09 10:48:16] <Tobbi> We should get more people to code on the editor...
[2016/01/09 10:48:20] <Karkus> When should we aim for a release?
[2016/01/09 10:48:27] <Karkus> of Flexlay?
[2016/01/09 10:48:37] <mt> Karkus: I guess flexlay 1 should be released with supertux 0.5.0
[2016/01/09 10:48:41] <mt> at the same point
[2016/01/09 10:48:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: I'd say we take our time with both.
[2016/01/09 10:48:56] <Tobbi> So, let's push SuperTux 0.5.0 way back.
[2016/01/09 10:49:06] <Tobbi> Flexlay isn't nearly polished.
[2016/01/09 10:49:14] <Karkus> mt: I actually disagree. We should make Flexlay released before, so we can make levels for 0.5.0
[2016/01/09 10:49:20] <Karkus> s/we/people/
[2016/01/09 10:49:20] <red_bot> Karkus meant: "mt: I actually disagree. We should make Flexlay released before, so people can make levels for 0.5.0"
[2016/01/09 10:49:24] <mt> Karkus: hm
[2016/01/09 10:49:27] <mt> sounds ok
[2016/01/09 10:49:30] <Hume2> OK
[2016/01/09 10:49:40] <mt> next topic?
[2016/01/09 10:49:44] <Tobbi> Unless we want people to test their levels with up-to-date features...
[2016/01/09 10:49:49] <Hume2> Before we change the topic...
[2016/01/09 10:50:06] <Hume2> I just want to say that we should also dicuss this https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/labels/status%3Aneeds-discussion
[2016/01/09 10:50:07] <Tobbi> If we have the website in place, we could let people upload their creations...
[2016/01/09 10:50:16] <Tobbi> oh god.
[2016/01/09 10:50:34] <Hume2> I mean after the main topics.
[2016/01/09 10:50:35] <Karkus> Can't we just get onto the next topic now?
[2016/01/09 10:50:38] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2016/01/09 10:50:40] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/01/09 10:50:57] <Hume2> Multiplayer.
[2016/01/09 10:51:08] <Tobbi> Sounds fun. And definitely a requirement for 0.5.0.
[2016/01/09 10:51:18] <mt> multiplayer is a big feature, I'd suggest it for 0.6.0
[2016/01/09 10:51:26] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2016/01/09 10:51:35] <mt> Tobbi: we wanted to fix forest world and story for 0.5.0
[2016/01/09 10:51:38] <Tobbi> mt: When do we intend to release 0.5.0?
[2016/01/09 10:51:40] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2016/01/09 10:51:53] @ gryffyn joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/09 10:51:55] <grumbel> It's not really that big, there was a patch for it floating around a long time ago
[2016/01/09 10:51:55] <datahead7777> Is it multiplayer on the same computer?
[2016/01/09 10:52:00] <pentagon> [10flexlay] 07Karkus476 opened issue 09#72: Allow change in version of executable 13http://git.io/vu58J
[2016/01/09 10:52:04] <Hume2> If we want to postpone it, shall we also postpone this discussion?
[2016/01/09 10:52:15] <Karkus> datahead7777: Yes
[2016/01/09 10:52:17] <grumbel> datahead7777: yes, that would be the easiest way to do it
[2016/01/09 10:52:24] <mt> I guess if we make progress with flexlay and the redesign of forest, 0.5.0 can be released somewhen in Mai/June/July?
[2016/01/09 10:52:32] <datahead7777> Yes, a networked version would not at all be trivial
[2016/01/09 10:52:32] <Tobbi> Okay, sounds good...
[2016/01/09 10:52:34] <mt> Hume2: yes,
[2016/01/09 10:52:35] <grumbel> network would be a whole new can of worms and require some larger rewrites
[2016/01/09 10:52:57] <Hume2> So postponing theme?
[2016/01/09 10:53:09] <Karkus> grumbel: I don't think so, we can just create a new controller. But it's bound to introduce millions of bugs
[2016/01/09 10:53:11] <Tobbi> I guess that would be best at least for the networking things.
[2016/01/09 10:53:23] <Tobbi> Let's not stress ourselves out on this.
[2016/01/09 10:53:26] <mt> yes networking problems because networking sucks in C(++) :/
[2016/01/09 10:53:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah.
[2016/01/09 10:53:33] <Tobbi> People expect this project to be dead :P
[2016/01/09 10:53:43] <Tobbi> So, we can chill...
[2016/01/09 10:54:06] <Karkus> Tobbi: Or we can try to increase the interest.
[2016/01/09 10:54:14] <Tobbi> Karkus: That would work, too...
[2016/01/09 10:54:26] <Karkus> Okay. Multiplayer postponed.
[2016/01/09 10:54:27] <mt> ------ so: next topic ------
[2016/01/09 10:54:32] <mt> Hume2
[2016/01/09 10:54:38] <Hume2> More moves.
[2016/01/09 10:54:48] <Hume2> Just I want to say this:
[2016/01/09 10:55:09] <Hume2> When I write # before a question, then answer yes or no.
[2016/01/09 10:55:12] @ jesusalva left channel #supertux ("God")
[2016/01/09 10:55:15] <Hume2> OK?
[2016/01/09 10:55:19] <Hume2> # OK?
[2016/01/09 10:55:21] <mt> yes
[2016/01/09 10:55:47] <Hume2> So theme: More moves :: swimming
[2016/01/09 10:56:17] <Karkus> I've added multiplayer to post 0.5.0
[2016/01/09 10:56:19] <Hume2> I think that swimming should be the only possible action in water.
[2016/01/09 10:56:25] <Tobbi> I think this should be fairly trivial... But swimming would probably require rethinking levels.
[2016/01/09 10:56:30] <Tobbi> Do we really want that?
[2016/01/09 10:56:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes.
[2016/01/09 10:56:41] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/01/09 10:56:43] <mt> yes
[2016/01/09 10:56:50] <Tobbi> Okay, fine.
[2016/01/09 10:56:51] <Hume2> Tobbi, you are allowed to write # as well.
[2016/01/09 10:56:54] <grumbel> not in 0.5.0
[2016/01/09 10:56:55] <Tobbi> Oh, sorry.
[2016/01/09 10:57:08] <Hume2> # Should it be in 0.5.0?
[2016/01/09 10:57:17] <Hume2> I think yes.
[2016/01/09 10:57:49] <Karkus> Yes.
[2016/01/09 10:57:50] <mt> yes
[2016/01/09 10:57:56] <grumbel> depends on the goal of 0.5.0, if you just want forest polished up then there is no need for swimming
[2016/01/09 10:58:04] <Tobbi> Considering the amount it needs to re-think the levels...Unless we just change tux's sprite, we should probably postpone that...
[2016/01/09 10:58:14] <Karkus> grumbel: Except, it is polishing the forest world.
[2016/01/09 10:58:14] <Tobbi> But that's only my opinion.
[2016/01/09 10:58:17] <mt> changing 'yes' to 'if it's possible to do in time, and useful'
[2016/01/09 10:58:17] <Hume2> Not many levels have water.
[2016/01/09 10:58:39] <Karkus> I think it should be like penguin mario in super mario bros Wii and Wii U
[2016/01/09 10:58:47] <Tobbi> Hume2: I can think of some contrib levels that do.
[2016/01/09 10:58:56] <Hume2> Hmmm...
[2016/01/09 10:59:00] <Karkus> When you swim in water, it's not like jumping repeatedly, it's like actual swimming
[2016/01/09 10:59:04] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/01/09 10:59:08] <mt> Tobbi: we don't support contrib levels
[2016/01/09 10:59:16] <Hume2> I think that swimming won't break them.
[2016/01/09 10:59:16] <mt> so
[2016/01/09 10:59:17] <Karkus> I think mario's swimming levels are bad.
[2016/01/09 10:59:20] <grumbel> the problem is that we have lots of (contrib) levels that use water as deadly barrier
[2016/01/09 10:59:37] <Karkus> grumbel: They were told not to...
[2016/01/09 10:59:40] @ Quit: lumidify: Ping timeout: 260 seconds
[2016/01/09 10:59:42] <datahead7777> I agree with Karkus - I think there are better ways to do swimming than Mario like mechanics
[2016/01/09 10:59:44] <Tobbi> Could we have a different type of water for swimming?
[2016/01/09 10:59:47] <mt> grumbel: as a solution, we could stop making these available for 0.5.0
[2016/01/09 10:59:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: No
[2016/01/09 10:59:50] <datahead7777> You probably don't want to be an overt Mario clone anyways
[2016/01/09 10:59:56] <Karkus> Confusion to the max.
[2016/01/09 10:59:58] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2016/01/09 11:00:00] <Tobbi> right
[2016/01/09 11:00:07] <giby> Well, if tux can swim... there is many thing to rethink
[2016/01/09 11:00:13] <Hume2> I thought a swimming mechanism, listen.
[2016/01/09 11:00:24] <Hume2> It will be like penguins swim.
[2016/01/09 11:00:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: There are actually two types of water, tile, and level
[2016/01/09 11:00:44] <Tobbi> hmmm...
[2016/01/09 11:00:51] <Hume2> Tux will only change the direction, but not the speed.
[2016/01/09 11:00:52] <Tobbi> Actually...
[2016/01/09 11:00:55] <maths22> When swimming, would you be able to go up and down?
[2016/01/09 11:01:04] <Hume2> Aim down.
[2016/01/09 11:01:10] <Hume2> And then you swim dows.
[2016/01/09 11:01:13] <Hume2> *down
[2016/01/09 11:01:22] <maths22> I think constant-speed motion would feel weird and forced in supertux
[2016/01/09 11:01:31] <Hume2> And you will accelerate when swimming.
[2016/01/09 11:01:52] <Hume2> You will start at zero and accelerate.
[2016/01/09 11:02:05] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/09 11:02:22] <Hume2> Tux would be able to bumb bonus blocks when having enough speed.
[2016/01/09 11:02:30] <Karkus> Constrast: https://youtu.be/8pdAYvnDbwE?t=38s and https://youtu.be/8pdAYvnDbwE?t=1m52s
[2016/01/09 11:02:43] <Karkus> This is my idea, the penguin one.
[2016/01/09 11:03:04] <Karkus> Press up, swim up
[2016/01/09 11:03:08] <Karkus> Press down, swim down
[2016/01/09 11:03:17] <Karkus> Press jump, get a little boost.
[2016/01/09 11:03:37] <Hume2> I don't like this.
[2016/01/09 11:03:39] <mt> Karkus: this shouldn't require any bonus, tho (does it in NSMB)?
[2016/01/09 11:03:47] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2016/01/09 11:03:48] <Karkus> mt: It won't.
[2016/01/09 11:03:52] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2016/01/09 11:03:54] <Karkus> mt: But in NSMB it does.
[2016/01/09 11:04:13] <Hume2> Penguins can survive in water for 9 mins.
[2016/01/09 11:04:18] <Karkus> So, in NSMB You need penguin mario, but Tux is a penguin already.
[2016/01/09 11:04:18] <Tobbi> But a bonus would be a great solution to the contrib level problems.
[2016/01/09 11:04:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: But penguins can swim.
[2016/01/09 11:04:32] <Tobbi> Hrm.
[2016/01/09 11:04:36] <Tobbi> Damn, yes, right
[2016/01/09 11:04:52] <Karkus> Hume2: What don't you like?
[2016/01/09 11:05:06] <Hume2> Penguins don't swim like that.
[2016/01/09 11:05:11] <mt> Tobbi: well, level designers were told not to use it
[2016/01/09 11:05:21] <Karkus> Hume2: How do penguins swim?
[2016/01/09 11:05:24] <maths22> mt: What were level designers told not to use?
[2016/01/09 11:05:32] <Karkus> maths22: Water.
[2016/01/09 11:05:32] <mt> maths22: water
[2016/01/09 11:05:34] <Tobbi> mt: But, I like the way "Yeti's revenge" uses water. I'd not like to break it.
[2016/01/09 11:05:35] <Hume2> Karkus: As I decribed.
[2016/01/09 11:05:45] <mt> Tobbi: hm
[2016/01/09 11:05:54] <Tobbi> Yeti's revenge is *the* best level set there is in SuperTux
[2016/01/09 11:06:01] <mt> we could make it require a bonus, as long as a specific variable isn't set
[2016/01/09 11:06:14] <Tobbi> That would be confusing...
[2016/01/09 11:06:15] <mt> and in our levels, on spawn, we call a script that sets that variable
[2016/01/09 11:06:19] <Karkus> mt: No, penguins are good swimmers.
[2016/01/09 11:06:26] <Tobbi> We need to think of a better way.
[2016/01/09 11:06:32] <Hume2> It would be invisible.
[2016/01/09 11:06:42] <Hume2> Maybe something like level rules.
[2016/01/09 11:06:46] <mt> Karkus: that would make it possible to still play the bonus levels without dropping support for it
[2016/01/09 11:06:56] <maths22> Conceptually, what would happen with swimming in "The Somewhat Smaller Bath"?
[2016/01/09 11:07:01] <mt> but from my side, we can drop the external levels
[2016/01/09 11:07:10] <Karkus> mt: we can remove the water from the levels
[2016/01/09 11:07:18] <Hume2> When is a level rule swimming #t, it would be possible to swim in that level.
[2016/01/09 11:07:24] <mt> maths22: I think it would work in "The Somewhat Smaller Bath"
[2016/01/09 11:07:27] <Karkus> Hume2: no, no, no, no, no.
[2016/01/09 11:07:34] <mt> possibly just as it was intended to do
[2016/01/09 11:07:37] <Hume2> Ok, just an idea.
[2016/01/09 11:07:41] <Karkus> That's just confusing.
[2016/01/09 11:08:03] <maths22> All levels need to treat water the same, however that is
[2016/01/09 11:08:10] <Karkus> maths22: Correct.
[2016/01/09 11:08:26] <mt> who wants change the water behavior for all levels? who wants to keep supporting old-style water?
[2016/01/09 11:08:38] <mt> # this is a question ^^
[2016/01/09 11:08:44] <maths22> Hear my idea (it may be stupid) - make walking slower in water, and press action to swim?
[2016/01/09 11:08:48] <Hume2> I'm for all levels.
[2016/01/09 11:08:50] <mt> I'm for dropping the old behavior
[2016/01/09 11:09:08] <Tobbi> I'm for using the old behaviour and solving the problem some other way.
[2016/01/09 11:09:22] <maths22> Tobbi: What problem is being solved
[2016/01/09 11:09:35] <Tobbi> maths22: Well, adding ability to swim...
[2016/01/09 11:09:40] <Tobbi> It's hard though...
[2016/01/09 11:09:42] <maths22> Tobbi: OK!
[2016/01/09 11:09:48] <maths22> What did you think of my suggestion?
[2016/01/09 11:09:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: The old behaviour is crap.
[2016/01/09 11:09:57] <Tobbi> maths22: Might work?
[2016/01/09 11:10:13] <mt> so, more people in support of dropping the old behavior, I guess?
[2016/01/09 11:10:21] <maths22> Karkus: Doesn't the old behavior just ignore the fact that it is water?
[2016/01/09 11:10:25] <Tobbi> Hrm...
[2016/01/09 11:10:28] <Karkus> maths22: Yeah.
[2016/01/09 11:10:47] <Hume2> maths22: What was it again? PM
[2016/01/09 11:10:52] <maths22> I personally think the old behavior should be replaced with something new that keeps existing water playable
[2016/01/09 11:11:03] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2016/01/09 11:11:04] <Tobbi> Actually... We need to revise the levels using water.
[2016/01/09 11:11:13] <Tobbi> And see if adding swimming would make those too easy.
[2016/01/09 11:11:26] <Karkus> maths22: Whoever added water to their level was wrong to do so.
[2016/01/09 11:11:31] <Tobbi> I'm merely thinking of the Yeti's Revenge ones as they use water.
[2016/01/09 11:11:43] <giby>  /msg ChanServ FLAGS #supertux
[2016/01/09 11:11:59] <Tobbi> But, let's put this as an action item.
[2016/01/09 11:12:03] <datahead7777> You could just make it so that swimmable water is represented differently than the kind of water that already existed in some levels
[2016/01/09 11:12:09] <Tobbi> We could also have a water entering animation...
[2016/01/09 11:12:11] <maths22> Karkus: Forest world and icyisland both have water
[2016/01/09 11:12:11] <datahead7777> (internally)
[2016/01/09 11:12:19] <mt> the thing is
[2016/01/09 11:12:22] <Karkus> maths22: Wrongly.

[2016/01/09 11:12:29] <mt> 'Don't use water'
[2016/01/09 11:12:33] <maths22> mt: Link?
[2016/01/09 11:12:34] <mt> 'unless it's finished'
[2016/01/09 11:12:47] <Hume2> Agree with mt.
[2016/01/09 11:12:58] <mt> http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Milestone_2_Design_Document/Styleguide#Other
[2016/01/09 11:12:59] <Hume2> It's really there-
[2016/01/09 11:13:07] <mt> "Avoid using any water. Swimming and water physics have not been finalized, so any current water behavior is unreliable. "
[2016/01/09 11:13:09] <Karkus> I am willing to personally fix every single level which uses water.
[2016/01/09 11:13:11] <maths22> Hume2: I wasn't saying it wasn't - I just wanted to see it
[2016/01/09 11:13:33] <Tobbi> Okay, fine, so we got an agreement and an action item.
[2016/01/09 11:13:39] <Hume2> Karkus: I could help you with that.
[2016/01/09 11:13:48] <mt> I'd also help
[2016/01/09 11:14:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: What's that supposed to mean?
[2016/01/09 11:14:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: action item?

[2016/01/09 11:14:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes.

[2016/01/09 11:15:19] <Tobbi> Thanks!
[2016/01/09 11:15:23] <mt> Tobbi: now you're almost founder
[2016/01/09 11:15:23] <Karkus> Everyone vote: http://www.strawpoll.me/6490674
[2016/01/09 11:15:51] <giby> Your welcome... Actually, grumbel get that too
[2016/01/09 11:15:52] <Tobbi> Karkus: I thought we settled that we will use swimming in water now and rewrite current levels.
[2016/01/09 11:16:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: If that's what we vote for.
[2016/01/09 11:16:42] <Karkus> Still people who need to vote :D
[2016/01/09 11:16:46] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/01/09 11:16:49] <Hume2> # vote
[2016/01/09 11:16:53] @ greatjulius joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/09 11:17:04] <giby> Hi greatjulius
[2016/01/09 11:17:09] <greatjulius> hi
[2016/01/09 11:17:40] <Karkus> Okay, it seems most people want to have all levels use it.
[2016/01/09 11:17:50] <Tobbi> greatjulius: Did you just drop in by chance? Because we're having a meeting right now.
[2016/01/09 11:17:54] <Karkus> Finally, before we finish, how will it be implemented?
[2016/01/09 11:18:08] <Karkus> s/finish/finish this topic/
[2016/01/09 11:18:08] <red_bot> Karkus meant: "Finally, before we finish this topic, how will it be implemented?"
[2016/01/09 11:18:08] <Hume2> Only three people voted.
[2016/01/09 11:18:29] <Karkus> Who didn't vote?
[2016/01/09 11:18:41] <Hume2> # ^^
[2016/01/09 11:18:51] <Tobbi> I just did.
[2016/01/09 11:18:51] <grumbel> So has anybody thought about swimming needing new graphics, new enemies and new everything?
[2016/01/09 11:18:57] <Karkus> Hume2: That's not a yes/no question.
[2016/01/09 11:18:59] <greatjulius> No, I saw the post on Twitter. I just wanet to join if I'm allowed. I'm not a random guy. I am interested in SuperTux.
[2016/01/09 11:19:15] <mt> sure
[2016/01/09 11:19:19] <Karkus> greatjulius: That's fine, don't forget to keep on topic, though!
[2016/01/09 11:19:20] <Tobbi> greatjulius: Good thing. We got a variety of things ahead of us in SuperTux development.
[2016/01/09 11:19:22] <Hume2> Karkus: Oh, I forgot.
[2016/01/09 11:19:24] <maths22> grumbel: That is a very good point
[2016/01/09 11:19:41] <mt> greatjulius: might want to see: https://www.strawpoll.me/6490674
[2016/01/09 11:19:58] <mt> the question is, if we want to drop the old water behavior
[2016/01/09 11:20:07] <maths22> I think we can manage graphics without tons of difficulty; the real question is coming up with new enemies
[2016/01/09 11:20:21] <Karkus> maths22: Hmmm...
[2016/01/09 11:20:27] <Tobbi> Huge task in my opinion, we need to devise new badguys...
[2016/01/09 11:20:33] <Tobbi> Maybe there's something that Tux can't do in water?
[2016/01/09 11:20:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: Fire fireballs.
[2016/01/09 11:20:48] <Tobbi> Possibly.
[2016/01/09 11:20:55] <Tobbi> This might counteract any advantage.
[2016/01/09 11:20:57] <Hume2> So we move to Forest again?
[2016/01/09 11:20:59] <mt> Karkus: not sure, fire works under water
[2016/01/09 11:21:03] <Karkus> Ice balls could create platforms to work on.
[2016/01/09 11:21:07] <mt> (see Magnesium)
[2016/01/09 11:21:27] <mt> iceflower shouldn't work under water, because it'd freeze everything
[2016/01/09 11:21:37] <Hume2> Not really.
[2016/01/09 11:21:50] <Hume2> Even Ice XI wouldn't.
[2016/01/09 11:22:00] <greatjulius> if you are IN water you would freeze yourself
[2016/01/09 11:22:01] <mt> what does Dr. Hume2 say about iceflower physics?
[2016/01/09 11:22:01] <giby> greatjulius, any valuable skills?
[2016/01/09 11:22:03] <mt> :D
[2016/01/09 11:22:26] <Hume2> Well, freeze...
[2016/01/09 11:22:26] <Karkus> mt: Anyway, this is somewhat irrelevant.
[2016/01/09 11:22:32] <Karkus> How will it be implemented?
[2016/01/09 11:22:33] <mt> yeah
[2016/01/09 11:22:36] <greatjulius> translating in german and maybe design
[2016/01/09 11:22:46] <Hume2> *sigh*
[2016/01/09 11:22:49] <mt> greatjulius: what design?
[2016/01/09 11:22:57] <Karkus> greatjulius: We've got plenty of Germans, can't get rid of them!
[2016/01/09 11:23:08] <greatjulius> I know @Karkus
[2016/01/09 11:23:17] <Hume2> off-topic!
[2016/01/09 11:23:18] <giby> I guess german translation is done...
[2016/01/09 11:23:22] <Tobbi> Yes, it is.
[2016/01/09 11:23:35] <giby> design... good at Gimp?
[2016/01/09 11:23:37] <Karkus> greatjulius: But, your ideas will be useful enough.
[2016/01/09 11:23:53] <Tobbi> greatjulius: We're talking about graphics design here, right?
[2016/01/09 11:23:56] <Karkus> Does anyone like my swimming idea?
[2016/01/09 11:24:09] <mt> Karkus: what swimming idea again?
[2016/01/09 11:24:12] <Hume2> Topic: Swimming.
[2016/01/09 11:24:18] <mt> so much people talking here, sorry, lost the topic
[2016/01/09 11:24:28] <Hume2> We still haven't changed it, sorry.
[2016/01/09 11:24:30] <greatjulius> i could do textures but im not really into and especially not in the style of supertux
[2016/01/09 11:24:41] <greatjulius> *into it
[2016/01/09 11:24:41] <Hume2> Ok, Topic: Graphics.
[2016/01/09 11:24:49] <Karkus> Hume2: no.
[2016/01/09 11:24:59] <Karkus> When did we come to a decision?
[2016/01/09 11:25:14] <Karkus> My swimming idea is like penguin mario is NSMB Wii
[2016/01/09 11:25:23] <Hume2> So topic: Swimming.
[2016/01/09 11:25:28] <Karkus> Hume2: What was your idea?
[2016/01/09 11:25:33] <Hume2> well...
[2016/01/09 11:25:33] <mt> I'll set +mz and devoice anyone not talking about swimming if we don't come to a solution
[2016/01/09 11:25:46] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2016/01/09 11:25:55] <Karkus> mt: Don't set +mz
[2016/01/09 11:26:14] <Karkus> mt: Almost all of us are voice as it is.
[2016/01/09 11:27:25] <Karkus> Now is anyone's final opportunity to speak up: What are your ideas for how swimming will be implemented?
[2016/01/09 11:27:51] <Karkus> Then I will make a poll, I guess.
[2016/01/09 11:28:01] <mt> wasn't there already that poll?
[2016/01/09 11:28:22] <Karkus> mt: That was: Where will swimming be implemented?
[2016/01/09 11:28:30] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/01/09 11:28:30] <mt> ah
[2016/01/09 11:28:32] <Karkus> mt: Not How.
[2016/01/09 11:28:48] <mt> so, I'd agree with: like in NSMB wii this penguin thing, but without bonus
[2016/01/09 11:29:01] <Karkus> mt: That is what I'm suggesting, yes.
[2016/01/09 11:29:13] <mt> re fire/ice/earth/airflower doesn't work: that can be talked about later
[2016/01/09 11:29:23] <maths22> That sounds like a reasonble model to me
[2016/01/09 11:29:28] <Hume2> OK, I'll agree.
[2016/01/09 11:29:32] <greatjulius> maybe swimming without a power up is very lame so player avoid water with ou a power up
[2016/01/09 11:29:49] <greatjulius> with lame i mean slow
[2016/01/09 11:30:00] <mt> well
[2016/01/09 11:30:06] <mt> penguins do swim very well
[2016/01/09 11:30:06] <Karkus> greatjulius: Okay, that can be considered for the future.
[2016/01/09 11:30:10] <mt> that's a fact
[2016/01/09 11:30:21] <Karkus> greatjulius: But not quite relevant now, I don't think.
[2016/01/09 11:30:24] <Karkus> Next topic:
[2016/01/09 11:30:29] <Hume2> Crawling.
[2016/01/09 11:30:37] <Karkus> I say no, tbh.
[2016/01/09 11:30:48] <mt> no, as well
[2016/01/09 11:30:49] <Karkus> If you're small, you are small.
[2016/01/09 11:30:56] <Hume2> You know, smashing large tux in a small passage is just silly.
[2016/01/09 11:31:23] <maths22> I also support not adding crawling
[2016/01/09 11:31:25] <polyphagia> ^
[2016/01/09 11:31:28] <mt> can we postpone that discussion for 0.6.0? at least?
[2016/01/09 11:31:29] <Tobbi> crawling? What difference would that make to walking?
[2016/01/09 11:31:34] <Tobbi> eeh making
[2016/01/09 11:31:38] <Tobbi> eh, wait.
[2016/01/09 11:31:43] <Hume2> Tobbi: only for big tux
[2016/01/09 11:31:44] <Tobbi> correct sentence, nvm
[2016/01/09 11:31:46] <Tobbi> ah.
[2016/01/09 11:31:54] <Tobbi> Hume2: But you can duck and jump to get there.
[2016/01/09 11:31:59] <Tobbi> So, not sure if I want thatz.
[2016/01/09 11:32:05] <Hume2> Yes, but it's teddious.

[2016/01/09 11:33:03] <Karkus> Answer: No!
[2016/01/09 11:33:07] <Karkus> Next: Sliding
[2016/01/09 11:33:11] <polyphagia> fun!
[2016/01/09 11:33:17] <Karkus> On his belly.
[2016/01/09 11:33:23] <polyphagia> the penguin suit in NSMB is great
[2016/01/09 11:33:29] <Hume2> Isn't that the same by the way?
[2016/01/09 11:33:32] <polyphagia> sliding is also in smb3 when you hold down on a slope
[2016/01/09 11:33:36] <polyphagia> and you can ride on your ass down a hill
[2016/01/09 11:33:37] <Tobbi> Sliding sounds like fun.
[2016/01/09 11:33:39] <polyphagia> to kill enemies
[2016/01/09 11:33:43] @ Quit: gryffyn: Quit: WeeChat 1.3
[2016/01/09 11:33:46] <Tobbi> And reminds me of tux racer.
[2016/01/09 11:33:46] <Hume2> Yes, it's fun.
[2016/01/09 11:33:46] <Karkus> Tobbi: It would be.
[2016/01/09 11:33:59] <Tobbi> So, tux would follow the slope.
[2016/01/09 11:34:06] <Karkus> # ---- vote: sliding ----
[2016/01/09 11:34:09] <Hume2> yes
[2016/01/09 11:34:09] <Karkus> yes
[2016/01/09 11:34:10] <polyphagia> i think it should be triggered by holding down like in smb3
[2016/01/09 11:34:12] <Tobbi> yes
[2016/01/09 11:34:12] <polyphagia> yeah
[2016/01/09 11:34:16] <greatjulius> yes, this would be a fast method of moving and useful for speedruns
[2016/01/09 11:34:21] <maths22> yes
[2016/01/09 11:34:21] <Tobbi> Do we have enough information about the slope to align the graphics?
[2016/01/09 11:34:34] <polyphagia> i think so
[2016/01/09 11:34:38] <Tobbi> ok. good.
[2016/01/09 11:34:50] <Karkus> So, 0.5.0 ?

[2016/01/09 11:37:27] <Hume2> OK.
[2016/01/09 11:37:29] <Tobbi> I think tux should wiggle his wings a little before sliding, would make a great animation ;)
[2016/01/09 11:37:29] <Karkus> Okay, someone make an issue for sliding, leave the milestone unspecified.
[2016/01/09 11:37:32] <polyphagia> are we still talking about sliding?

[2016/01/09 11:37:48] <Karkus> hume2's animations.
[2016/01/09 11:37:57] <Hume2> Yeah.
[2016/01/09 11:38:06] <mt> animations: should be more consistent
[2016/01/09 11:38:11] <polyphagia> we need running big tux
[2016/01/09 11:38:12] <Karkus> I think they're good, but improvements are needed ^
[2016/01/09 11:38:15] <mt> wasn't there an issue about that
[2016/01/09 11:38:18] <Hume2> Let's start with melting.
[2016/01/09 11:38:26] <Tobbi> I am okay with the burning animation, think the water melting animation needs more work, though.
[2016/01/09 11:38:42] <Hume2> Topic: Melting
[2016/01/09 11:38:42] <Karkus> Hume2: Can you make the burning animation give off light?
[2016/01/09 11:38:48] <Hume2> Karkus: Yes.

[2016/01/09 11:38:53] <polyphagia> i think it's fine that melting is done per sprite instead of as a general effect
[2016/01/09 11:38:57] <mt> okay with burning as well, having that as particle filter as suggested at some point would be cool tho
[2016/01/09 11:38:59] <polyphagia> it allows for more creativity
[2016/01/09 11:39:04] <polyphagia> and looks nicer
[2016/01/09 11:39:21] <Karkus> polyphagia: It should be optional. Melting is difficult to generalise anyway
[2016/01/09 11:39:27] <Hume2> And it's more fractal.
[2016/01/09 11:39:44] <polyphagia> it allows for the possibility of some cute effects too

[2016/01/09 11:39:59] <pentagon> [10addons] 07Grumbel opened issue 09#13: SuperTux 0.3.5a fails to parse repository file index-0_4_0.nfo 13http://git.io/vu5Vp
[2016/01/09 11:40:31] <Tobbi> yikes!
[2016/01/09 11:40:45] <Tobbi> what are we going to do?
[2016/01/09 11:40:47] <mt> 0.3.5a happened
[2016/01/09 11:40:51] <mt> it's not supported anymore
[2016/01/09 11:40:55] <Hume2> So melting. Ideas?
[2016/01/09 11:40:57] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/01/09 11:41:05] <mt> bug the package managers to patch the URL to the 0_3_5 nfo
[2016/01/09 11:41:08] <Karkus> Hume2: What ideas?
[2016/01/09 11:41:10] <mt> all we can do
[2016/01/09 11:41:35] <grumbel> mt: no, the bug is in the addon repository
[2016/01/09 11:41:43] <Karkus> mt: Technically we just became 1.0.0 :D
[2016/01/09 11:41:50] <Hume2> off-topic!
[2016/01/09 11:41:52] <mt> grumbel: why?
[2016/01/09 11:42:13] <Karkus> Guys, this is off-topic, please discuss in the issue comments.
[2016/01/09 11:42:14] <grumbel> 0_3_5a is a dev snapshot of 0.4.0
[2016/01/09 11:42:31] <mt> no, 0.3.5a is a bugfix release for 0.4.0
[2016/01/09 11:42:36] <Karkus> Hume2: What ideas do you want?
[2016/01/09 11:42:39] <mt> s/0.4.0/0.3.5
[2016/01/09 11:42:46] <Hume2> Karkus: For melting.
[2016/01/09 11:42:55] <maths22> mt, grumbel: topic
[2016/01/09 11:43:00] <Hume2> Please keep on-topic.
[2016/01/09 11:43:08] <Karkus> Hume2: It's good as it is, we just need to make LMH happy.
[2016/01/09 11:43:22] <polyphagia> yeah i never really found any problems with the melting sprite
[2016/01/09 11:43:23] <Hume2> And LMH isn't there...
[2016/01/09 11:43:24] <polyphagia> sprites*
[2016/01/09 11:43:38] <Karkus> Next: burning animation
[2016/01/09 11:43:39] <polyphagia> the game isn't real life, melting has been drawn in all sorts of ways
[2016/01/09 11:43:43] <mt> afk, you can continue your discussion :P
[2016/01/09 11:43:44] <Karkus> Should be a particle effect.
[2016/01/09 11:43:47] <Tobbi> I think that the bottom edge is too...sharp.
[2016/01/09 11:43:50] <Tobbi> Can this be improved?
[2016/01/09 11:43:54] <polyphagia> as long as it gives the impression of metling and looks presentable
[2016/01/09 11:44:11] <polyphagia> burning should be fast too
[2016/01/09 11:44:16] <Tobbi> It looks weird when the puddle edge is above the ground.
[2016/01/09 11:44:21] <polyphagia> look at how fast enemies are cleared with the fireball in smb
[2016/01/09 11:44:30] <polyphagia> it's satisfying to the player
[2016/01/09 11:44:38] <Hume2> Tobbi: That way it needs water physics.
[2016/01/09 11:44:45] <polyphagia> also the sound effect i dug up for burning in the issue comment would be satisfying to hear as well
[2016/01/09 11:44:49] <Tobbi> You're right, might be fairly difficult.
[2016/01/09 11:45:28] @ bb010g joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/09 11:46:16] <Karkus> Everyone: Can we move this discussion to the relevant issues?
[2016/01/09 11:46:27] <Tobbi> yes....let's carry on.
[2016/01/09 11:46:33] <Hume2> So Burning.
[2016/01/09 11:46:54] <Hume2> I think that that sound could be implemented.
[2016/01/09 11:46:55] <Karkus> Hume2: It needs to be a particle effect: next.
[2016/01/09 11:46:59] <Karkus> + sound.
[2016/01/09 11:47:13] <Karkus> Freezing
[2016/01/09 11:47:19] <Karkus> Should be generalised.
[2016/01/09 11:47:26] <Hume2> We are still at burning.
[2016/01/09 11:47:27] @ Quit: greatjulius: Quit: http://www.kiwiirc.com/ - A hand crafted IRC client
[2016/01/09 11:47:39] <Karkus> Hume2: No, we are at freezing.
[2016/01/09 11:47:49] <Karkus> Burning has been discussed already.
[2016/01/09 11:48:06] <Hume2> Karkus: We can change the topic only when noone has anything to say, but well, freezing.
[2016/01/09 11:48:19] <Tobbi> I'm okay with not animating freezing... since it happens instantly.
[2016/01/09 11:48:27] <Tobbi> But the graphics for that could need an overhaul, IMO
[2016/01/09 11:48:50] <Hume2> Yes, it could be improved.
[2016/01/09 11:49:16] <Tobbi> That could be something for a graphics designer.
[2016/01/09 11:49:23] <Tobbi> It's a well-defined task, IMO
[2016/01/09 11:49:30] <Hume2> Yes, it is.
[2016/01/09 11:49:42] <mt> back
[2016/01/09 11:49:44] <Tobbi> So, let's post on our social media channels about this.
[2016/01/09 11:50:48] <Hume2> OK.
[2016/01/09 11:51:01] <Hume2> Other ideas?
[2016/01/09 11:51:04] <grumbel> personally I would just remove all the actions, as they are useless.
[2016/01/09 11:51:18] <mt> well, if we had effects freezing would be easier to do for new badguys
[2016/01/09 11:51:30] <Tobbi> What actions? melting, freezing, burning?
[2016/01/09 11:51:34] <Tobbi> IMO they add variety...
[2016/01/09 11:51:45] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2016/01/09 11:51:48] <mt> freezing is neccessary, else badguys will look ugly
[2016/01/09 11:51:57] <mt> frozen badguys, of course
[2016/01/09 11:52:06] <Hume2> Yes. I know how it looks like.
[2016/01/09 11:52:10] <polyphagia> freezing is fine if it does something different imo
[2016/01/09 11:52:13] <polyphagia> like look at nsmb
[2016/01/09 11:52:16] <polyphagia> they turn into ice blocks
[2016/01/09 11:52:22] <polyphagia> and you can ground pound them
[2016/01/09 11:52:26] <polyphagia> sometimes pick them up
[2016/01/09 11:52:44] <polyphagia> you can even freeze an enemy mid-air for a few seconds
[2016/01/09 11:52:45] <grumbel> Tobbi: they serve no purpose, they just exist, but aren't really relevant to the gameplay
[2016/01/09 11:52:50] <polyphagia> this could be used to find secrets
[2016/01/09 11:52:53] <Hume2> Freezing should freeze, not make ice from nothing.
[2016/01/09 11:53:00] <Karkus> grumbel: Neither are background images
[2016/01/09 11:53:04] <Karkus> Let's remove those.
[2016/01/09 11:53:10] <polyphagia> well it could still freeze the enemy but be useful to the game i'm saying
[2016/01/09 11:53:18] <Karkus> *sarcasm
[2016/01/09 11:53:30] <Hume2> polyphagia: Rocks for free!
[2016/01/09 11:53:43] <Hume2> It could make levels easier.
[2016/01/09 11:54:02] <polyphagia> well
[2016/01/09 11:54:08] <polyphagia> that's why ice flower isn't given away in every level Hume2
[2016/01/09 11:54:14] <polyphagia> some might have to be changed
[2016/01/09 11:54:18] <polyphagia> not sure
[2016/01/09 11:55:00] <Hume2> When I wanted to do it, Tobbi didn'y like it, but maybe he changed his opinion.
[2016/01/09 11:55:02] <polyphagia> but  idon't think they should be as free as rocks
[2016/01/09 11:55:15] <polyphagia> maybe like a temporary platform that breaks easily?
[2016/01/09 11:55:24] <grumbel> Karkus: the point is that those actions add a ton of complications without providing any value
[2016/01/09 11:55:29] <Tobbi> Hume2: What specifically are we talking about? I didn't like so many things you did :D
[2016/01/09 11:55:30] <polyphagia> kind of like dunking something in liquid nitrogen Hume2
[2016/01/09 11:55:30] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/01/09 11:55:32] <polyphagia> is what i'm thinking
[2016/01/09 11:55:42] <Karkus> grumbel: To some extent, I agree.
[2016/01/09 11:55:47] <polyphagia> very brittle but useful for a few things perhaps
[2016/01/09 11:56:31] <Karkus> I think if you jump on them, they should shatter.
[2016/01/09 11:56:36] <grumbel> Adding even more graphics and stuff on top of them doesn't make the game better, it makes it just harder to make a good game out of it as the resistance to change increases
[2016/01/09 11:57:02] <Karkus> grumbel: What do you want to be removed?
[2016/01/09 11:57:08] <polyphagia> yeah Karkus that would be a good idea
[2016/01/09 11:57:26] <Hume2> There's already that shatter animation that Tobbi doesn't like...
[2016/01/09 11:57:34] <Tobbi> Ah, that one.
[2016/01/09 11:57:36] <polyphagia> shattering could be an effect
[2016/01/09 11:57:48] <polyphagia> a frozen enemy could be diced into pieces and scattered
[2016/01/09 11:57:49] <polyphagia> like breaking a box
[2016/01/09 11:57:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: I prefer individual shattering images for each badguys...
[2016/01/09 11:58:00] <polyphagia> oh ok
[2016/01/09 11:58:03] <polyphagia> either way is fine
[2016/01/09 11:58:06] <polyphagia> i don't really mind
[2016/01/09 11:58:17] <Tobbi> Like the shattering of that one crystal badguy.
[2016/01/09 11:58:21] <Tobbi> But, we can decide on that later.
[2016/01/09 11:58:30] <Tobbi> As I said; I do not want to be a lead figure for any of you.
[2016/01/09 11:58:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why? That just scares off graphics artists.
[2016/01/09 11:58:52] <polyphagia> i mean we could always try and see. it should be possible to make a pretty nice looking effect
[2016/01/09 11:58:53] <Tobbi> Karkus: It might look better...the shattering effect was coded.
[2016/01/09 11:58:57] <Tobbi> iirc.
[2016/01/09 11:59:07] <Tobbi> The shattering of the box graphics.
[2016/01/09 11:59:12] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/01/09 11:59:18] <polyphagia> there's a few ways to go about programmatic shatter effect
[2016/01/09 11:59:38] <polyphagia> and shattering for each enemy manually is a lot of work
[2016/01/09 11:59:50] <polyphagia> even if it did look a little better
[2016/01/09 11:59:56] <Karkus> # ---- vote: should the shattering effect be coded? ----
[2016/01/09 12:00:01] <polyphagia> yes
[2016/01/09 12:00:04] <Karkus> yes
[2016/01/09 12:00:04] <mt> what shattering effect?
[2016/01/09 12:00:10] <Tobbi> mt: Badguy shattering
[2016/01/09 12:00:13] <polyphagia> frozen ones
[2016/01/09 12:00:17] <Hume2> Excuse me for about 30 mis please.
[2016/01/09 12:00:17] <polyphagia> generally
[2016/01/09 12:00:23] <mt> is that already implemented?
[2016/01/09 12:00:41] <Tobbi> I think we could code a shattering effect, but it needs to be a better one...
[2016/01/09 12:00:52] <polyphagia> that's fine :P nobody's suggesting we make an ugly one
[2016/01/09 12:01:01] <Karkus> ^ lol
[2016/01/09 12:01:07] <mt> better than what?
[2016/01/09 12:01:08] <polyphagia> maybe watch some videos on liquid nitrogen
[2016/01/09 12:01:10] <polyphagia> for some ideas
[2016/01/09 12:01:12] <polyphagia> haha
[2016/01/09 12:01:14] <grumbel> Karkus: the problem is discussing adding more stuff on top of stuff that isn't very good to begin with
[2016/01/09 12:01:30] <polyphagia> grumbel: it's more just polishing the stuff we have i thought
[2016/01/09 12:01:35] <Karkus> grumbel: For example?
[2016/01/09 12:01:40] <grumbel> Karkus: we discuss swimming when we haven't even managed to make a good fire flower in a decade
[2016/01/09 12:01:46] <Tobbi> mt: Better than having a shattering effect that looks like the box breaking effect, but iced.
[2016/01/09 12:01:58] <mt> oh the breaking box
[2016/01/09 12:02:03] <Tobbi> yes
[2016/01/09 12:02:04] <Karkus> grumbel: Stop being pessimistic :P
[2016/01/09 12:02:18] <grumbel> butt-jump is also completely useless
[2016/01/09 12:02:22] <mt> what's a "good fireflower"?
[2016/01/09 12:02:24] <polyphagia> we're specifically discussing how to improve a flower though grumbel
[2016/01/09 12:02:29] <polyphagia> butt jump is FUN
[2016/01/09 12:02:37] <polyphagia> and some level designs can make use of it
[2016/01/09 12:02:45] <Karkus> grumbel: I think that at least some of what we've discussed so far should be possible.
[2016/01/09 12:03:03] <polyphagia> i don't want to change the subject, but buttjumping should stack with multiple boxes
[2016/01/09 12:03:12] <Karkus> I agree with grumbel: Butt jump pointless.
[2016/01/09 12:03:16] <mt> it's of use when there's a box containing coins on the ground but, no iceblock
[2016/01/09 12:03:24] <maths22> grumbel: How is butt-jumping pointless?
[2016/01/09 12:03:31] <polyphagia> and like i said, somebody could design a level with buttjumping in mind
[2016/01/09 12:03:42] <polyphagia> maybe with a stack of boxes touching the ground
[2016/01/09 12:03:47] <polyphagia> that covers an entrace
[2016/01/09 12:03:48] <Tobbi> There are levels with butt-jumping in mind.
[2016/01/09 12:03:56] <polyphagia> yeah
[2016/01/09 12:03:57] <Tobbi> Yes, that's already done...
[2016/01/09 12:04:00] <polyphagia> i don't think it's useless at all
[2016/01/09 12:04:03] <polyphagia> it varies the game
[2016/01/09 12:04:07] <maths22> Several secret areas are only accessible through butt-jumping
[2016/01/09 12:04:22] <polyphagia> i'm sick of having to justify why the parts that make the game fun are "useless" lol
[2016/01/09 12:04:36] <polyphagia> the entire point of the program is to waste your time :P
[2016/01/09 12:04:43] <mt> I'd rather like to see arguments that justify removing something
[2016/01/09 12:04:43] <maths22> It also is a good way to get rid of ice-blocks, and trigger bonus blocks without bothering going under them
[2016/01/09 12:04:57] <Karkus> polyphagia: But we want to make it fun
[2016/01/09 12:05:08] <grumbel> mt: I'd rather like to see arguments for keeping something
[2016/01/09 12:05:12] <Karkus> Okay, now this is off topic
[2016/01/09 12:05:22] <Tobbi> Where were we?
[2016/01/09 12:05:28] <mt> grumbel: what's broken with the current implementations?
[2016/01/09 12:05:30] <polyphagia> shattering
[2016/01/09 12:05:45] <mt> see above, there's plenty of things that butt-jumping is useful for
[2016/01/09 12:06:01] <Karkus> Butt-jumping is good how it is.
[2016/01/09 12:06:14] <mt> Karkus: let's listen to other people
[2016/01/09 12:06:22] <mt> they have an opinion as well
[2016/01/09 12:06:24] <Karkus> mt: What are other people saying?
[2016/01/09 12:06:31] <polyphagia> butt jumping could be expanded
[2016/01/09 12:06:39] <mt> grumbel wants to remove it
[2016/01/09 12:06:50] <polyphagia> like the snowman enemy
[2016/01/09 12:06:54] <Karkus> mt: I don't agree with that.
[2016/01/09 12:06:54] <polyphagia> a butt jump could kill him in one hit
[2016/01/09 12:07:13] <polyphagia> butt jumps could also make you jump higher on trampolines maybe?
[2016/01/09 12:07:14] <mt> Karkus: might be that you don't agree with that, but you should still listen to the arguments for removing it
[2016/01/09 12:07:20] <polyphagia> or maybe a certain sort of trampoline that's only acviated by it?
[2016/01/09 12:07:21] <mt> which I sadly haven't seen yet
[2016/01/09 12:07:22] <polyphagia> who knows
[2016/01/09 12:07:26] <grumbel> I don't necessarily want to remove it, I just want to have it have a reason to exist
[2016/01/09 12:07:34] <polyphagia> the point is: butt jumping is useful right now and can be made even more fun and useful
[2016/01/09 12:07:47] <grumbel> At the moment it's just kind of there and not really used in any of the main levels
[2016/01/09 12:07:56] <Karkus> grumbel: A fork in the road.
[2016/01/09 12:08:00] <grumbel> There are no enemies where you need it for, the animation looks rather lackluster
[2016/01/09 12:08:01] <mt> it's actually used in the first level on Icy Island
[2016/01/09 12:08:04] <Karkus> Uses it to block the switch.
[2016/01/09 12:08:05] <polyphagia> and it makes the game less boring by offering alternative means to destroy things
[2016/01/09 12:08:09] <polyphagia> i use it all of the time
[2016/01/09 12:08:39] <mt> grumbel: it's the only way of destroying iceblocks without fireflower or making it fall down somewhere
[2016/01/09 12:08:40] <polyphagia> i don't care that it's not as efficient or useful, it's just nice to change the pace
[2016/01/09 12:09:14] <polyphagia> grumbel: there *could* be enemies that need it though
[2016/01/09 12:09:23] <polyphagia> or that change behaviour when it's used
[2016/01/09 12:09:36] <mt> polyphagia: open an issue for which enemies it could be used
[2016/01/09 12:09:49] <polyphagia> i'm only aware of the snowman
[2016/01/09 12:09:52] <polyphagia> i'll take a look at the list
[2016/01/09 12:10:17] <Karkus> Can we move on now? Anyone got more to add?
[2016/01/09 12:10:25] <Tobbi> Not for this point.
[2016/01/09 12:10:38] <Karkus> Okay, scripting.
[2016/01/09 12:10:44] <polyphagia> oh
[2016/01/09 12:10:47] <polyphagia> mrtree too mt
[2016/01/09 12:10:51] <polyphagia> ok i'll make an issue
[2016/01/09 12:10:54] <grumbel> polyphagia: yes, that's the point. We currently have a whole bunch of actions and bonuses, some of them could be made useful. But that requires some focus so that in the end you have three things that work really well, instead of ten that are a half done mess
[2016/01/09 12:11:11] <polyphagia> i'm specifically talking about butt jumping and i don't think it's half baked
[2016/01/09 12:11:19] <mt> I agree with improving current features before
[2016/01/09 12:11:20] <polyphagia> i know what you mean but i don't think it applies to butt jumping
[2016/01/09 12:11:27] <Karkus> grumbel: butt-jumping is not "A half-done mess"
[2016/01/09 12:11:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: Let me find that scripting issue first.
[2016/01/09 12:11:35] <polyphagia> we're trying to talk about how to improve butt jumping, not remove it because it isn't used enough
[2016/01/09 12:11:45] <Karkus> grumbel: What other "half-done mess"s are you talking about?
[2016/01/09 12:11:52] <polyphagia> not everything needs to be used in every level
[2016/01/09 12:13:41] <Karkus> Does any body have any answers to the question "What do interesting levels actually comprise?"
[2016/01/09 12:13:55] <grumbel> Karkus: most of the enemies, most of forest world, even main island is full of little bugs
[2016/01/09 12:14:32] <Karkus> grumbel: Code bugs?
[2016/01/09 12:15:16] <maths22> Karkus: One that I enjoy playing :p
[2016/01/09 12:15:16] <grumbel> Karkus: wrong tiles, wrong backgrounds, etc.
[2016/01/09 12:15:24] <maths22> I'm actually not sure how to give a good definition
[2016/01/09 12:15:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: Maybe my question wasn't thought through.
[2016/01/09 12:16:01] <Tobbi> Would be fine with skipping it.
[2016/01/09 12:16:33] <Tobbi> Just thinking about whether we need to add more level features to make levels more fun playing.
[2016/01/09 12:16:34] <Karkus> grumbel: The forest world is set to be redone anyway, and that will take a while. The main island is good, as far as I know
[2016/01/09 12:16:37] <Tobbi> or something.
[2016/01/09 12:16:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: I think we should, yes.
[2016/01/09 12:17:02] <Tobbi> OKay.
[2016/01/09 12:17:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: But, we have no ideas to discuss, so we can skip for now.
[2016/01/09 12:17:23] <Tobbi> Yes, let's do it.
[2016/01/09 12:17:27] <Tobbi> We're done, aren't we?
[2016/01/09 12:17:36] <Karkus> Check again.
[2016/01/09 12:17:37] <maths22> Tobbi: I think we are
[2016/01/09 12:17:44] * Tobbi checks
[2016/01/09 12:17:58] <Tobbi> Oh.
[2016/01/09 12:18:04] <Tobbi> Some items have been added.
[2016/01/09 12:18:11] <Tobbi>  Implement @LMH0013 's powerups and the ice flower in some levels
[2016/01/09 12:18:13] <Karkus> Namely:
[2016/01/09 12:18:15] <Tobbi> Sounds good.
[2016/01/09 12:18:15] <Karkus> Implement @LMH0013 's powerups and the ice flower in some levels
[2016/01/09 12:18:28] <Tobbi>  Which wiki poll -> #208
[2016/01/09 12:18:29] <Karkus> I think we should use the air powerup on the sky levels.
[2016/01/09 12:18:43] <Tobbi> If it doesn't make them too easy, sure.
[2016/01/09 12:18:48] <Karkus> Where it seems more appropriate.
[2016/01/09 12:18:55] <polyphagia> air powerup?
[2016/01/09 12:19:04] <polyphagia> do we have one?
[2016/01/09 12:19:10] <Karkus> polyphagia: Yes, no-one has added it to levels
[2016/01/09 12:19:15] <polyphagia> oh ok
[2016/01/09 12:19:25] <Karkus> We can save the ice and earth powerups for later worlds I suppose.
[2016/01/09 12:19:27] <Tobbi> polyphagia: It is in LMH's levels.
[2016/01/09 12:19:32] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2016/01/09 12:19:35] <Karkus> Any objections
[2016/01/09 12:19:37] <Karkus> ?
[2016/01/09 12:20:20] <Tobbi> nope.
[2016/01/09 12:20:22] <Tobbi> Let's move on.
[2016/01/09 12:20:25] <Karkus> Okay, final point. What are we to do about the wikis?
[2016/01/09 12:20:36] <mt> Move to GitHub
[2016/01/09 12:20:50] <Tobbi> I am for moving things to the github one, and while doing that revising its content.
[2016/01/09 12:20:59] <mt> before someone says GitHub is too centralized no, it's not
[2016/01/09 12:21:11] <Tobbi> Having everything in one place makes it way easier for new contributors to get started.
[2016/01/09 12:21:14] <mt> since everything but issues is managed as git repo
[2016/01/09 12:21:20] <pentagon> [10supertux] 07misterhat opened issue 09#324: Butt jumping should do more damage to certain enemies 13http://git.io/vu5D3
[2016/01/09 12:21:57] <mt> Tobbi: +1
[2016/01/09 12:22:20] <mt> can we remove https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/The-Team
[2016/01/09 12:22:21] <Tobbi> The old wiki is a mess, actually.
[2016/01/09 12:22:24] <Hume2> Could anyone summarize me what has been decided in a PM?
[2016/01/09 12:22:32] <Tobbi> Hume2: There will be action items...
[2016/01/09 12:22:36] <Tobbi> Someone just needs to go through the log.
[2016/01/09 12:22:50] <Tobbi> mt: I'd say so.
[2016/01/09 12:22:57] <Tobbi> The team is comprised of different people now.
[2016/01/09 12:23:41] <polyphagia> it's also redundant
[2016/01/09 12:23:48] <polyphagia> because github lists the contributors anyway
[2016/01/09 12:23:58] <polyphagia> and people can choose what they want to put on their github profile
[2016/01/09 12:24:04] <grumbel> Is there any way to dump all the old Mediawiki into a git repo?
[2016/01/09 12:24:07] <Tobbi> yeah, ok
[2016/01/09 12:24:20] <Tobbi> let's see...
[2016/01/09 12:24:22] <mt> grumbel: do you have access to the database?
[2016/01/09 12:24:34] <Karkus> I disagree polyphagia, as some old members wouldn't want to be contacted anymore, I don't think.
[2016/01/09 12:24:48] <mt> what's possible is to use MediaWiki formatted content for GitHub
[2016/01/09 12:24:50] <polyphagia> why do you disagree then Karkus ?
[2016/01/09 12:24:55] <polyphagia> i'm for removing the page
[2016/01/09 12:24:56] <mt> but we want to get rid of the bad wiki content
[2016/01/09 12:25:03] <Karkus> polyphagia: I just said why...
[2016/01/09 12:25:18] <polyphagia> but you don't disagree Karkus
[2016/01/09 12:25:22] <polyphagia> i think the page should be removed
[2016/01/09 12:25:38] <polyphagia> old members being contacted is another reason to remove it
[2016/01/09 12:26:00] <Hume2> So the theme is wiki, right?
[2016/01/09 12:26:00] <Karkus> polyphagia: Maybe, or update it...
[2016/01/09 12:26:05] <polyphagia> that too
[2016/01/09 12:26:12] <mt> ----- topic: wiki -----
[2016/01/09 12:26:20] <polyphagia> i think it should be manually converted
[2016/01/09 12:26:24] <polyphagia> since there's some bad content
[2016/01/09 12:26:27] <Karkus> Agreed.
[2016/01/09 12:26:29] <polyphagia> or half baked
[2016/01/09 12:26:35] <Tobbi> Agreed, but we need someone to actually do it.
[2016/01/09 12:26:44] <mt> yes
[2016/01/09 12:26:45] <polyphagia> but i think you should open up the wiki to let non contributors edit it
[2016/01/09 12:26:46] <Tobbi> It's gonna be a tremendous effort, IMO
[2016/01/09 12:26:53] <polyphagia> people who make levels might have important info to add to the wiki
[2016/01/09 12:26:55] <Hume2> Yes, but something must be done with that list of pages.
[2016/01/09 12:26:57] <polyphagia> but they haven't actually coded for supertux
[2016/01/09 12:27:06] <polyphagia> as long as you have a github account, you should be allowed to edit the wiki
[2016/01/09 12:27:07] <mt> ----- subtopic: non-contributors editing the wiki -----
[2016/01/09 12:27:07] <Tobbi> Let's hope we don't get spammed.
[2016/01/09 12:27:17] <Tobbi> How do we prevent spam?
[2016/01/09 12:27:22] <polyphagia> that's github's job Tobbi
[2016/01/09 12:27:24] <mt> I had suggested using readthedocs as wiki
[2016/01/09 12:27:34] <mt> and then making a separate git repo
[2016/01/09 12:27:35] <polyphagia> we don't have to manually deal with spam and bots because github supplies that for us
[2016/01/09 12:27:39] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/01/09 12:27:40] <Hume2> Maybe only some pages.
[2016/01/09 12:27:42] <polyphagia> if it happens
[2016/01/09 12:27:43] <mt> where people can submit content as PRs
[2016/01/09 12:27:46] <polyphagia> we can always revert the change Tobbi
[2016/01/09 12:27:47] <Tobbi> So, if that's in place, that's good.
[2016/01/09 12:27:52] <maths22> mt: I personally like that concept
[2016/01/09 12:28:02] <Tobbi> Would be fragmented, though.
[2016/01/09 12:28:06] <polyphagia> i say leave it open, see what comes of it and if you see poor quality content consistently or spam, close it back up
[2016/01/09 12:28:17] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2016/01/09 12:28:17] <polyphagia> but i highly doubt it'll be spammed
[2016/01/09 12:28:26] <mt> if we open up the wiki to non contributors its history will be spammed even more than it is now
[2016/01/09 12:28:34] <mt> it's impossible to see what change changed what
[2016/01/09 12:28:44] <polyphagia> it's being spammed now?
[2016/01/09 12:28:47] <Karkus> mt: The mediawiki doesn't even havea  history.
[2016/01/09 12:28:51] <mt> I rebased some parts of the repo at some point
[2016/01/09 12:28:54] <mt> Karkus: it does
[2016/01/09 12:28:54] <grumbel> mt: I think I have access to the supertux-wiki database
[2016/01/09 12:28:54] <polyphagia> the current github wiki is pretty much useless
[2016/01/09 12:28:57] <polyphagia> i haven't used it once
[2016/01/09 12:29:10] <polyphagia> i don't think we need to be worry about the history logs being "spammed"
[2016/01/09 12:29:18] <polyphagia> by people trying to contribute
[2016/01/09 12:29:23] <mt> Karkus: example: http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/index.php?title=Download&action=history
[2016/01/09 12:29:40] <Karkus> grumbel: Not an issue, we need to get rid of it.
[2016/01/09 12:30:05] <mt> we should keep an archive of the wiki
[2016/01/09 12:30:06] <Karkus> mt: Okay, fair enough
[2016/01/09 12:30:08] <grumbel> Karkus: yes, but I would like to migrate the whole history, not just copy&paste the latest version
[2016/01/09 12:30:08] <mt> old wiki
[2016/01/09 12:30:11] <polyphagia> the wiki shows up often on google
[2016/01/09 12:30:17] <polyphagia> people might stumble upon it by accident
[2016/01/09 12:30:21] <polyphagia> it needs an archive warning
[2016/01/09 12:30:22] <Tobbi> Oh, yeah.
[2016/01/09 12:30:36] <polyphagia> or somebody could add it to archive.org
[2016/01/09 12:30:39] <polyphagia> and we can just remove it
[2016/01/09 12:30:41] <polyphagia> :P
[2016/01/09 12:30:43] <mt> polyphagia: +1 for archive.org
[2016/01/09 12:30:56] <polyphagia> i think it'd be too confusing for people trying to find out how to do things and being led to it
[2016/01/09 12:31:06] <Tobbi> Problem with the old wiki is also a potentially vulnerable mediawiki version.
[2016/01/09 12:31:12] <polyphagia> there's really no reason to archive it if we port over all the important content to the new wiki
[2016/01/09 12:31:14] <mt> # ---- vote: import whole history to new wiki ----
[2016/01/09 12:31:14] <Tobbi> Or is that up-to-date?
[2016/01/09 12:31:20] <polyphagia> no
[2016/01/09 12:31:21] <Tobbi> yes
[2016/01/09 12:31:24] <mt> no
[2016/01/09 12:31:26] <Hume2> no
[2016/01/09 12:31:32] <Karkus> mt: What does that mean?
[2016/01/09 12:31:38] <grumbel> yes
[2016/01/09 12:31:44] <mt> Karkus: keep all the history in mediawiki in the new repo
[2016/01/09 12:31:54] <Karkus> mt: As an archive?
[2016/01/09 12:31:59] <mt> no
[2016/01/09 12:32:01] <mt> not as an archive
[2016/01/09 12:32:07] <Karkus> mt: As what?
[2016/01/09 12:32:13] <mt> I don't know why
[2016/01/09 12:32:27] <mt> I just think we need to start from scratch
[2016/01/09 12:32:33] <polyphagia> agreed
[2016/01/09 12:32:35] <mt> the old wiki contains too much bullshit
[2016/01/09 12:32:42] <grumbel> as regular history, import old wiki into new, rebase new wiki ontop of old and be done with it
[2016/01/09 12:32:43] <Hume2> What's the potential usage of this history?
[2016/01/09 12:32:45] @ LMH joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/09 12:32:45] @ Mode +v LMH by ChanServ
[2016/01/09 12:32:51] <mt> and I don't even know if it's possible to keep the mediawiki history
[2016/01/09 12:32:55] <Tobbi> Hello, LMH
[2016/01/09 12:33:14] <Karkus> LMH: Current topic: Wiki.
[2016/01/09 12:33:33] <polyphagia> one of the most useful pages on the old wiki was the level format
[2016/01/09 12:33:33] <Hume2> I think that 50% of those pages would be rewritten anyway, so why keep the history?
[2016/01/09 12:33:40] <LMH> Morning Tobbi, thanks Karkus
[2016/01/09 12:33:47] <mt> grumbel: I wonder if it would be possible to get to history and all the old wiki uploaded to archive.org
[2016/01/09 12:33:53] <mt> and then just start from scratch
[2016/01/09 12:33:58] <Tobbi> LMH: In case you don't know, we're having a meeting right now.
[2016/01/09 12:34:01] <mt> and we'll still have an archive of the history
[2016/01/09 12:34:10] <Tobbi> It's been going on for the past 2.5 hours
[2016/01/09 12:34:13] <grumbel> I'd much prefer to just have it in git
[2016/01/09 12:34:13] <polyphagia> httrack mt :P

[2016/01/09 12:34:44] <polyphagia> also Karkus can you tag my issue?
[2016/01/09 12:35:03] <mt> grumbel: then all the history will be polluted with old content
[2016/01/09 12:35:10] <polyphagia> oh mr iceblock too can be killed, i'll add that
[2016/01/09 12:35:10] <mt> which isn't really what we want
[2016/01/09 12:35:18] <pentagon> [10addons] 07brmbrmcar commented on issue 09#13: SuperTux 0.3.5a fails to parse repository file index-0_4_0.nfo 13http://git.io/vu5Vp
[2016/01/09 12:35:41] <grumbel> mt: old history doesn't polute anything, as it will be deep down in the history where it belongs
[2016/01/09 12:36:12] <mt> well, can you look if there's a way to import the old history?
[2016/01/09 12:37:20] <mt> you could ask #mediawiki
[2016/01/09 12:37:34] <Karkus> polyphagia: Mr Ice Block is already implemented in that regard
[2016/01/09 12:38:07] <polyphagia> oh ok
[2016/01/09 12:38:12] <polyphagia> not sure why he commented then
[2016/01/09 12:38:14] <polyphagia> i'll edit it out
[2016/01/09 12:38:15] <Tobbi> Is this our last topic?
[2016/01/09 12:38:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes, although there might be some to revisit.
[2016/01/09 12:38:40] <Tobbi> Seems like it.
[2016/01/09 12:38:41] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/01/09 12:38:45] <Hume2> And does anyone want to revert anything that was edited in the wiki so far?
[2016/01/09 12:38:52] <Tobbi> The wiki is huge.
[2016/01/09 12:38:59] <Karkus> mt: You might want to update the M3 design document.
[2016/01/09 12:38:59] <Tobbi> How would we know whether we want to revert something at this point.
[2016/01/09 12:39:31] <Hume2> Do you feel like it?
[2016/01/09 12:39:35] <mt> # ---- vote: what system should be used for the new wiki (github wiki (gollum)/readthedocs and github PRs) ----
[2016/01/09 12:39:48] <Tobbi> I'm undecided.
[2016/01/09 12:39:56] <Tobbi> So, no vote from me.
[2016/01/09 12:40:00] <mt> I'd suggest readthedocs
[2016/01/09 12:40:02] <mt> It's nice
[2016/01/09 12:40:07] <Hume2> So b)
[2016/01/09 12:40:08] <polyphagia> isn't readthedocs for python?
[2016/01/09 12:40:10] <mt> and it's easy to manage contributions
[2016/01/09 12:40:18] <mt> polyphagia: it uses sphinx
[2016/01/09 12:40:19] <Karkus> Why does readthedocs need PRs?
[2016/01/09 12:40:19] <grumbel> http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki-dump-2016-01-09.xml
[2016/01/09 12:40:28] <polyphagia> readthedocs isn't for wikis is it?
[2016/01/09 12:40:35] <polyphagia> i thought it was mostly use for python documentation
[2016/01/09 12:40:38] <polyphagia> used*
[2016/01/09 12:40:47] <mt> polyphagia: it's for documentation, but we can also use it as contributor's wiki
[2016/01/09 12:41:00] <polyphagia> oh
[2016/01/09 12:41:01] <polyphagia> meh
[2016/01/09 12:41:06] <polyphagia> i'd say github wiki
[2016/01/09 12:41:07] <Karkus> mt: But is it a mess to contribute to?
[2016/01/09 12:41:32] <mt> It's changing reStructuredText files (similar format to markdown)
[2016/01/09 12:42:06] <Karkus> mt: Is there an edit button?
[2016/01/09 12:42:09] <Karkus> like the wikis?
[2016/01/09 12:42:14] <Karkus> Or do you have to use git?
[2016/01/09 12:42:21] <mt> no, you'd contribute as pull requests
[2016/01/09 12:42:31] <mt> which is actually quite a nice way for moderating the wiki
[2016/01/09 12:42:32] <Karkus> mt: That's bad
[2016/01/09 12:42:42] <mt> it's not that hard and not that abusable
[2016/01/09 12:42:50] <Karkus> mt: No, we want everyone to be able to contribute
[2016/01/09 12:42:58] <Karkus> Even if they don't know git
[2016/01/09 12:43:00] <mt> then the history will be polluted
[2016/01/09 12:43:09] <mt> as they don't know how to correctly set commit messages
[2016/01/09 12:43:20] <Karkus> mt: Why do we need the history?
[2016/01/09 12:43:30] <Hume2> You know, all those people saying that they don't understand git...
[2016/01/09 12:43:32] <mt> because it might be useful for people
[2016/01/09 12:43:45] <Karkus> mt: In what circumstances?
[2016/01/09 12:44:03] <mt> archiving is sadly forgotten in this digital world. why not preserve the project's history?
[2016/01/09 12:44:08] <Karkus> I vote GitHub
[2016/01/09 12:44:32] <Karkus> mt: I'm not against archiving.
[2016/01/09 12:44:46] <Karkus> Actually, I retract my vote.
[2016/01/09 12:44:50] <mt> yes but the git history of gollum will be polluted as hell
[2016/01/09 12:44:51] <Karkus> I'm undecided.
[2016/01/09 12:44:53] <mt> really
[2016/01/09 12:44:53] @ andre__ joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/09 12:45:13] @ andre__ left channel #supertux ()
[2016/01/09 12:45:33] <Hume2> That's true.
[2016/01/09 12:45:36] <Karkus> Is anyone against readthedocs?
[2016/01/09 12:45:43] <Karkus> I don't mind.
[2016/01/09 12:45:50] <Hume2> I don't mind too.
[2016/01/09 12:45:57] <mt> readthedocs, or what would be possible as well
[2016/01/09 12:45:58] <Tobbi> neither do I.
[2016/01/09 12:46:01] <mt> is jekyll or hugo
[2016/01/09 12:46:12] <mt> that might be more suited for wikis
[2016/01/09 12:46:14] <Karkus> grumbel, LMH: Any opinions?
[2016/01/09 12:46:29] <mt> https://jekyllrb.com/ or http://gohugo.io/
[2016/01/09 12:46:30] <grumbel> I want a proper git repository for hosting it, I don't really care much about the rest, but I don't see much reason to not use Github
[2016/01/09 12:47:30] <LMH> I'm pretty ambivalent honestly
[2016/01/09 12:48:03] <Hume2> So decided?
[2016/01/09 12:48:17] <mt> # ---- vote: readthedocs, jekyll, hugo ----
[2016/01/09 12:48:22] <grumbel> What reasons are there against github?
[2016/01/09 12:48:27] <Hume2> readthedocs
[2016/01/09 12:48:43] <mt> not really decided yet, readthedocs or hugo
[2016/01/09 12:48:53] <Karkus> idk anything about jekyll or hugo
[2016/01/09 12:49:14] <Tobbi> I think we should strive for having everything on github...
[2016/01/09 12:49:15] <mt> what jekyll and hugo (especially hugo) might allow better is structuring everything as wiki
[2016/01/09 12:49:53] <mt> Tobbi: jekyll and hugo could be generated to a static site which can be hosted as page on SuperTux.github.io/...
[2016/01/09 12:49:58] <grumbel> mt: How do they work internally? SQL database or git repo?
[2016/01/09 12:50:08] <mt> grumbel: git repo and static site generating
[2016/01/09 12:50:27] <Karkus> mt: Or wiki.supertuxproject.org
[2016/01/09 12:50:42] <mt> jekyll from markdown and textile, hugo from markdown, asciidoc, restructuredtext, (almost anything)
[2016/01/09 12:50:47] <Karkus> mt: I think readthedocs is for documentation, not wikis.
[2016/01/09 12:50:53] <mt> Karkus: yeah, it could be set up as CNAME
[2016/01/09 12:51:13] <mt> yeah, readthedocs is for documentation; that's why I also proposed jekyll and hugo
[2016/01/09 12:51:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: And this would still be on GitHub
[2016/01/09 12:51:20] <mt> jekyll is more for blogs tho
[2016/01/09 12:51:20] <Tobbi> right, fine with me.
[2016/01/09 12:51:31] <mt> hugo is for everything
[2016/01/09 12:51:37] <Karkus> mt: If hugo serves the purpose, I guess
[2016/01/09 12:51:38] <grumbel> mt: Any reason for not just using Github?
[2016/01/09 12:51:52] <mt> grumbel: not being able to really control contributions
[2016/01/09 12:51:55] <Hume2> Is there any possibility that we'll ever decide that?
[2016/01/09 12:52:10] <mt> in the end with github, we'll end up with bullshit content again
[2016/01/09 12:52:11] <polyphagia> doesn't the github wiki use a rpeo
[2016/01/09 12:52:11] <Karkus> mt: Can we control contributions to hugo?
[2016/01/09 12:52:12] <polyphagia> repo*
[2016/01/09 12:52:22] <polyphagia> what bullshit content did we have before mt ?
[2016/01/09 12:52:23] <mt> Karkus: yeah, as git repo
[2016/01/09 12:52:23] <Karkus> mt: Why is hugo any different?
[2016/01/09 12:52:36] <polyphagia> some of the things on the wiki might've been unfinished, but i wouldn't say it as bullshit lol
[2016/01/09 12:52:37] <Karkus> mt: But still requires the use of Git...
[2016/01/09 12:52:52] <polyphagia> making more barriers to contribute doesn't solve the problem of unfinished content
[2016/01/09 12:53:03] <Karkus> polyphagia: I agree
[2016/01/09 12:53:04] <polyphagia> making wikis as easy as possible for anybody to contribute makes a better wiki
[2016/01/09 12:53:05] <grumbel> mt: https://help.github.com/articles/changing-access-permissions-for-wikis/
[2016/01/09 12:53:05] <mt> polyphagia: silly ideas, unstructured content, not really clarity about what's recent and what's outdated
[2016/01/09 12:53:06] <polyphagia> not walling it off
[2016/01/09 12:53:26] <mt> grumbel: we've had that enabled, actually
[2016/01/09 12:53:30] <polyphagia> well mt at least there *was* content, wikis generally work that way
[2016/01/09 12:53:32] <mt> but people wanted to make it more open
[2016/01/09 12:53:34] <Karkus> Also, GitHub isn't very organised.
[2016/01/09 12:53:37] <polyphagia> start out more unstructured, slowly get better
[2016/01/09 12:53:48] <mt> Karkus: indeed. GitHub doesn't have any menus or so
[2016/01/09 12:53:56] <mt> well, not really
[2016/01/09 12:54:02] <mt> besides that silly navbar
[2016/01/09 12:54:03] <polyphagia> but i'm not saying we use the github wiki either
[2016/01/09 12:54:15] <polyphagia> i'm just saying make it *very* easy to contribute to
[2016/01/09 12:54:17] <polyphagia> whatever you choose
[2016/01/09 12:54:33] <polyphagia> don't be too worried about getting some poorer content
[2016/01/09 12:54:35] <mt> I'd say creating a github account and pull requesting a repo is easier
[2016/01/09 12:54:36] <polyphagia> that's what wikis are for
[2016/01/09 12:54:40] <mt> than waiting for a wiki admin
[2016/01/09 12:54:45] <polyphagia> that isn't easier
[2016/01/09 12:54:46] <polyphagia> IMO
[2016/01/09 12:54:47] <mt> I don't even know who that is right now
[2016/01/09 12:54:49] <polyphagia> that's a lot harder
[2016/01/09 12:54:58] <polyphagia> there are going to be non-programmers who want to change things
[2016/01/09 12:55:07] <polyphagia> maybe level editors
[2016/01/09 12:55:08] <Karkus> mt: They could also fork, and edit the text in their fork, without git?
[2016/01/09 12:55:10] <mt> people had to ask on irc before
[2016/01/09 12:55:17] <mt> Karkus: yes
[2016/01/09 12:55:24] <polyphagia> that would work
[2016/01/09 12:55:27] <mt> that's what pull requesting is about
[2016/01/09 12:55:31] <polyphagia> if they can do it all through the website UI
[2016/01/09 12:55:34] <polyphagia> then it's fine
[2016/01/09 12:55:42] <Hume2> OK
[2016/01/09 12:55:47] <Karkus> mt: If you make an easy tutorial explaining, I think it's a good idea.
[2016/01/09 12:55:57] <mt> yeah
[2016/01/09 12:56:02] <polyphagia> you could explain it with like three images
[2016/01/09 12:56:05] <polyphagia> and a blurb
[2016/01/09 12:56:06] <polyphagia> so that'd be good
[2016/01/09 12:56:08] <mt> we'd have to set up the repo first tho
[2016/01/09 12:56:20] <polyphagia> ok great ideas
[2016/01/09 12:56:21] <Karkus> mt: That's your job.
[2016/01/09 12:56:31] <mt> I'll do once I have time
[2016/01/09 12:56:34] <Karkus> Is this the end of the meeting?
[2016/01/09 12:56:41] <Tobbi> we're 3 hours in.
[2016/01/09 12:56:50] <Tobbi> So, I guess so.
[2016/01/09 12:56:52] <Karkus> How many lines?
[2016/01/09 12:56:58] <Tobbi> I don't know.
[2016/01/09 12:56:59] <mt> Tobbi: can you create a `wiki` repo?
[2016/01/09 12:57:05] <Tobbi> mt: Yes, one moment.
[2016/01/09 12:57:11] <polyphagia> who will declare MEETING ADJOURNED ?!
[2016/01/09 12:57:35] <Hume2> I think we should leave this topic and discuss the other things.
[2016/01/09 12:57:36] <Tobbi> mt: https://github.com/SuperTux/wiki
[2016/01/09 12:57:40] <mt> maths22: you, could you please set up wiki.supertuxproject.org as CNAME for github?
[2016/01/09 12:57:47] <Karkus> Hume2: What else it there to discuss?
[2016/01/09 12:58:02] <Hume2> Karkus: Scripting...
[2016/01/09 12:58:16] <polyphagia> YES
[2016/01/09 12:58:19] <polyphagia> i'm the first star on the wiki
[2016/01/09 12:58:23] <Karkus> Can we save this for next meeting?
[2016/01/09 12:58:24] <Hume2> Anyway we still haven't decided that freezing, did we?
[2016/01/09 12:58:37] <Karkus> Hume2: Yes, it's going to be a shatter effect.
[2016/01/09 12:58:47] <Hume2> Programmed?
[2016/01/09 12:58:47] <polyphagia> it's just going to have to look nicer than boxes is all
[2016/01/09 12:58:54] <Karkus> Hume2: Yes.
[2016/01/09 12:59:04] <Hume2> I'll note.
[2016/01/09 12:59:05] <Tobbi> PHEW!
[2016/01/09 12:59:15] <Tobbi> Guys, this was...intense.
[2016/01/09 12:59:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: Can you declare meeting adjourned?
[2016/01/09 12:59:27] <Tobbi> Meeting adjourned.
[2016/01/09 12:59:32] <Karkus> YAY!
[2016/01/09 12:59:39] <Tobbi> ====== END OF MEETING ======
[2016/01/09 12:59:46] * Tobbi sighs in relief.
[2016/01/09 12:59:52] <polyphagia> ====== END OF END OF MEETING ======
[2016/01/09 12:59:59] <Karkus> Okay, The logs will end with that message. ^^^
[2016/01/09 13:00:17] <polyphagia> watch your regex now
[2016/01/09 13:00:19] <polyphagia> :)
[2016/01/09 13:00:20] <Karkus> maths22: Did you log it?
[2016/01/09 13:00:24] <polyphagia> i logged it
[2016/01/09 13:00:28] <polyphagia> not on purpose but i have it lol
[2016/01/09 13:00:39] <Karkus> Someone who can edit the wiki.
[2016/01/09 13:00:42] <Tobbi> We talked for 3 hours...
[2016/01/09 13:00:46] <Karkus> I will start going through it.
[2016/01/09 13:00:49] <Tobbi> 3 frickin' hours
[2016/01/09 13:00:56] <polyphagia> yeah please don't post the whole thing imo
[2016/01/09 13:01:09] <Karkus> polyphagia: For now, and we can edit some things out.
[2016/01/09 13:01:17] <Tobbi> We need more devs to help us with the things we discussed.
[2016/01/09 13:01:18] <polyphagia> have a list of points at the top, and then just have the relevant quotes. then have the whole thing elsewhere
[2016/01/09 13:01:20] <polyphagia> oh yeah
[2016/01/09 13:01:23] <Karkus> The raw text needs to be saved, possibly for quoting.
[2016/01/09 13:01:42] <polyphagia> Tobbi: you could try posting on /r/gamedev :P
[2016/01/09 13:01:57] <Karkus> mt: Did you log it?
[2016/01/09 13:01:59] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Might make sense...I don't have a reddit account though.
[2016/01/09 13:02:00] <Hume2> So we have discussed all, didn't we?
[2016/01/09 13:02:02] <Tobbi> Plus, reddit is evil.
[2016/01/09 13:02:07] <polyphagia> why is reddit evil?
[2016/01/09 13:02:07] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yes, end of meeting.
[2016/01/09 13:02:12] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Because.
[2016/01/09 13:02:13] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/01/09 13:02:14] <polyphagia> oh ok
[2016/01/09 13:02:16] <Karkus> Hume2: Mostly, but the meeting is over anyhow.
[2016/01/09 13:02:21] <polyphagia> i thought you had a moral objection to it or something Tobbi
[2016/01/09 13:02:22] <Tobbi> Hume2: I am tired... so tired.
[2016/01/09 13:02:41] <polyphagia> anyway yeah that might work
[2016/01/09 13:02:49] <Tobbi> polyphagia: There used to be a lot of questionable content on there, unless I am mistaken.
[2016/01/09 13:02:54] <Tobbi> Maybe I am mixing it up.
[2016/01/09 13:03:06] <polyphagia> once github issues are made for everything needing to be done
[2016/01/09 13:03:08] <Tobbi> Something about putting little babies in a dishwasher.
[2016/01/09 13:03:12] <polyphagia> it can be posted as a TODO list for any eager indie devs
[2016/01/09 13:03:14] <polyphagia> lol
[2016/01/09 13:03:15] <Tobbi> Oh, wait, no. That's what I invented :D
[2016/01/09 13:03:22] <polyphagia> there's also bountysource which might work
[2016/01/09 13:03:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: s/I/We/
[2016/01/09 13:03:42] <polyphagia> :D
[2016/01/09 13:03:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: Right, Indeed. We were highly creative that day.
[2016/01/09 13:04:08] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/09 13:04:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Didn't we discuss kidnapping developers in the same conversation?
[2016/01/09 13:04:21] <Tobbi> Karkus: I really can't remember. Would need to check the logs.
[2016/01/09 13:04:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: Did you log this discussion?
[2016/01/09 13:04:51] <Tobbi> Karkus: It should be on my disk...
[2016/01/09 13:04:56] <Tobbi> I think.
[2016/01/09 13:05:10] <Karkus> Can you make a wiki page?
[2016/01/09 13:05:10] <Tobbi> If not, many other people logged it.
[2016/01/09 13:05:24] <Karkus> Someone post the log somewhere!
[2016/01/09 13:05:37] <polyphagia> i'll do it if you tell me where
[2016/01/09 13:05:38] <Tobbi> I'll try to get something to eat.
[2016/01/09 13:05:40] <Tobbi> Something proper...
[2016/01/09 13:05:54] <polyphagia> it should fit on paste.debian
[2016/01/09 13:06:10] <Karkus> Yeah, put it there for now, I will look through it.

[2016/01/09 13:12:31] <Hume2> Karkus: I've noted that the burning animations will stay as is.
[2016/01/09 13:12:43] <Karkus> Hume2: Which isn't what we agreed upon.
[2016/01/09 13:12:48] <Karkus> Let me check the log.
[2016/01/09 13:13:57] <Karkus> Hume2: I'm pretty sure we said it should be a particle effect.
[2016/01/09 13:15:28] <Hume2> Karkus: It was just mentioned, but not agreed.

[2016/01/09 13:16:10] <mt> hm
[2016/01/09 13:16:15] <mt> on the other hand
[2016/01/09 13:16:30] <mt> what if we make people use the repo with pull requests for changing the wiki contents
[2016/01/09 13:16:35] <pentagon> [10addons] 07tobbi commented on issue 09#13: SuperTux 0.3.5a fails to parse repository file index-0_4_0.nfo 13http://git.io/vu5Vp
[2016/01/09 13:16:41] <mt> and push exactly the same repo to the github-wiki repo
[2016/01/09 13:17:05] <mt> that makes it easy to edit
[2016/01/09 13:17:10] <Karkus> mt: It wouldn't matter, we could do that anyway if Hugo uses markdown.
[2016/01/09 13:17:16] <mt> and we won't have to bother with setting up hugo
[2016/01/09 13:17:20] <mt> the thing with hugo is
[2016/01/09 13:17:26] <mt> we have to generate the content
[2016/01/09 13:17:33] <mt> that can't be done from github's UI
[2016/01/09 13:17:47] <Karkus> mt: Hmm.
[2016/01/09 13:17:50] <Hume2> Karkus, I found it: [17:46] <@Karkus> Hume2: It needs to be a particle effect: next.
[2016/01/09 13:17:56] <mt> there'd be jekyll, which github autogenerates actually
[2016/01/09 13:18:03] <mt> but that doesn't work right now on Arch
[2016/01/09 13:18:09] <Karkus> Hume2: What would you like?
[2016/01/09 13:18:12] <mt> someone broke the package
[2016/01/09 13:18:36] <Hume2> Karkus: We haven't even done a vote for it.
[2016/01/09 13:19:29] <Karkus> Hume2: Make a decision.
[2016/01/09 13:19:32] <maths22> I can do a log soon if someone else hasn't
[2016/01/09 13:19:33] <Karkus> It's easier.
[2016/01/09 13:19:41] <Hume2> Karkus: Actually you killed it by the "next" thing.
[2016/01/09 13:19:46] <Karkus> maths22: polyphagia has done it.
[2016/01/09 13:20:04] <Karkus> Hume2: We had to get round to the wiki, I knew that would take ages, sorry.
[2016/01/09 13:20:15] <Hume2> Let's compare our notes.
[2016/01/09 13:20:30] <head8debian> Ok, where are we? Im a little late...
[2016/01/09 13:20:34] <Hume2> I wrote my stuff at: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/292
[2016/01/09 13:20:36] * head8debian cringes...
[2016/01/09 13:20:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: We are done.
[2016/01/09 13:20:58] <head8debian> Tobbi: That was a *long* talk.
[2016/01/09 13:21:01] <Tobbi> 3 hours of discussion.
[2016/01/09 13:21:03] <Tobbi> indeed.
[2016/01/09 13:21:27] <mt> so, what about the wiki repo as write-mirror for gollum?
[2016/01/09 13:24:08] <head8debian> maths22: Did you have a new windows store download link, or did you make it public?
[2016/01/09 13:24:23] <Karkus> mt: I think that's okay.
[2016/01/09 13:24:26] <mt> head8debian: it's the same one
[2016/01/09 13:24:35] <mt> (I guess)
[2016/01/09 13:26:16] <Hume2> I think that we could have more signals like #.
[2016/01/09 13:27:52] <mt> Tobbi: can't push to supertux/wiki
[2016/01/09 13:27:59] <Tobbi> mt: Okay, let me check.
[2016/01/09 13:28:07] <mt> you need to add it to the allowed repos
[2016/01/09 13:28:35] <mt> also, are you okay with making it a write-mirror of gollum (github wiki) for the time being?
[2016/01/09 13:28:46] <Tobbi> mt: now?
[2016/01/09 13:28:54] <Tobbi> mt: Yes.
[2016/01/09 13:29:28] <mt> So, I have pushed the current content of https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux.wiki.git to it
[2016/01/09 13:29:42] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/01/09 13:29:55] <mt> for managing PRs, it's useful to be able to push to that, you can simply add https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux.wiki.git as another remote :)
[2016/01/09 13:30:32] <mt> pentagon: github announce add #supertux SuperTux wiki
[2016/01/09 13:30:33] <pentagon> mt: The operation succeeded.
[2016/01/09 13:30:46] <mt> Tobbi: you can add it for the announcements as well
[2016/01/09 13:30:51] <Tobbi> ok

[2016/01/09 14:39:15] <mt> Karkus: I labeled that invalid
[2016/01/09 14:39:26] <Karkus> mt: I closed it
[2016/01/09 14:39:32] <mt> yes
[2016/01/09 14:39:40] <mt> but you should know there's an 'invalid' label
[2016/01/09 14:39:51] <mt> since you mentioned it wasn't valid there
[2016/01/09 14:40:06] <Karkus> mt: Well, it's still valid, just not relevant :D
[2016/01/09 14:40:19] <Karkus> mt: Effectively a wontfix
[2016/01/09 14:40:27] <Karkus> But, it's old.

[2016/01/09 14:45:37] <mt> even before 0.4.1
[2016/01/09 14:46:18] <Karkus> mt: Yes.
[2016/01/09 14:47:35] <Karkus> mt: I think I will focus on Flexlay for now, though.
[2016/01/09 14:47:49] <Tobbi> Sounds good.
[2016/01/09 14:47:54] <Tobbi> Flexlay is top prio.
[2016/01/09 14:48:08] <mt> 0.4.1 is also top prio
[2016/01/09 14:48:28] <Tobbi> right.
[2016/01/09 14:48:31] <Tobbi> :)
[2016/01/09 14:49:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: Should I update this page? http://supertuxproject.org/authors.html
[2016/01/09 14:49:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: yes, please.
[2016/01/09 14:49:23] <mt> Karkus: go ahead and remove it in its entirety
[2016/01/09 14:49:46] <mt> it doesn't serve any purpose and is hard to keep up to date
[2016/01/09 14:49:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's a good point.
[2016/01/09 14:50:07] <Tobbi> Oh, yes
[2016/01/09 14:50:10] <Tobbi> Remove would be better.
[2016/01/09 14:50:17] <Tobbi> We have authors in the game itself.
[2016/01/09 14:50:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay.
[2016/01/09 14:51:09] <Karkus> I will update the screenshots page, too
[2016/01/09 14:51:21] <Tobbi> Sounds good.
[2016/01/09 14:52:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Damn, we didn't discuss the whole supertux3 thing.

[2016/01/09 14:53:07] <Karkus> grumbel: Here's a problem. Now SuperTux M2 is release, we are technically on M3. Should we change the executable name to supertux3 and the datadir name too?
[2016/01/09 14:53:41] <Karkus> s/is release/has been released/
[2016/01/09 14:53:41] <red_bot> Karkus meant: "grumbel: Here's a problem. Now SuperTux M2 has been released, we are technically on M3. Should we change the executable name to supertux3 and the datadir name too?"
[2016/01/09 14:53:43] <grumbel> Karkus: depends on how much stuff you want to break
[2016/01/09 14:54:14] <Karkus> grumbel: Who's idea was it to change the name to supertux2?
[2016/01/09 14:54:23] <head8debian> maths22: Ok, i will try to test it sometime.
[2016/01/09 14:54:46] <grumbel> M1 is a completely different game then M2, very large parts of the engine got rewritten and such
[2016/01/09 14:55:21] <Karkus> grumbel: So, it's fine to leave it until the datadirs become incompatible?

[2016/01/09 14:55:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, there's our answer
[2016/01/09 14:56:04] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/01/09 14:56:30] <Tobbi> Karkus: We also didn't discuss a potential UI overhaul.
[2016/01/09 14:56:50] <maths22> Tobbi: What potential UI overhaul?
[2016/01/09 14:56:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's almost certainly 0.6.0 at a minimum
[2016/01/09 14:57:00] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/01/09 14:57:01] <Tobbi> :)
[2016/01/09 14:57:12] <Tobbi> maths22: I think someone suggested an overhaul of the add-on manager at least.
[2016/01/09 14:57:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: That was you. I suggested we take a different approach entirely
[2016/01/09 14:57:39] <Tobbi> Right :D
[2016/01/09 14:57:40] <Tobbi> hah
[2016/01/09 14:57:46] <maths22> Karkus, Tobbi: Can you elaborate?
[2016/01/09 14:57:48] <Karkus> As in, a rewrite. But that takes forever so, nah.
[2016/01/09 14:58:04] <Tobbi> maths22: I was thinking stk's add-on screen looks so much better than ours.
[2016/01/09 14:58:05] <Karkus> maths22: Not really. Just make it betterer.
[2016/01/09 14:58:22] <Tobbi> And I wanted to have like glassy boxes...for background.
[2016/01/09 14:58:24] <Tobbi> stuff like that.
[2016/01/09 14:58:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: And scroll bars...
[2016/01/09 14:58:39] <maths22> I have some ideas for the addon manager too... we should discuss some other time
[2016/01/09 14:58:39] <Tobbi> oh yes
[2016/01/09 14:58:44] <Karkus> The list goes on and on.
[2016/01/09 14:59:00] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/09 14:59:38] <grumbel> thumbnails would be good, I don't really care about much else, I definitely don't want scrollbars
[2016/01/09 15:00:16] <maths22> grumbel: Then we really should have pagination instead
[2016/01/09 15:02:08] <grumbel> I don't think there are enough addons for that yet
[2016/01/09 15:02:15] <Karkus> grumbel: Why not scroll bars?
[2016/01/09 15:02:16] <grumbel> Splitting levels from mods would however be a good idea
[2016/01/09 15:02:39] <maths22> grumbel: What "mods" do we have?
[2016/01/09 15:03:09] <grumbel> maths22: I don't think we have any mods yet, but we treat every addon as if it is a mod
[2016/01/09 15:03:24] <grumbel> i.e. there is no need to 'enable' a level pack
[2016/01/09 15:03:37] <maths22> grumbel: True
[2016/01/09 15:03:37] <grumbel> but there is a need to 'enable/disable' a mod that might break stuff
[2016/01/09 15:03:50] <mt> there was this reTux mod thing
[2016/01/09 15:03:51] <maths22> in my opinion, this looks pretty bad: http://snag.gy/6K4BO.jpg
[2016/01/09 15:04:05] <Karkus> grumbel: How could mods be implemented? Do you mean resource packs?
[2016/01/09 15:05:12] <grumbel> Karkus: each .zip gets already mounted into the physfs tree, so each addon can override core game graphics when it wants to
[2016/01/09 15:05:49] <Karkus> grumbel: Oh! Would that include tilesets etc.?

[2016/01/09 15:08:21] <Tobbi> mt: It works...just not on travis, for some reason.
[2016/01/09 15:08:28] <Tobbi> It works on my machine just fine.
[2016/01/09 15:08:40] <mt> aren't you using OS X?
[2016/01/09 15:08:44] <Tobbi> mt: I am.
[2016/01/09 15:08:45] <mt> might be the reason

[2016/01/09 15:09:48] <grumbel> Karkus: yes, that's already possible, but it's ugly to do that by overriding core files

[2016/01/09 15:11:01] <grumbel> Karkus: there was, but I removed it as it wasn't used by anything

[2016/01/09 15:12:51] <Tobbi> okay, I will change my previous assumption: My code works on OS X and Windows, so that's all OSes we care about :P
[2016/01/09 15:13:23] <Tobbi> Actually everything *.supertuxproject.org gives that file listing.

[2016/01/09 20:18:49] <Tobbi> Honestly, don't get grumpy like me...
[2016/01/09 20:19:03] <Tobbi> I feel OCDish about this project, which is not very nice.

[2016/01/09 20:19:22] <polyphagia> :P
[2016/01/09 20:19:45] <polyphagia> well if it means anything, whatever you guys have been doing recently has paid off
[2016/01/09 20:19:57] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Everyone says that. Let's just say I am the most active dev.
[2016/01/09 20:20:33] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Problem is: Some other contributors think that I have a higher standing. I don't. My opinions count as much as everyone else's opinion on the team.
[2016/01/09 20:21:02] <Tobbi> And I'd like to get the team away from asking me on major decisions or rating me higher...Because I really don't have a say. This is open source.
[2016/01/09 20:21:12] <polyphagia> i guess people assume project leader = BDFL
[2016/01/09 20:21:23] <Tobbi> Sometimes I am opposed to certain changes and that can hinder the project's progress.
[2016/01/09 20:21:44] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Yeah, it isn't like that for this project.
[2016/01/09 20:22:50] <polyphagia> yeah i like the way it works now
[2016/01/09 20:23:12] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I'm actually glad about every single member in this project. It's less likely the project will seize to exist in the future, this way.
[2016/01/09 20:23:23] <Tobbi> *of this project
[2016/01/09 20:23:44] <Tobbi> Plus, more contributions plus innovations...
[2016/01/09 20:23:46] <polyphagia> yup i was always kinda wondering what would happen with supertux. i remember playing it when i first started experimenting with gnulinux
[2016/01/09 20:23:52] <polyphagia> i'd have hated to see it stall
[2016/01/09 20:24:04] <Tobbi> It stalled for a substantial amount of time.
[2016/01/09 20:24:12] <polyphagia> well indefinitely that is :P
[2016/01/09 20:24:14] <polyphagia> but yeah
[2016/01/09 20:24:19] <polyphagia> progress has just completely stopped
[2016/01/09 20:24:33] <polyphagia> the move to github was a fantastic idea
[2016/01/09 20:24:56] <Tobbi> Are we still getting notified about stars, by the way?
[2016/01/09 20:25:06] <Tobbi> polyphagia: It was forced by Google Code shutdown.
[2016/01/09 20:25:10] <Tobbi> But yeah, the move was great, indeed.
[2016/01/09 20:25:31] <polyphagia> a nice thing people like to see is blog posts with updates
[2016/01/09 20:25:39] <polyphagia> well it's something *i* like to see in free projects
[2016/01/09 20:25:42] <polyphagia> dolphin-emu does a great job of it
[2016/01/09 20:25:43] <Tobbi> Oh, yeah, we don't have a blog.
[2016/01/09 20:25:55] <polyphagia> dolphin-emu is probably one of the best ran free projects out there
[2016/01/09 20:25:57] <polyphagia> tbf
[2016/01/09 20:26:03] <polyphagia> they really just handle everything really well
[2016/01/09 20:26:17] <polyphagia> infastracture, website, blog postings, maintenence
[2016/01/09 20:26:31] <polyphagia> it's like a well-oiled machine :P
[2016/01/09 20:26:37] <Tobbi> It's really active.
[2016/01/09 20:27:25] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Problem is: SuperTux is an old project, so we're praised with many things one would probably do differently nowadays.
[2016/01/09 20:29:24] <polyphagia> yeah
[2016/01/09 20:29:41] <polyphagia> there're some benefits to being old i guess
[2016/01/09 20:29:48] <polyphagia> the game is packaged in a lot of distros already
[2016/01/09 20:29:53] <polyphagia> people know about it
[2016/01/09 20:31:02] <Tobbi> Yes, that's right.
[2016/01/09 20:31:12] <Tobbi> Problem is there are also those who only complain...
[2016/01/09 20:32:09] <Tobbi> At least when reading some comments on release announcements...
[2016/01/09 20:32:17] <polyphagia> oh i know don't worry about it Tobbi
[2016/01/09 20:32:37] <polyphagia> i got really pissed off when GIMP released a new website, and the top reddit comment was just "oh but does it support X yet? guess i have to keep using photoshop..."
[2016/01/09 20:32:45] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Also, yeah, problem with being the de-facto lead is that you feel responsible for the project...
[2016/01/09 20:32:58] <polyphagia> when in the last update thread about GIMP, people were just constantly complaining about how old the website looked
[2016/01/09 20:33:01] <Tobbi> And even more if people dislike or have problems with a feature that you pushed.
[2016/01/09 20:33:40] <polyphagia> but don't worry Tobbi more people appreciate it than those who complain
[2016/01/09 20:33:47] <polyphagia> the complainers are just more vocal
[2016/01/09 20:33:49] <Tobbi> I hope so.
[2016/01/09 20:34:03] <polyphagia> i've personally spent a lot of time on supertux :P
[2016/01/09 20:34:46] <Tobbi> Me too... I wonder when was the first time I created a bug report.
[2016/01/09 20:34:58] <Tobbi> Must've been 8(?) years ago?
[2016/01/09 20:35:14] <polyphagia> so why do you use a mac Tobbi ? how did you find out about supertux?
[2016/01/09 20:35:27] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I was given a mac for free during my internship...
[2016/01/09 20:35:38] <Tobbi> And re SuperTux...I think one of my friends played it and so I got interested in it.
[2016/01/09 20:35:50] <Tobbi> s/during/for
[2016/01/09 20:35:52] <Tobbi> s/during/for/
[2016/01/09 20:35:52] <red_bot> Tobbi meant: "s/for/for"
[2016/01/09 20:35:55] <Tobbi> no.
[2016/01/09 20:35:56] <Tobbi> whatever
[2016/01/09 20:36:14] <polyphagia> oh ok
[2016/01/09 20:36:38] <polyphagia> i probably wouldn't use os x lol
[2016/01/09 20:36:39] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I was an intern at Mozilla in 2011...and people are sick of hearing about it.
[2016/01/09 20:36:45] <polyphagia> oh wow
[2016/01/09 20:36:48] <polyphagia> why?
[2016/01/09 20:36:48] <Tobbi> At least here in this channel :D
[2016/01/09 20:36:51] <polyphagia> oh
[2016/01/09 20:36:53] <polyphagia> haha
[2016/01/09 20:37:03] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Because I tend to get overexcited...even though the culture shock was quite present.
[2016/01/09 20:37:49] <polyphagia> what was culture shocking about the US?
[2016/01/09 20:38:09] <Tobbi> polyphagia: The indirectness (compared to northern Germany) and the sugar-coating...
[2016/01/09 20:38:12] <Tobbi> It was so annoying.
[2016/01/09 20:38:41] <Tobbi> By sugar-coating I mean: compliments and this disgusting "How are you?" everywhere.
[2016/01/09 20:38:57] <polyphagia> lol you should see how many euphemisms we have
[2016/01/09 20:39:01] <polyphagia> i *hate* euphemisms
[2016/01/09 20:39:09] <Tobbi> I was not used to reading in-between the lines...as a northern German...we are damn direct...
[2016/01/09 20:39:15] <Tobbi> As I mentioned yesterday, I think.
[2016/01/09 20:39:22] <polyphagia> george carlin has a good bit on euphemisms
[2016/01/09 20:39:23] <polyphagia> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuEQixrBKCc
[2016/01/09 20:39:29] <polyphagia> but yeah i wish we were more like that here Tobbi
[2016/01/09 20:39:39] <polyphagia> >In the age when torture has become "enhanced interrogation techniques"; when the rich are "job creators"; when murdered children are "collateral damage"; it is good to remember these brilliant words from the late, great, George Carlin.
[2016/01/09 20:39:51] <polyphagia> :P
[2016/01/09 20:40:10] <Tobbi> polyphagia: But we Germans don't have a "How are you?" unless you're really interested in how someone's doing.
[2016/01/09 20:40:16] <polyphagia> just a hello Tobbi ?
[2016/01/09 20:40:22] <polyphagia> or a firm nod of the head
[2016/01/09 20:40:34] <Tobbi> In America, I often answered truthfully.
[2016/01/09 20:40:38] <polyphagia> haha
[2016/01/09 20:40:42] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Depends. If you don't know the person, you ignore it...
[2016/01/09 20:40:51] <Tobbi> Or quickly greet back.
[2016/01/09 20:40:55] <polyphagia> it reminds me how americans were shocked in the UK because instead of "how are you?" they say "you alright?"
[2016/01/09 20:40:57] <Tobbi> In Northern Germany with a "Moin".
[2016/01/09 20:41:01] <polyphagia> as if there's something troubling you
[2016/01/09 20:41:07] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/09 20:41:51] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Furthermore, I couldn't get on one page with my mentor...He answered his typical "You're doing fine" when asked how I was doing.
[2016/01/09 20:42:05] <Tobbi> Annoying. Because I requested truthful information on how to improve.
[2016/01/09 20:42:10] <Tobbi> But, no, too direct.
[2016/01/09 20:42:25] <Tobbi> But might've been my fault. I should've prepared for that.
[2016/01/09 20:43:36] <polyphagia> yeah you have to learn politically-correct-speak
[2016/01/09 20:43:39] <polyphagia> i guess
[2016/01/09 20:44:11] <polyphagia> don't ask any question that could result in any answer that has the possibility of hurting your feelings
[2016/01/09 20:44:14] <polyphagia> :P
[2016/01/09 20:44:31] <Tobbi> polyphagia: And that's exactly the difference. We Germans have trouble with that.
[2016/01/09 20:44:37] <Tobbi> We are direct as can be...and are fine that way.
[2016/01/09 20:44:41] <polyphagia> it's easier just to fire you and replace you than to have a real dialect
[2016/01/09 20:45:00] <polyphagia> there's too much beuracracy and ticket systems in today's world
[2016/01/09 20:45:08] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2016/01/09 20:45:30] <Tobbi> I was glad to be home again...where I could read people properly.
[2016/01/09 20:45:38] <Tobbi> As in: Understand what they're like.
[2016/01/09 20:45:52] <polyphagia> my friend who visited germany says she misses the doners most
[2016/01/09 20:45:59] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/09 20:46:02] <Tobbi> DÃ¶ner...
[2016/01/09 20:46:08] <Tobbi> That's a Turkish food.
[2016/01/09 20:46:17] <Tobbi> Not actual German...
[2016/01/09 20:46:22] <Tobbi> But I had that yesterday as well.
[2016/01/09 20:47:03] <polyphagia> well yeah but there just aren't doners here
[2016/01/09 20:47:05] <polyphagia> it sucks
[2016/01/09 20:47:15] <polyphagia> hamburgers weren't american but now they're associated with america :P
[2016/01/09 20:47:23] <Tobbi> polyphagia: It's the healthiest fast food you can get, DÃ¶ner.
[2016/01/09 20:47:24] <polyphagia> i guess my country still has poutines
[2016/01/09 20:47:30] <polyphagia> no no
[2016/01/09 20:47:33] <polyphagia> poutines are much healthier
[2016/01/09 20:47:33] <Tobbi> No?
[2016/01/09 20:47:40] <polyphagia> ;)
[2016/01/09 20:47:58] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Poutine = french fries.
[2016/01/09 20:48:03] <Tobbi> With...disgusting sauce.
[2016/01/09 20:48:13] <polyphagia> WOAH
[2016/01/09 20:48:17] <polyphagia> how dare you!
[2016/01/09 20:48:19] <polyphagia> gravy is not disgusting
[2016/01/09 20:48:27] <Tobbi> I have never tried it.
[2016/01/09 20:48:29] <polyphagia> wait Tobbi can you really order beer at mcdonalds in germany?
[2016/01/09 20:48:31] <Tobbi> I don't intend to.
[2016/01/09 20:48:38] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I never tried that either.
[2016/01/09 20:48:38] <polyphagia> well if you come to canada you have to
[2016/01/09 20:48:42] <polyphagia> it's cheese curds, gravy and fries
[2016/01/09 20:48:44] <polyphagia> :P
[2016/01/09 20:48:49] <polyphagia> gravy?
[2016/01/09 20:48:52] <polyphagia> you've never had gravy?
[2016/01/09 20:49:06] <polyphagia> what do you put on mashed potatoes?
[2016/01/09 20:50:35] * Tobbi checks what that actually is.
[2016/01/09 20:50:58] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Okay, I might have had it. Still I go to the canteen of my college every day.
[2016/01/09 20:51:00] <Tobbi> almost
[2016/01/09 20:51:06] <Tobbi> And have what's available there.
[2016/01/09 20:52:00] <polyphagia> are you in uni or college Tobbi ?
[2016/01/09 20:52:14] <polyphagia> what are you taking?
[2016/01/09 20:52:20] <Tobbi> polyphagia: What's the difference for you?
[2016/01/09 20:52:24] <polyphagia> college is trade school
[2016/01/09 20:52:29] <polyphagia> uni is academia generally
[2016/01/09 20:53:17] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2016/01/09 20:53:33] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I'm in uni then.
[2016/01/09 20:54:22] <polyphagia> computer science Tobbi ?
[2016/01/09 20:54:38] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Yes, though I am thinking about transitioning to something else.
[2016/01/09 20:54:46] <polyphagia> aren't you 26?
[2016/01/09 20:54:49] <Tobbi> I'm in a masters course.
[2016/01/09 20:54:51] <polyphagia> oh
[2016/01/09 20:54:52] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Who cares.
[2016/01/09 20:54:54] <polyphagia> why would you transfer?
[2016/01/09 20:54:57] <Tobbi> I never really cared about money...
[2016/01/09 20:55:04] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Because I feel this is not the right thing for me.
[2016/01/09 20:55:18] <polyphagia> what would you rather take?
[2016/01/09 20:55:28] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I don't know yet.
[2016/01/09 20:55:31] <polyphagia> ic
[2016/01/09 20:55:32] <Tobbi> But I will figure it out.
[2016/01/09 20:56:03] <polyphagia> that's good
[2016/01/09 20:56:48] <Tobbi> I have to.
[2016/01/09 20:56:52] <Tobbi> And then stick to it.
[2016/01/09 20:57:49] <polyphagia> yeah for me there's really nothing else i could even dream of doing lol
[2016/01/09 20:58:02] <polyphagia> i just lived my life on the computer and that's all i can do
[2016/01/09 20:58:22] <polyphagia> i hate hands-on things
[2016/01/09 20:58:23] <Tobbi> I can do so many things. I am just afraid of taking the wrong choices.
[2016/01/09 20:58:34] <Tobbi> And that's what's hindering me.
[2016/01/09 20:58:42] <polyphagia> yeah it's a pretty big choice
[2016/01/09 20:58:54] <Tobbi> Originally I wanted to get as far as possible...
[2016/01/09 20:58:58] <Tobbi> But now...
[2016/01/09 20:59:12] <polyphagia> far as possible with what?
[2016/01/09 20:59:30] <Tobbi> polyphagia: As far as possible in terms of academic degree... of having success etc.
[2016/01/09 20:59:52] <polyphagia> oh
[2016/01/09 21:00:10] <polyphagia> yeah i felt that at one point, before i started failing lol
[2016/01/09 21:00:18] <Tobbi> I do not...
[2016/01/09 21:00:23] <Tobbi> I don't fail.
[2016/01/09 21:00:29] <polyphagia> well that's good
[2016/01/09 21:00:32] <Tobbi> As I said, I made it to Mozilla.. :D
[2016/01/09 21:00:39] <polyphagia> yeah that is very impressive
[2016/01/09 21:00:43] <polyphagia> i could never do that
[2016/01/09 21:00:52] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Okay, I contributed for yeears before that.
[2016/01/09 21:00:58] <Tobbi> So don't tell me you couldn't do it.
[2016/01/09 21:01:03] <Tobbi> You can.

[2016/01/09 21:01:48] <Tobbi> polyphagia: In this case I worked hard...and they pushed me by being nice. And by having a sense of community...friends.
[2016/01/09 21:01:52] <Tobbi> well "friends"
[2016/01/09 21:02:06] <Tobbi> Appreciation can be a good tool to achieve something.
[2016/01/09 21:02:20] <polyphagia> yeah
[2016/01/09 21:02:50] <polyphagia> it's a great motivator
[2016/01/09 21:03:07] <Tobbi> polyphagia: On the other hand: I was really surprised when Google headhunters sent me an e-mail some months ago...
[2016/01/09 21:03:18] <Tobbi> So apparently, even Google was, at one point, interested in me.
[2016/01/09 21:03:25] <Tobbi> Makes me somewhat proud.
[2016/01/09 21:03:50] <polyphagia> you should be!
[2016/01/09 21:04:32] <Tobbi> polyphagia: However, it makes it harder to really clear my mind...I know why I did this computing stuff in the first place...and it was to shield myself from life...
[2016/01/09 21:04:50] <polyphagia> from what?
[2016/01/09 21:05:10] <Tobbi> polyphagia: My life is, and has been, pretty stressful up to this point.
[2016/01/09 21:07:02] <polyphagia> oh :(
[2016/01/09 21:07:09] <jesusalva> Tobbi: Do marketing in order to destroy what remained from your life. :P
[2016/01/09 21:07:18] * jesusalva appreciates some stress, but not too much.
[2016/01/09 21:07:27] <Tobbi> jesusalva: It depends on the kind of stress...
[2016/01/09 21:07:35] <Tobbi> You really don't want to have the stress I had.
[2016/01/09 21:07:50] <Tobbi> polyphagia: If I could choose again, I wouldn't dare start a career in computer science.
[2016/01/09 21:08:18] <jesusalva> Tobbi: I know. My stress is like, "The company is about to break apart and I'm the head chief. Oh well."
[2016/01/09 21:08:39] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/01/09 21:08:39] <jesusalva> Thankfully I'm not working yet.
[2016/01/09 21:08:56] <Tobbi> jesusalva: I will need to think about my life...
[2016/01/09 21:08:59] <Tobbi> And I intend to.

[2016/01/10 12:21:23] <pil> i installed the latest version of supertux and it says 0.3.4.  I thought that the new version was 4.0?
[2016/01/10 12:21:32] <mt> how did you install it?
[2016/01/10 12:21:56] <pil> i used the .deb package
[2016/01/10 12:22:06] <mt> which deb package?
[2016/01/10 12:22:30] <pil> supertux2_0.4.0_amd64.deb
[2016/01/10 12:22:41] <mt> from?
[2016/01/10 12:23:06] <pil> http://download.supertuxproject.org/download/
[2016/01/10 12:23:28] <pil> it says development version on it too
[2016/01/10 12:23:31] <mt> what does `supertux2 -v` say?
[2016/01/10 12:23:46] <mt> and where does it say 0.3.4?
[2016/01/10 12:24:29] <pil> at the top of the window, and at the bottom by where the copyright is at.
[2016/01/10 12:24:50] <mt> I'm not sure why anything would have packaged 0.3.4
[2016/01/10 12:25:10] <mt> let me check the package
[2016/01/10 12:25:11] <pil> that says 0.3.4 too
[2016/01/10 12:25:55] <pil> supertux2 -v says "0.3.4" also
[2016/01/10 12:26:24] <mt> pil: do you happen to have installed your distros packaged build?
[2016/01/10 12:26:33] <mt> from their repositories?
[2016/01/10 12:26:54] <mt> because with the binary extracted from the .deb archive:
[2016/01/10 12:26:56] <mt> $ strings supertux2 | ag '0.4.0'

[2016/01/10 12:27:15] <pil> i tried that from one of the links from here and it says i have the most current version
[2016/01/10 12:27:47] <mt> pil: you might have installed your distributions package as well, or some other conflicting supertux binary
[2016/01/10 12:28:00] <mt> which is listed before the official one in your path
[2016/01/10 12:28:13] <mt> what does `/usr/local/games/supertux2 -v` in your terminal say

[2016/01/10 13:44:00] <pil> sorry that linux isnt my first language
[2016/01/10 13:45:12] <polyphagia> you can download the .deb from debian's website maybe?
[2016/01/10 13:45:19] <polyphagia> not sure how old the distro you're using is
[2016/01/10 13:45:21] <polyphagia> might be incompatable
[2016/01/10 13:45:35] <mt> it's ubuntu 14.04
[2016/01/10 13:45:46] <mt> and don't suggest using incompatible Linux distros
[2016/01/10 13:45:51] <polyphagia> you're amd 64?
[2016/01/10 13:45:56] <polyphagia> debian packages are compatable with ubuntu
[2016/01/10 13:45:57] <pil> yes
[2016/01/10 13:45:58] <polyphagia> but not vice versa
[2016/01/10 13:46:05] <polyphagia> https://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/supertux/download
[2016/01/10 13:46:07] <polyphagia> here pil
[2016/01/10 13:46:14] <mt> polyphagia: no they shouldn't always be
[2016/01/10 13:46:21] <polyphagia> this is what the debian manual states mt
[2016/01/10 13:46:38] <pil> i'm running mint
[2016/01/10 13:46:41] <mt> if ubuntu links to /lib/libabc1.so and debian links to /lib/libabc2.so it will break
[2016/01/10 13:46:58] <pil> which is based of ubuntu
[2016/01/10 13:46:59] <mt> mint is binary compatible with ubuntu
[2016/01/10 13:47:03] <polyphagia> might be too old pil but you can try it
[2016/01/10 13:47:09] <polyphagia> actually
[2016/01/10 13:47:11] <mt> at least 17.3 with 14.04
[2016/01/10 13:47:13] <polyphagia> 2014 is probably too old
[2016/01/10 13:47:47] <polyphagia> i don't think it's backported yet
[2016/01/10 13:47:55] <pil> i'm running 17.3
[2016/01/10 13:47:56] <polyphagia> oh it is
[2016/01/10 13:47:58] <polyphagia> https://packages.debian.org/jessie-backports/supertux
[2016/01/10 13:48:07] <polyphagia> this version might work
[2016/01/10 13:48:22] <polyphagia> i'd just recommend switching to debian though maybe :)
[2016/01/10 13:48:41] <mt> I'd just recommend not using any LTS for a home desktop
[2016/01/10 13:48:43] <mt> or laptop

[2016/01/10 13:49:46] <mt> LTS/stable distros are for corporate environments where changes in how something works are unwanted

[2016/01/10 17:21:44] <Tobbi> But I will modify history and force-push master.
[2016/01/10 17:22:22] <leper`> Tobbi: you could at least try to be more evil and change some random commit some years ago

[2016/01/10 17:23:43] <Tobbi> This is gonna take some time.

[2016/01/10 19:34:19] <Tobbi> jesusalva: Since we enabled -Werror again, everything goes crazy

[2016/01/10 19:43:05] <jesusalva> I don't even know who would make every warning an error. As fluzz said, some warnings are important, others are... just things which could be done on a better way.

[2016/01/10 19:49:18] <jesusalva> I think you should only enable "-Werror" when you're about to release as warnings aren't nice to include on final work pieces.
[2016/01/10 19:50:19] <Tobbi> For some reason, starting SuperTux is blazingly fast.

[2016/01/11 08:57:58] <maths22> Then maybe bump to 2.8, conditionally use CXX_STANDARD (if running on cmake >= 3.1), and consider increasing in the future

[2016/01/11 12:10:13] <mt> I could probably make it ignore build errors

[2016/01/11 12:17:22] <maths22> Hume2: Because I wanted to get the one with clang fixed to run, and it was going to fail on clang anyways
[2016/01/11 12:17:40] <maths22> it probably wasn't necessary, but I didn't know it would attack the channel

[2016/01/11 13:30:03] <mt> what kernel update was that?

[2016/01/11 13:33:28] <polyphag1> it's probably some probablem with the intel drivers, wouldn't be anything too surprising
[2016/01/11 13:33:38] <polyphag1> i can't complain though, the intel drivers are still miles better than the others :P
[2016/01/11 13:33:56] <mt> yeah the regressions were already fixed in 4.4 apparently

[2016/01/11 14:16:30] <Hume2> It takes an eternity to load the AppVeyor output.
[2016/01/11 14:16:34] <mt> / did you know you can use "/" as first character if you type // text here (don't know if your client supports that, however)
[2016/01/11 14:17:12] <mt> grumbel: the github-wiki. I thought we could actually host a copy of it there to accept pull requests and then also push that to the github-wiki repo
[2016/01/11 14:17:13] <Hume2> Thanks.
[2016/01/11 14:17:18] <Tobbi> /kick mt

[2016/01/11 14:17:32] <Tobbi> mt: I usually write <space>/ if I want a slash.
[2016/01/11 14:17:35] <Hume2> That error seems to be an error of Tinygettext though.
[2016/01/11 14:18:08] <mt> or some clients allow you to change the command char
[2016/01/11 14:18:33] <mt> I know someone who uses - as command char because it's where / is on a German keyboard
[2016/01/11 14:18:52] <mt> s/German/English/

[2016/01/11 14:19:01] <mt> and they use a German keyboard
[2016/01/11 14:19:26] <Tobbi> I use an English keyboard with the German layout.
[2016/01/11 14:19:33] <Tobbi> And switch to English for programming stuff...
[2016/01/11 14:19:39] <Tobbi> Oh, and I am downloading and installing Visual Studio.

[2016/01/11 14:20:53] <Tobbi> huh, a widespace / ?

[2016/01/11 14:21:17] <Hume2> Yes, it's not normal /, it's ï¼.
[2016/01/11 14:22:15] <Hume2> So that was only Tinygettext error that was there before.
[2016/01/11 14:22:51] <Hume2> At least I haven't caused any new error.
[2016/01/11 14:24:59] <maths22> Hume2: I know-I need to make it have a lot less AppVeyor output
[2016/01/11 14:25:09] <grumbel> mt: ok
[2016/01/11 14:25:21] <maths22> Does tinygettext actually use UnixFileSystem.cpp ?
[2016/01/11 14:25:31] <maths22> (Or do we use it?)
[2016/01/11 14:28:14] <Hume2> Using widespace chars is a good way how to bypass the most of chat filters.
[2016/01/11 14:28:17] <grumbel> maths22: it's used in the DirectoryManager for browsing the dirs
[2016/01/11 14:29:14] <Tobbi> alisap is at it again :D
[2016/01/11 14:29:23] <Tobbi> At translating supertux into latin :D
[2016/01/11 14:29:33] <Hume2> :D
[2016/01/11 14:29:52] <Hume2> How is "zeekling" in latin?
[2016/01/11 14:30:09] <Tobbi> Hume2: It's an arbitrary word, aka a name.
[2016/01/11 14:30:12] <grumbel> maths22: but it's not used by SuperTux, PhysFSFileSystem is used instead
[2016/01/11 14:30:14] <Tobbi> There is no translation.
[2016/01/11 14:30:17] <Tobbi> Actually, let me have a look.
[2016/01/11 14:30:34] <maths22> grumbel: What is DirectoryManager?
[2016/01/11 14:30:49] <maths22> I don't see it anywhere
[2016/01/11 14:30:51] <grumbel> maths22: the tinygettext class that manages all the .po files
[2016/01/11 14:31:03] <grumbel> DictionaryManager
[2016/01/11 14:32:22] <maths22> DictionaryManager \neq DirectoryManager - sorry
[2016/01/11 14:32:53] <maths22> Also, that is true-we use physfs
[2016/01/11 14:33:51] <maths22> I'm just thinking maybe we should remove it from the Windows builds-it doesn't add anything and causes build errors
[2016/01/11 14:34:10] <maths22> (Since it needs dirent; it actually needs removal on WinRT, since dirent.h doesnt work there at all)

[2016/01/11 14:36:49] <leper`> maths22: There is a commit in a pull request for tinygettext that adds a FS implementation for Windows
[2016/01/11 14:38:21] <Tobbi> grumbel: Those are all pages of the wiki? I would've expected there being many more.
[2016/01/11 14:38:26] <maths22> leper`: My point is that, since we don't use it (and probably won't change) we should just stop building it

[2016/01/11 15:33:48] <kneekoo> the moment I started it, it just went really slow

[2016/01/11 15:45:12] <jesusalva_> It just rotates rotates and rotates and never does anything. I read the whole GPL v2 license and the reCAPTCHA is still verifying if I'm a human. Do I need to have a good internet to answer re-captchas? :P
[2016/01/11 15:45:48] <polyphagia> i hate the new identification challenges it's offering
[2016/01/11 15:46:31] <polyphagia> also yeah i've had lots of memory leaks and CPU spinning with flash when i still used it
[2016/01/11 15:46:31] <polyphagia> jesusalva_: the ones that ask you to identify sign posts and such for some reason reject like five times before they go through
[2016/01/11 15:46:33] <polyphagia> i swear they're testing my patience at the expense to get humans to finish what their OCRs couldn't
[2016/01/11 15:47:03] <polyphagia> it was different when you were digitizing books, now you're helping Google make maps to sell
[2016/01/11 15:58:05] <jesusalva_> Now, where I left my Plasma Weapon which I used on #freedroid to vaporize MS bots? I want to vaporize Google ReCaptchas right now...
[2016/01/11 15:58:11] <Tobbi> What?
[2016/01/11 15:59:33] <jesusalva_> Tobbi: On #freedroid you need to destroy MicroSoft bots. So I got a Plasma Weapon on the game and now I want to use it to, instead of destroying MS, destroy Google (Captcha)
[2016/01/11 15:59:42] <Tobbi> ah ok
[2016/01/11 16:00:38] <polyphagia> jesusalva_: there's deathbycaptcha if you want to pay for sweatshop workers to solve them for you :P
[2016/01/11 16:01:48] <jesusalva_> Oh great. Now it says "An error occurred while contacting the reCAPTCHA service." everytime I try to submit an answer.
[2016/01/11 16:03:22] <maths22> Tobbi: I apparently can't use a cacluator
[2016/01/11 16:03:23] <jesusalva_> Do you know what? I should just give up and search for another site. It'll be faster to check every existent site with what I want than to insist on the same website and try to solve that Captcha.
[2016/01/11 16:03:50] <Tobbi> maths22: Sounds good. I often failed to use a calculator as well. Especially when it comes to looking things up in a dictionary.
[2016/01/11 16:05:28] <maths22> Tobbi: Why do you use a calculator with a dictionary?
[2016/01/11 16:05:45] <Tobbi> maths22: To find out what "Pi" is in German.
[2016/01/11 16:05:47] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/11 16:05:52] <Tobbi> And it says "Kuchen"
[2016/01/11 16:06:20] <Tobbi> eeh "Torte"
[2016/01/11 16:07:29] @ Quit: claymore2: Quit: Leaving

[2016/01/11 17:52:41] <Karkus> That didn't work.
[2016/01/11 17:52:44] <Karkus> Why not>
[2016/01/11 17:52:46] <Karkus> ?
[2016/01/11 17:53:00] <Tobbi> Karkus: Because the request has already been sent to the webhook
[2016/01/11 17:53:05] <Tobbi> It's just relaying messages.
[2016/01/11 17:53:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: And these are all the commits from the media wiki which Grumbel committed?
[2016/01/11 17:53:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: Correct! :D
[2016/01/11 17:53:56] <Tobbi> The bot is not smart enough to say "...and x other commits" instead of listing them all.
[2016/01/11 17:53:58] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/11 17:54:10] <Karkus> mt: Fix ya bot
[2016/01/11 17:54:15] <Karkus> :P
[2016/01/11 17:54:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: We calculated that it should be done relaying messages in around 30 minutes.
[2016/01/11 17:54:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: Will these still be waiting in the queue for when we next unban him though?
[2016/01/11 17:54:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: uh oh.
[2016/01/11 17:54:53] <Tobbi> I hope not.
[2016/01/11 17:54:54] <Karkus> Is the queue size decreasing?
[2016/01/11 17:55:00] <Karkus> Can we check?
[2016/01/11 17:55:05] <Tobbi> I don't think I can.

[2016/01/11 17:57:41] <Tobbi> This isn't the case.
[2016/01/11 17:58:01] <Tobbi> So we can safely assume that it's just relaying these messages silently.
[2016/01/11 17:58:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah, clever ;)
[2016/01/11 17:59:00] <Tobbi> Woo, Visual Studio is done installing.

[2016/01/11 17:59:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, I have a VM running on the side.
[2016/01/11 17:59:49] <Karkus> Ah, okay.
[2016/01/11 18:00:16] <Karkus> I want someone to test Flexlay from source on Windows
[2016/01/11 18:00:35] <Karkus> Because my computer goes crazy when I boot Windows now
[2016/01/11 18:01:02] <Tobbi> I can do so, but probably tomorrow.
[2016/01/11 18:01:07] <Tobbi> I need to finish this university assignment...
[2016/01/11 18:02:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, it's no rush anyway
[2016/01/11 18:02:54] <Karkus> I had some commits to push to Flexlay, but they... went missing
[2016/01/11 18:03:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: I forgot git rebase --skip gets rid of the patch :(
[2016/01/11 18:03:45] <Tobbi> urgh, no way to retrieve them?
[2016/01/11 18:03:56] <Tobbi> Maybe you should ask in #git
[2016/01/11 18:04:04] <Tobbi> or rather ##git
[2016/01/11 18:04:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: I have most of them. I guess I will just fix it and rebase, but I've forgotten what I lost... *sigh*
[2016/01/11 18:04:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hopefully by tomorrow
[2016/01/11 18:04:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: That happened to me. Someone (I think hume) managed to override one of my commits. And I have no idea what it was.
[2016/01/11 18:05:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: ##git just told me I needed references.
[2016/01/11 18:05:07] <Tobbi> b/c he force-pushed.
[2016/01/11 18:05:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: *sigh*
[2016/01/11 18:05:21] <Tobbi> yes, great.
[2016/01/11 18:06:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: Maybe we will spend the next few years fixing bugs that one commit had subtly fixed.
[2016/01/11 18:06:28] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/11 18:06:31] <Tobbi> This might be the case.
[2016/01/11 18:07:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Also, 10,000 commits in the mediawiki branch. Why the hell do we need that much history?
[2016/01/11 18:07:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: Don't ask me.
[2016/01/11 18:07:58] <Karkus> grumbel: Why do we need all 10,000+ commits in the mediawiki branch. That's just a waste of disk space...

[2016/01/11 18:11:20] <Tobbi> The commits are not sorted...
[2016/01/11 18:11:28] <Tobbi> HALF?
[2016/01/11 18:11:50] <Tobbi> I thought I'd calculated that it'll be done in 20 minutes.
[2016/01/11 18:11:52] <Tobbi> But okay.
[2016/01/11 18:11:56] <Tobbi> Let's unban pentagon tomorrow, then.
[2016/01/11 18:12:49] <jesusalva_> Tobbi: Just set your clock alarm so when you wake up you unban pentagon.
[2016/01/11 18:13:00] <Tobbi> jesusalva_: No, priority is not that high.
[2016/01/11 18:13:11] <Tobbi> I will regularly wake up very early at 11am.
[2016/01/11 18:13:37] <jesusalva_> Nice, because for me you're waking up about 08:00
[2016/01/11 18:13:56] <Tobbi> jesusalva_: See, proper time!
[2016/01/11 18:15:17] <Tobbi> jesusalva_: Let's hope that updating the source strings from \r\n to \n will work!
[2016/01/11 18:15:32] <Tobbi> jesusalva_: However, even if it does work, translators will get angry with me.
[2016/01/11 18:16:11] <Tobbi> because changed source strings not containing anything new.
[2016/01/11 18:16:56] <leper`> Tobbi: transifex very likely suggests the previous translation in that case (or might just keep using it)
[2016/01/11 18:17:06] <Tobbi> leper`: Hopefully.
[2016/01/11 18:17:26] <Tobbi> leper`: We're talking about literal \r\n's, anyway.
[2016/01/11 18:17:29] <grumbel> Karkus: all your commits should be available via git reflog
[2016/01/11 18:17:30] <leper`> (it did at some point, but they do like to change their interface a lot)
[2016/01/11 18:20:59] <Tobbi> leper`: It looks like they're not displaying literal \r\n anyway, so there's a high chance it'll work.
[2016/01/11 18:22:45] <grumbel> Does anybody know what github wiki does with subdirectories?

[2016/01/11 18:45:17] <maths22> Why did we give up on mediawiki anyways?
[2016/01/11 18:45:28] <maths22> It seems to be better built for the purpose
[2016/01/11 18:47:26] <grumbel> maths22: mediawiki is annoying to maintain, backup is also tricky
[2016/01/11 18:47:39] <grumbel> It's good at making pretty pages, but everything else isn't fun
[2016/01/11 18:48:31] <grumbel> but Github Wiki might indeed be a little to simplistic for a direct conversio
[2016/01/11 18:49:23] <maths22> grumbel: What do you mean about annyoing to maintain?
[2016/01/11 18:49:35] <maths22> Also, backups can be easily automated as a cron job
[2016/01/11 18:50:33] <grumbel> security updates, spam protection, user management and all that stuff
[2016/01/11 18:51:12] <grumbel> With Github wiki you don't have to worry about any of that
[2016/01/11 18:51:19] <grumbel> and since a git repository backup is automatic
[2016/01/11 18:51:19] <maths22> This is true
[2016/01/11 18:51:57] <Tobbi> Plus, the whole team can contribute.
[2016/01/11 18:52:07] <Tobbi> And doesn't have to wait for other people to create an account.
[2016/01/11 19:10:00] <Tobbi> our coverity build is still running.
[2016/01/11 19:10:06] <Tobbi> Something must've gone wrong.

[2016/01/12 11:48:11] <maths22> 1. When did you update to Windows 10?
[2016/01/12 11:48:23] <maths22> 2. Are you sure Windows update says there are no updates?
[2016/01/12 11:50:26] <maths22> Also, see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-update-faq
[2016/01/12 11:50:39] <maths22> (The latest version has a build number of 10500+

[2016/01/12 11:55:18] <maths22> grumbel: What should happen in https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/327 if the object has been destroyed?
[2016/01/12 11:55:38] <maths22> (That is, what should happen when running println(a.get_pos_x()))?
[2016/01/12 11:56:02] <grumbel> no-op or an error message
[2016/01/12 11:56:40] <head8debian> maths22: Oh, you are right. Now im finally getting another update. *facepalm*.
[2016/01/12 11:56:49] <head8debian> This is goign to take forever.
[2016/01/12 11:57:10] <maths22> head8debian: Sorry-It is essentially Windows 10 Service Pack 1
[2016/01/12 11:57:26] <maths22> But they don't call it that (and it is probably a bit less major than an old service pack)
[2016/01/12 11:57:26] <Tobbi> When was that update released?
[2016/01/12 11:57:30] <maths22> November
[2016/01/12 11:57:44] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/01/12 11:57:50] <Tobbi> I should have that in my VM then.
[2016/01/12 11:58:37] <maths22> They tell you how to check
[2016/01/12 11:58:59] <head8debian> Ah. Yes, its download version 10581...
[2016/01/12 11:59:06] * head8debian hates Windows updates...
[2016/01/12 11:59:50] <Tobbi> Maybe I should trash my VM and reinstall.
[2016/01/12 12:00:24] <Hume2> It looks like pentagon no longer says the new commits.
[2016/01/12 12:01:17] <grumbel> pentagon is saying nothing at all
[2016/01/12 12:01:43] <grumbel> I did unban it, but that hasn't helped
[2016/01/12 12:02:05] <Hume2> Someone has banned it?
[2016/01/12 12:02:33] <grumbel> Hume2: we had to ban it yesterday as it got a bit spamm'y (10'000 commits due to Wiki transfer)
[2016/01/12 12:02:55] <Hume2> Oh, I see.
[2016/01/12 12:03:09] <grumbel> Which might happen again today, as there are some more namespaces in the Wiki I haven't imported yet
[2016/01/12 12:04:01] <Hume2> It used to say only the number of commits when there was more that two, didn't it?
[2016/01/12 12:04:07] <jesusalva> Hadn't you guys changed web hooks?
[2016/01/12 12:04:23] <Tobbi> What is wrong with my VM...
[2016/01/12 12:04:33] <jesusalva> Tobbi: It's yours. :P
[2016/01/12 12:04:42] <Tobbi> jesusalva: Thanks, very eassuring.
[2016/01/12 12:04:45] * jesusalva remembers this was supposed to be a joke.
[2016/01/12 12:04:45] <Tobbi> *reassuring.
[2016/01/12 12:04:48] <Tobbi> oh, right.
[2016/01/12 12:05:46] <Hume2> Github says only 10,000+ commits, not the exact number.

[2016/01/12 12:10:28] <Hume2> I see. It went mad.
[2016/01/12 12:10:44] <mt> also, apparently it wanted to list all 13483 commits
[2016/01/12 12:11:18] <Hume2> It's strange, because it never did.
[2016/01/12 12:11:36] <Hume2> It listed only two commits.
[2016/01/12 12:11:42] <mt> notifico had a limit on 3 (or 4 commits)
[2016/01/12 12:12:11] <Hume2> You played with the limit, didn't you :)
[2016/01/12 12:12:21] <Tobbi> Hume2: I blocked it before it could list them all.
[2016/01/12 12:12:22] <maths22> grumbel: To use weak_ptr, we would need to make the other pointers smart pointers, which might be a bit involved
[2016/01/12 12:12:38] <Hume2> Tobbi: I saw it in the log.
[2016/01/12 12:12:41] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/01/12 12:12:45] <mt> Hume2: pentagon is another bot, not even based on notifico
[2016/01/12 12:12:55] <Hume2> Oh, that's it.
[2016/01/12 12:13:08] <Hume2> But still, when I rebased the editor...
[2016/01/12 12:13:18] <Hume2> It didn't list 77 commits.
[2016/01/12 12:13:23] <mt> it did
[2016/01/12 12:13:34] <grumbel> maths22: GameObjectPtr is already a std::shared_ptr
[2016/01/12 12:13:35] <Hume2> Oh really? OK
[2016/01/12 12:13:36] <mt> as far as I can see in my backlog
[2016/01/12 12:14:32] <Hume2> I see.
[2016/01/12 12:14:55] <Hume2> At least it didn't blocked the chat.
[2016/01/12 12:15:18] <maths22> grumbel: I'm blind
[2016/01/12 12:16:55] <Tobbi> Hume2: was this https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commit/05a6e624d9e63361bb6c29837ff9d63f0f66d50a#diff-486551dc90ca1275db322ea652dc7cb0L60 really duplicate?
[2016/01/12 12:17:18] <Tobbi> the if and subsequent set_action call, I mean?
[2016/01/12 12:17:34] <Hume2> Tobbi: will look at it properly.

[2016/01/12 12:20:16] <Hume2> Tobbi: It's already in I guess.
[2016/01/12 12:20:23] <Tobbi> let me check.

[2016/01/12 12:23:12] <Tobbi> Is that equivalent?
[2016/01/12 12:23:27] <Hume2> It covers that state too.
[2016/01/12 12:23:35] <Tobbi> I guess I'll just check it.
[2016/01/12 12:23:42] @ Quit: Karkus: Max SendQ exceeded
[2016/01/12 12:25:25] <Hume2> Well, it doesn't work as it worked with the STATE_FALLING.
[2016/01/12 12:25:43] <Hume2> Yes, because it does no longer active_update.
[2016/01/12 12:26:05] <Hume2> However, that doesn't mean that it should be reverted.

[2016/01/12 12:34:25] <Tobbi> And transifex, unfortunately, doesn't notice that the string didn't change.
[2016/01/12 12:34:34] <jesusalva> Tobbi: See? You were right (as always). Translators are complaining :P
[2016/01/12 12:34:42] <Hume2> That werror is my job.
[2016/01/12 12:34:51] <Tobbi> sebras: Most of the strings just have line endings changed...but please double check...if you can.
[2016/01/12 12:35:03] <Tobbi> sebras: Also, I wrote a project notification.
[2016/01/12 12:35:17] <Tobbi> I also fixed some of the issues that other users reported.
[2016/01/12 12:35:21] <sebras> jesusalva: actually I'm more complaining about transifex. If translations were done outside of that service then I could fix the tools to recognize line ending changes. ;)
[2016/01/12 12:35:40] <sebras> Tobbi: yeah, you notification was what prompted me to take a look.
[2016/01/12 12:35:42] <Tobbi> sebras: Please fetch the ones from the translation memory...
[2016/01/12 12:35:49] <Tobbi> Should be fine.
[2016/01/12 12:35:54] <sebras> Tobbi: what is translation memory?
[2016/01/12 12:36:15] <Tobbi> sebras: The thing on the right where it says: 99% match or something.
[2016/01/12 12:36:25] <Tobbi> Also, to see what I actually changed, click these links: https://github.com/SuperTux/translations/commits/master
[2016/01/12 12:36:49] <sebras> Tobbi: I cloned the gick and checked out the commit prior to using the data submodule, that seems to contain most of my original translations.
[2016/01/12 12:36:59] <Tobbi> Ah, okay...
[2016/01/12 12:37:10] <sebras> gick?! git!
[2016/01/12 12:37:13] <Tobbi> data submodule was reverted anyway...
[2016/01/12 12:37:21] <Tobbi> Wasn't thought through, properly.

[2016/01/12 12:38:19] <sebras> Tobbi: oh! under suggestions!
[2016/01/12 12:38:22] <Tobbi> grumbel: Is there a way we can reduce code duplication in constructors? For badguys we have constructors that basically do most of the same things.

[2016/01/12 12:39:35] <Hume2> That was old.

[2016/01/12 12:41:28] <jesusalva> Hume2: Now AppVeyor is also against you. ;)
[2016/01/12 12:41:44] <Tobbi> Hume2: Do we grant translators the honor to translate your worldmap stuff?
[2016/01/12 12:42:01] <grumbel> Tobbi: example? Doesn't look all that similar from what I can tell
[2016/01/12 12:42:03] <Hume2> Tobbi: No, I think.
[2016/01/12 12:42:05] <Tobbi> I mean: Your addons?
[2016/01/12 12:42:13] <Hume2> I figured it myself.
[2016/01/12 12:43:00] <Tobbi> grumbel: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/src/badguy/fish.cpp#L26 and the constructor after that are almost the same (of course). Can we offload initialization of those common members to a third constructor?
[2016/01/12 12:43:15] <mt> also, now we have the mediawiki contents in a different branch again. I thought it would be nice to have them in a separate repo for now, but well.
[2016/01/12 12:43:30] <mt> what annoys me more is that github expects .mediawiki or .wiki, but not .mw
[2016/01/12 12:43:44] <grumbel> Tobbi: ah, ok, the Reader vs native value thing. hm...
[2016/01/12 12:44:08] <mt> re mediawiki file extensions: src: https://github.com/github/markup#markups
[2016/01/12 12:44:28] <grumbel> Tobbi: proper way would be to get rid of the ReaderMapping constructor and move that into a factory function
[2016/01/12 12:44:47] <Tobbi> sebras: The good thing is that we can be fairly positive this is a one-time change. Subsequent updates to transifex will do the \r\n -> \n conversion automatically...
[2016/01/12 12:45:15] <Tobbi> sebras: This is the change I did yesterday: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/makepot.sh#L17
[2016/01/12 12:45:19] <sebras> Tobbi: alright, sounds. good. This is actually not too much of a hazzle.

[2016/01/12 12:45:53] <grumbel> C++11 also allows constructor chaining, but I am not sure that would help here

[2016/01/12 12:46:33] <Hume2> That is still that tinygettext issue I think.
[2016/01/12 12:46:33] <mt> ~note Tobbi why are you sed -i'ing the pot, instead of the actual levels?
[2016/01/12 12:46:33] <red_bot> okay, mt
[2016/01/12 12:47:33] <jesusalva> mt: Wouldn't it be to keep the old translations?
[2016/01/12 12:49:06] <mt> I, for the future, would suggest to have a pre-commit hook sed -i'ing all the *.stls to replace \r\n with \n
[2016/01/12 12:50:10] <mt> for supertux, I actually have a hook that scans the commit message for [ci skip] and requires me to write to a temporary file if it's not in there :D

[2016/01/12 13:28:00] <mt> also, this should be removed to ignore milestones
[2016/01/12 13:28:05] <mt> but rather use semver versions
[2016/01/12 13:28:31] <mt> lines should be changed to be ~80 characters long
[2016/01/12 13:28:39] <Karkus> mt: Go ahead and change it, I agree.
[2016/01/12 13:29:57] <mt> "'downer' lava tiles"
[2016/01/12 13:30:03] <mt> should this be "deeper" tiles?
[2016/01/12 13:30:33] @ bb010g joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/12 13:30:58] <Karkus> mt: Not my words...
[2016/01/12 13:32:22] <mt> yeah
[2016/01/12 13:32:26] <mt> but would you agree?
[2016/01/12 13:32:37] <mt> because "downer" is definitely wrong
[2016/01/12 13:33:29] <Karkus> mt: Where I come from, downer is a derogatory term for someone with Down's syndrome
[2016/01/12 13:33:35] <Karkus> mt: Sure.
[2016/01/12 13:34:44] <Karkus> mt: Are we going to change all the .mw files to .mediawiki?
[2016/01/12 13:37:22] <mt> When grumbel is ready
[2016/01/12 13:37:39] <mt> and then I'll look into manually copying the good parts of master to mediawiki
[2016/01/12 13:37:46] <mt> and removing the bad parts from mediawiki
[2016/01/12 13:38:02] <mt> then I'd like to rename mediawiki to master and trash the latter
[2016/01/12 13:40:51] <Karkus> mt: "manually copying the good parts of master to mediawiki" into mediawiki format?
[2016/01/12 13:41:20] <mt> no
[2016/01/12 13:41:33] <mt> I was referring to the branches
[2016/01/12 13:41:47] <mt> but github's wiki (gollum) supports mixed markup languages
[2016/01/12 13:41:47] <Karkus> master is in markdown.
[2016/01/12 13:41:54] <Karkus> mt: Do we want that?
[2016/01/12 13:42:01] <mt> master even contains some mediawiki documents
[2016/01/12 13:42:38] <Karkus> Okay.
[2016/01/12 13:42:43] <mt> yes, iirc even the wysiwyg editor supports that
[2016/01/12 13:47:19] <Karkus> mt: But we will continue to have markdown files too?
[2016/01/12 13:47:44] <mt> if people convert the old ones, or create new pages
[2016/01/12 13:47:46] <mt> yes
[2016/01/12 13:48:06] <Karkus> mt: So what's preferable?
[2016/01/12 13:48:23] <mt> Markdown, AsciiDoc or reStructuredText
[2016/01/12 13:48:45] <grumbel> I am ready to force-push some mediawiki updates, any objections?

[2016/01/12 13:49:06] <mt> no
[2016/01/12 13:49:24] <mt> I've shut down pentagon for now
[2016/01/12 13:50:25] <mt> Karkus: new version: https://github.com/SuperTux/wiki/blob/master/TODO.md
[2016/01/12 13:51:03] <mt> also, re markup languages: I guess, Markdown is the best choice for normal documents, since it's what GitHub uses anyway, and most people know how to use it
[2016/01/12 13:51:15] <mt> reStructuredText is cool because it natively supports tables
[2016/01/12 13:51:35] <mt> tables aren't possible in all markdown "dialects"
[2016/01/12 13:53:10] <Karkus> mt: Are they handled better in reStructuredText?
[2016/01/12 13:54:03] <mt> they're supported
[2016/01/12 13:54:09] <mt> in standard markdown, they're not
[2016/01/12 13:54:39] <mt> GitHub supports a Markdown that supports it, but that will look ugly with standard markdown renderers
[2016/01/12 13:57:44] <grumbel> mediawiki is now complete
[2016/01/12 14:00:00] <mt> nice
[2016/01/12 14:00:16] <mt> I wonder if git-mediawiki supports cloning wikipedia
[2016/01/12 14:07:05] <Karkus> grumbel: Can't we squash all commits before a certain date?
[2016/01/12 14:07:22] <grumbel> Karkus: no, preserving history was the whole point of this
[2016/01/12 14:07:46] <Karkus> grumbel: And why do we wish to preserve history?
[2016/01/12 14:08:02] <mt> because history is an important part of any project
[2016/01/12 14:08:08] <grumbel> Karkus: you can use 'git clone --depth 1' if you don't want it
[2016/01/12 14:08:11] <mt> and effort should be made to preserve it
[2016/01/12 14:08:53] <mt> Karkus: http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
[2016/01/12 14:12:17] <Karkus> grumbel, mt: So, can we change them to file extensions that GitHub can view?
[2016/01/12 14:12:58] <mt> I'd suggest so
[2016/01/12 14:13:08] <mt> to .mediawiki, because that's easy to recognize
[2016/01/12 14:13:22] <mt> .wiki could be, tbh, everything github is able to render

[2016/01/12 18:22:55] <maths22> (I only implmented for TextObject right now, but if my approach seems reasonable, I will carry it over to the other scriptable objects as well)
[2016/01/12 18:27:15] <grumbel> auto m_parent = ... -> auto parent = ...  the m_ is for member variables
[2016/01/12 18:28:15] <grumbel> Not sure what happens with the scripting code when an exception is thrown from within, maybe: if (auto parent = m_parent.lock()) { ... } instead
[2016/01/12 18:29:45] <maths22> grumbel: see http://2.1m.yt/nVhQuR8.png
[2016/01/12 18:29:48] <grumbel> or hiding it behind a macro
[2016/01/12 18:30:11] <maths22> I personally think throwing an error is better than silently doing nothing
[2016/01/12 18:31:32] <maths22> Ideally the wrapper would wrap it into a squirrel error, but the current behavior seems reasonable to me
[2016/01/12 18:32:20] <grumbel> as long as it doesn't break the call stack of squirrel it should be ok
[2016/01/12 18:32:31] <grumbel> might still be a good idea to hide it all away in a macro

[2016/01/12 18:33:52] <grumbel> or something along the lines
[2016/01/12 18:34:16] <maths22> I agree with the hiding in a macro
[2016/01/12 18:34:31] <maths22> Should all the script files share a header file?
[2016/01/12 18:35:09] <grumbel> I guess
[2016/01/12 18:35:36] <maths22> It just seems silly to duplicate that macro across all the files
[2016/01/12 18:37:04] <grumbel> put it into scripting/util.hpp or something like that, I don't we have any header for script stuff yet
[2016/01/12 18:37:43] <grumbel> there is scripting/squirrel_util.hpp, but that seems more related with squirrel itself, then scripting in general
[2016/01/12 18:38:24] <maths22> Sounds reasonable to me
[2016/01/12 18:39:28] <maths22> Why do we put a person's name in the copyright header at the top of the source files?
[2016/01/12 18:41:20] <maths22> Stylistically, should a macro be followed by a semicolon when it is invoked?

[2016/01/12 18:50:28] <maths22> In theory, aren't all the scripted objects vulnerable?
[2016/01/12 18:53:04] <grumbel> maths22: name at the top of the file is good to keep track about copyright when files move between projects, not so important in a single project where you have git history

[2016/01/12 18:53:57] <maths22> Makes sense
[2016/01/12 18:54:10] <grumbel> maths22: semicolon at the end of the macro, as otherwise auto-indention breaks
[2016/01/12 18:54:27] <maths22> grumbel: I thought so, but wanted to check
[2016/01/12 18:55:26] <grumbel> not sure if BEGIN_SCRIPT; or BEGIN_SCRIPT(); is better
[2016/01/12 18:56:53] <maths22> Probably with parenthesis
[2016/01/12 19:07:56] <maths22> grumbel: I have modified all the ones you updated today
[2016/01/12 19:08:33] <maths22> I assume all the other scripted objects (for example Thunderstorm) also need updating?

[2016/01/13 08:29:13] <jesusalva> Haha!
[2016/01/13 08:29:18] <jesusalva> ;)
[2016/01/13 08:29:19] <mt> especially if you just left 3 minutes before
[2016/01/13 08:30:14] <jesusalva> I know, but my IRC client doesn't know that. u_u
[2016/01/13 08:31:02] <mt> that's automated?
[2016/01/13 08:31:52] <jesusalva> It would be too boring to say 'Hello' on every channel, but I already found some implementation errors which I'm studying to fiz.
[2016/01/13 08:31:54] <jesusalva> *fix
[2016/01/13 08:32:04] <jesusalva> By example, that, which you pointed above,

[2016/01/13 08:32:07] @ Mode +o Tobbi by ChanServ
[2016/01/13 08:32:30] <jesusalva> and another minor issue which I say 'Hello' twice on a certain channel and I must fix it.
[2016/01/13 08:32:39] <mt> jesusalva: you should really disable that
[2016/01/13 08:32:49] <mt> most channels do not like that kind of automated message
[2016/01/13 08:33:03] <jesusalva> I know, but I'm not in most of channels.
[2016/01/13 08:33:36] <jesusalva> As I said, I must think in a way to don't repeat it if I was on the channel on the last 15 minutes.
[2016/01/13 08:33:48] <jesusalva> so it only covers day-by-day logins.
[2016/01/13 08:33:50] <mt> well, I don't like it

[2016/01/13 08:35:53] <mt> you can do it if you make sure it doesn't spam it (probably only once every, say, 6-12 hours)
[2016/01/13 08:36:15] <jesusalva> Yes, you're probably right
[2016/01/13 08:36:25] <jesusalva> Except I'm still learning KVS. u_u
[2016/01/13 08:36:32] <Tobbi> KVS?
[2016/01/13 08:36:42] <jesusalva> I can't even disable it on channel X, so I'm doing a little more study.
[2016/01/13 08:36:53] <jesusalva> Tobbi: KVirc Scrippting.
[2016/01/13 08:36:56] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/01/13 08:37:16] <jesusalva> Supposed to be an easier and more flexible language for IRC.
[2016/01/13 08:39:03] <mt> I don't like client-specific languages
[2016/01/13 08:39:14] <mt> they have absolutely no use for other purposes
[2016/01/13 08:40:21] <mt> WeeChat supports scripting in Python, Perl, Ruby, TCL, Guile/Scheme, Lua, JavaScript and everything else you're able to add as a plugin
[2016/01/13 08:40:51] <jesusalva> Well, KVS is compatible with Python and Perl, but I like KVS enough.
[2016/01/13 08:48:40] <Tobbi> Why does coverity suck so much currently?
[2016/01/13 08:48:59] <Tobbi> The build is still "analyzing".
[2016/01/13 08:49:09] <mt> because they don't care about their free users anymore
[2016/01/13 08:49:18] <Tobbi> mt: Is that so?
[2016/01/13 08:49:45] <mt> well, I guess so if it's still "analyzing"
[2016/01/13 08:49:58] <mt> after how many days? almost a week?
[2016/01/13 08:50:25] <Tobbi> mt: I don't know. I think I triggered a new build in the mean time.
[2016/01/13 08:51:09] <Tobbi> mt: Last commit on coverity scan was 3 days ago...
[2016/01/13 08:51:14] <Tobbi> So, yeah, after 3 days.
[2016/01/13 08:53:03] <mt> still seems way too long for it to be reliable
[2016/01/13 08:53:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: How can you dislike google when they almost offered me a job? :P
[2016/01/13 08:53:49] <jesusalva> Tobbi: I remember you being pessimistic about the odds of google contacting you. :P
[2016/01/13 08:54:01] <Tobbi> jesusalva: They did contact me 7 months ago.
[2016/01/13 08:54:13] <Tobbi> Though they didn't accept me based on my CV.
[2016/01/13 08:54:26] <Tobbi> And I'm almost glad. But now that my masters course doesn't really fulfill me...
[2016/01/13 08:54:30] <Tobbi> You know...
[2016/01/13 08:58:11] <jesusalva> Tobbi: How long to you make your 6th year anniversary on IRC? (Since you registered your account)
[2016/01/13 08:58:28] <Tobbi> jesusalva: I don't know when my account was registered.
[2016/01/13 08:58:50] <jesusalva> Tobbi: Jan 29 23:23:18 2010
[2016/01/13 08:58:56] <Tobbi> ok.
[2016/01/13 08:59:00] <jesusalva> Hey, It's really close! :)

[2016/01/13 11:52:55] <mt> btw, we could use .gitattributes to make git change \r\n to \n without user interaction
[2016/01/13 11:53:17] <Tobbi> mt: Actually, that could work.
[2016/01/13 11:53:21] <Tobbi> And seems easier...
[2016/01/13 11:53:27] <Tobbi> mt: Can you do the modifications?
[2016/01/13 11:53:52] <Tobbi> At the same time, you can remove my hack...
[2016/01/13 11:54:03] <mt> your hack?

[2016/01/13 11:54:26] <Tobbi> Github still treats supertux level files as binary.
[2016/01/13 11:54:30] <Tobbi> and tries to render them.
[2016/01/13 11:54:58] <Tobbi> because https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29
[2016/01/13 11:55:00] <mt> ask their support to add support for that
[2016/01/13 11:55:07] <Tobbi> mt: Maybe I should.
[2016/01/13 11:55:10] <mt> I know about STL

[2016/01/13 15:45:49] <polyphagia> CTCP reply from maths22_: VERSION Quassel IRC v0.12.2 (dist-9c5e6c6) (built on Jan 13 2016 15:17:26) -- http://www.quassel-irc.org
[2016/01/13 15:45:51] <polyphagia> yeah
[2016/01/13 15:46:09] <polyphagia> you must be on a bleeding edge distro or just built it yourself :P

[2016/01/13 15:46:42] <polyphagia> oh cool
[2016/01/13 15:46:46] <polyphagia> one thing i found really cool about freebsd
[2016/01/13 15:46:54] <polyphagia> in some tools, you can send ^T
[2016/01/13 15:47:18] <polyphagia> to get status information. like in dd for instance, while it's running ^T will trigger it to give you periodical status messages about how much it's copied
[2016/01/13 15:47:40] <polyphagia> this can be used in quite a bit of the core utils in freebsd, but not found in GNU at all
[2016/01/13 15:48:41] <polyphagia> yeah fedora is a cool distro too maths22_! always pushing the latest stuff well
[2016/01/13 15:48:42] <polyphagia> like wayland
[2016/01/13 15:48:44] <polyphagia> :D

[2016/01/14 11:03:06] <head8debian> jesusalva: Heyo!
[2016/01/14 11:03:41] <jesusalva> Hi
[2016/01/14 11:04:16] <jesusalva> Good afternoon head8debian
[2016/01/14 11:04:23] <jesusalva> Not so late today. Congratz ;)
[2016/01/14 11:04:28] <head8debian> jesusalva: :D
[2016/01/14 11:04:54] <head8debian> jesusalva: What are you up to?
[2016/01/14 11:05:55] <jesusalva> Well, various things. Right now I'm managing staff (I mean 80 persons or more) on OGame, and as soon I'm done, I should help to advertise the return of #tmw-br to the other ex-players and Brazilians. ;)
[2016/01/14 11:06:23] <jesusalva> Today there is no event on church. The rare day I don't leave home after 19:30. u_u
[2016/01/14 11:07:04] <head8debian> jesusalva: Wow, im almost always at home. ;)
[2016/01/14 11:07:37] <jesusalva> I spend a good deal of time in front of my PC -- err, laptop, due to laziness. '_'
[2016/01/14 11:08:24] <head8debian> jesusalva: I usually find something to do thats profitable, at least in my opinion. :p
[2016/01/14 11:09:03] <jesusalva> I have what? 499 books pending to read, from academic stuff to Christian Literature? :p
[2016/01/14 11:09:19] <head8debian> Lately ive been pushing more and more tryign to find FLOSS software.
[2016/01/14 11:09:21] <head8debian> :D
[2016/01/14 11:09:37] <jesusalva> :)
[2016/01/14 11:10:09] <head8debian> My latest find is Qupzilla, a web browser, and so far i have nothing but good to say about it.
[2016/01/14 11:10:16] <head8debian> In my case its faster than chrome.
[2016/01/14 11:10:20] <head8debian> :D

[2016/01/14 11:11:10] <jesusalva> I don't like Chrome. I use it on my cellphone because it's built-in web browser isn't any better.
[2016/01/14 11:11:28] <jesusalva> And because I have no space left to install, say, firefox for example. U_U
[2016/01/14 11:11:36] <head8debian> Eww.
[2016/01/14 11:11:41] <head8debian> Stock android install?
[2016/01/14 11:11:54] <head8debian> I hate the pre-installed apps.
[2016/01/14 11:12:10] <head8debian> Yeah... QUpzilla hasn't been ported to android sadly.

[2016/01/14 11:12:32] <jesusalva> I just don't want to mess with the warranty by sudo-ing my phone yet.
[2016/01/14 11:12:48] <head8debian> jesusalva: Ah. :) Mine is rooted and unlocked.
[2016/01/14 11:13:05] <jesusalva> :)
[2016/01/14 11:13:16] <head8debian> mt: Ouch!
[2016/01/14 11:13:22] <mt> hah, I've got a phone that apparently came rooted by default :D
[2016/01/14 11:13:28] <jesusalva> If I root it, I might break it, and it's already broken enough for my taste. :P
[2016/01/14 11:13:29] <mt> adb shell spawns a root shell
[2016/01/14 11:13:48] <Tobbi> Hello.
[2016/01/14 11:13:56] <jesusalva> Hi Tobbi
[2016/01/14 11:14:09] <Tobbi> Looks like I have a lot of scrollback to read.
[2016/01/14 11:14:14] <head8debian> jesusalva: Yes. stock install is very broken.
[2016/01/14 11:14:45] <Tobbi> Who wants to install a Stock anyway.
[2016/01/14 11:14:59] <jesusalva> Well, I must go now to buy a cake.
[2016/01/14 11:15:05] <Tobbi> Oh, wait that only works in German.
[2016/01/14 11:15:17] <Tobbi> "Wer will denn schon einen Stock installieren?"
[2016/01/14 11:15:23] <jesusalva> The only bad part is that it cannot be chocolate, so umm, let's search a bit more. u_u
[2016/01/14 11:15:59] <Tobbi> Did someone say chocolate? :D
[2016/01/14 11:16:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: Can't you buy chocolate at a German store and then have it sent to me?
[2016/01/14 11:16:16] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/14 11:16:19] <Tobbi> Should be cheap.
[2016/01/14 11:16:20] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/14 11:16:22] <head8debian> o_O
[2016/01/14 11:16:34] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/14 11:16:34] <head8debian> Man, my system is doing odd things lately.
[2016/01/14 11:16:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: better than even things, anyway.
[2016/01/14 11:16:47] <head8debian> I may have to pull out the old desktop. Oh wait, no, i cannot.
[2016/01/14 11:17:09] <head8debian> Weird...
[2016/01/14 11:17:18] <Tobbi> No, a desktop isn't weird, it's wired.
[2016/01/14 11:17:35] <head8debian> No, its weird why my system is acting weird.
[2016/01/14 11:18:09] <head8debian> Sometimes it won't shut down fully, it says my USB ports are overcurrent, windows doesn't ever show anything wrong...
[2016/01/14 11:18:17] <head8debian> Neither did debian8.
[2016/01/14 11:19:02] <head8debian> mt: Debian already pushed a security fix.
[2016/01/14 11:19:15] <head8debian> :D
[2016/01/14 11:19:25] <head8debian> I should get on updating my computers.
[2016/01/14 11:20:25] <Tobbi> Those 1024 you have.
[2016/01/14 11:21:10] <Tobbi> Just to have 2^8 of them.
[2016/01/14 11:22:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: Your humor is awfull today...
[2016/01/14 11:22:57] <Tobbi> head8debian: It can't be so aweful when you can still misspell awful.
[2016/01/14 11:23:13] <Tobbi> haha, shit, I did too.
[2016/01/14 11:23:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: ...
[2016/01/14 11:23:24] <Tobbi> *cough*, haha, *damn*, I did too.
[2016/01/14 11:23:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: Shoot is much better than shi*
[2016/01/14 11:23:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: Do you use google chrome or firefox?
[2016/01/14 11:24:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: Your wildcard also matches shin.
[2016/01/14 11:24:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: Nightlz.
[2016/01/14 11:24:08] <Tobbi> *Nightly
[2016/01/14 11:25:06] <head8debian> ?
[2016/01/14 11:25:37] <head8debian> jesusalva: Is Tobbi making any sense to you?
[2016/01/14 11:25:49] <Tobbi> head8debian: Nightly.
[2016/01/14 11:26:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: And what is that?

[2016/01/14 11:26:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: Say Firefox nightly.
[2016/01/14 11:27:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: No. That wouldn't have been as mystic.
[2016/01/14 11:35:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: I think you need to hold off on the alchohol.

[2016/01/15 12:13:36] <Tobbi> Why don't people realize that this is an OPEN SOURCE GAME with LIMITED RESOURCES... for fawkes sake...
[2016/01/15 12:21:46] <leper`> ah, a case of "the old version was better because I knew it!!!!1!!!eleven"
[2016/01/15 12:25:43] <Tobbi> leper`: I hate those guys. No appreciation of what we've done.
[2016/01/15 12:25:58] <Tobbi> Why don't people realize this is an Open Source project?
[2016/01/15 12:26:24] <Tobbi> ANd that we have time and personal constraints?
[2016/01/15 12:26:26] <Tobbi> And what not...
[2016/01/15 12:27:00] <leper`> because all they see is free game and you need to solve whatever issue they have
[2016/01/15 12:27:41] <Tobbi> hrm...
[2016/01/15 12:28:18] <leper`> you can reply with snarky comments and tell them to go submit a patch though
[2016/01/15 12:28:28] <leper`> that makes them shut up in most cases
[2016/01/15 12:30:23] <leper`> (you could also reply that you'd be willing to implement this, state your hourly rate, the minimum required time, and if they'd still be interested)
[2016/01/15 12:35:16] <Tobbi> :D

[2016/01/16 05:22:35] <mt> well yeah
[2016/01/16 05:23:00] <mt> it needs to count the commits in a push and only announce x as configured
[2016/01/16 05:23:26] <mt> there's a silly workaround for this, actually
[2016/01/16 05:23:28] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2016/01/16 05:23:40] <Tobbi> But let me work on my college assignments first.
[2016/01/16 05:24:03] <mt> if there was some database plugin I'd make the commit list call a command that counts the commits and aborts after x
[2016/01/16 05:24:19] <Tobbi> But we do have the list of commits.

[2016/01/16 11:10:10] <jesusalva> Oh. :)
[2016/01/16 11:10:24] <jesusalva> Wouldn't it be +S flag, then?

[2016/01/16 11:10:49] <Tobbi> Also, the user named "Hume" had full founder, plus administrator rights... for around 30 seconds.

[2016/01/16 11:14:26] <Tobbi> aha, VERBOSE flag? What's that do?
[2016/01/16 11:14:41] <mt> it announces SET and FLAGS changes to the channel

[2016/01/16 11:15:10] <Tobbi> Who's Charlie, she said, and smiled in her special way.

[2016/01/16 11:15:33] <Tobbi> there she goes and knows I'm dying when she says "Who is Charlie"?
[2016/01/16 11:15:37] <mt> we got the channel transfered to us by freenode
[2016/01/16 11:15:50] <Tobbi> Games with names that girl is playing, all she says is "Who is Charlie?"
[2016/01/16 11:15:56] <Tobbi> Okay, I'll stop now.
[2016/01/16 11:26:18] <Hume2> I thought a tiny feature.
[2016/01/16 11:26:43] <Hume2> The level titles could have their own colour in worldmaps.
[2016/01/16 11:27:09] <Hume2> Most of the levels qould be white anyway.
[2016/01/16 11:27:21] <Hume2> s/qould/would/
[2016/01/16 11:27:21] <red_bot> Hume2 meant: "Most of the levels would be white anyway."
[2016/01/16 11:28:02] <Hume2> The coulour could indicate its functionality.
[2016/01/16 11:28:41] <Hume2> For example normal levels white, essencial levels yellow, bonus levels blue, boss levels red...
[2016/01/16 11:29:04] <jesusalva> I can picture it.
[2016/01/16 11:29:46] <Hume2> I'll try to make a PR.

[2016/01/16 12:02:28] <Tobbi> mt: I am thinking we should really have an add-on website that allows us to generate that add-on index on the fly...
[2016/01/16 12:03:09] <Tobbi> Because executing a script is...cumbersome.
[2016/01/16 12:03:23] <Tobbi> Especially because of different line endings...

[2016/01/16 12:06:49] <polyphagia> oh yeah i noticed a lot of ^Microsofts in the levels
[2016/01/16 12:07:07] <polyphagia> the add-ons
[2016/01/16 12:07:21] <polyphagia> we should make like an imgur-esque platform where people can preview, share, comment and rate them :P

[2016/01/16 12:08:44] <mt> like, using flask oslt
[2016/01/16 12:09:41] <Tobbi> hmmm...
[2016/01/16 12:10:10] <Yaiyan> Xmoto had something like that for its levels
[2016/01/16 12:10:11] <Tobbi> Sounds good.
[2016/01/16 12:10:28] <Yaiyan> But whoever built the website left the project, so the site ended up breaking as the level format got new features
[2016/01/16 12:10:32] <Yaiyan> So that's a risk of doing something like that
[2016/01/16 12:11:12] <mt> the problem is also that we need someone who hosts that stuff
[2016/01/16 12:11:54] <mt> we can't suddenly change the repository url, especially as it's hardcoded right now (fixing that shouldn't be all too hard)
[2016/01/16 12:12:35] <Tobbi> mt: but flask sounds fun. And it should be fairly easy to setup.
[2016/01/16 12:12:55] <mt> yeah
[2016/01/16 12:12:57] <Tobbi> mt: Also, I think maths22 has a server that can run python.

[2016/01/16 12:13:45] <polyphagia> you could always just make the website sync with the git
[2016/01/16 12:13:55] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/01/16 12:13:56] <polyphagia> and then it'd be backwards compatable, while allowing you to clean everything pu
[2016/01/16 12:14:11] <polyphagia> you can just automatically send it as a commit
[2016/01/16 12:15:28] <mt> Tobbi: supertuxproject.org root is pointing to a github/fastly IP, and gets mapped to the repo using the CNAME file
[2016/01/16 12:15:33] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2016/01/16 12:15:35] <Tobbi> okay...
[2016/01/16 12:15:36] <Tobbi> bad.
[2016/01/16 12:15:43] <mt> why?
[2016/01/16 12:16:02] <mt> we can still have api.supertuxproject.org pointing to someplace else
[2016/01/16 12:16:07] <Tobbi> mt: Right.
[2016/01/16 12:17:04] <mt> I think...
[2016/01/16 12:17:18] <mt> if we clone the addons repo to a webroot
[2016/01/16 12:17:29] <mt> and then also run flask generating the nfo on that server
[2016/01/16 12:17:38] <Tobbi> mt: Couldn't we actually make travis generate the add-on index whenever something is changed? :D
[2016/01/16 12:17:40] <mt> and we proxy that through cloudflare
[2016/01/16 12:17:58] <mt> Tobbi: if you want it to trigger itself
[2016/01/16 12:18:03] <Tobbi> mt: I am not sure.
[2016/01/16 12:18:20] <mt> [new commit -> travis commits changes -> travis sees its commit -> travis commits changes -> repeat]
[2016/01/16 12:18:52] <mt> we could actually
[2016/01/16 12:19:15] <mt> but we'd for the moment have to host nfo and zips at different places
[2016/01/16 12:20:03] <Tobbi> mt: We could as well just have a special commit message tag...
[2016/01/16 12:20:06] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/16 12:20:14] <Tobbi> [gen-nfo]
[2016/01/16 12:20:16] <Tobbi> or whatever.
[2016/01/16 12:20:33] <mt> hm yeah
[2016/01/16 12:21:34] <Tobbi> mt: We should automate what we can to save us some trouble. :)

[2016/01/16 12:27:40] <mt> uh

[2016/01/16 13:06:15] <Tobbi> Don't forget that SuperTux needs to run on embedded devices as well.
[2016/01/16 13:06:17] <leyyin> *insert optimization comment here*
[2016/01/16 13:06:23] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/01/16 13:06:25] <Tobbi> okay, okay.

[2016/01/16 13:09:08] <Tobbi> leyyin: Okay...
[2016/01/16 13:09:27] <leyyin> or ask me, cuz I am a C++ guru
[2016/01/16 13:09:37] <leyyin> self proclamation is always true
[2016/01/16 13:09:58] <Tobbi> :) definitely.
[2016/01/16 13:10:19] <Tobbi> leyyin: Do you own a car...?
[2016/01/16 13:10:46] <leyyin> no
[2016/01/16 13:10:52] <leyyin> and I do not indent to

[2016/01/16 13:11:29] <leyyin> I live in Europe ;)
[2016/01/16 13:11:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: Well, for upkeep, we have the TÃV...that means your car needs to get checked every two years.
[2016/01/16 13:11:38] <Tobbi> And mine is due...now.
[2016/01/16 13:12:03] <leyyin> also, gas, etc, parts, oil, other old 20 century tech shit

[2016/01/16 13:12:46] <Tobbi> 580, to be exact.
[2016/01/16 13:13:00] <Tobbi> not sure if I am willing to do that...
[2016/01/16 13:13:10] <Tobbi> Actually, I agreed...
[2016/01/16 13:13:14] <Tobbi> So, I will do it.
[2016/01/16 13:13:43] <leyyin> lol :D
[2016/01/16 13:13:56] <leyyin> also, the petrol market seems rigged to me
[2016/01/16 13:14:11] <leyyin> petrol is at a low time low, and gas prices do not get lower, even in several months
[2016/01/16 13:14:16] <jesusalva> Here, about or over 60% of your upkeep are taxes -- after all, we have a somewhat high tax per car onwed.
[2016/01/16 13:14:20] <leyyin> when their storage supplies run out
[2016/01/16 13:14:28] <Tobbi> hmm...

[2016/01/16 13:15:30] <Tobbi> per liter.
[2016/01/16 13:15:34] <Tobbi> Super, that is.
[2016/01/16 13:15:44] <leyyin> hehe, that is like per gallon in Texas

[2016/01/17 11:05:04] <Tobbi> Or find out about ways to send chocolate my way without paying a fortune.
[2016/01/17 11:05:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: :p
[2016/01/17 11:05:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: I'd prefer the latter, actually.
[2016/01/17 11:05:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im actually trying to make up my mind on weather or not to buy a VPS and do my own cloud hosting or to pay my email provider a ( i think) one time fee for it.
[2016/01/17 11:06:01] @ alket joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/17 11:06:03] <head8debian> Both have Pros and cons...
[2016/01/17 11:06:31] <Tobbi> head8debian: What? You can pay for a VPS but don't want to spend some valuable money for your good ol' friend Tobbi who's suffering every day by being the interim project lead?
[2016/01/17 11:06:40] <Tobbi> How dare you?
[2016/01/17 11:06:41] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/17 11:06:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not 25$ to ship 2$ worth of chocolate. :p
[2016/01/17 11:07:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: Maybe you should maximize the value...Put more chocolate in.
[2016/01/17 11:07:21] <Tobbi> Or buy more expensive chocolate for those shipping costs.
[2016/01/17 11:07:29] <Tobbi> Everyone will be happier then, including me.
[2016/01/17 11:07:31] <head8debian> I cannot afford to. :p
[2016/01/17 11:07:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: If you can afford a VPS, you can afford sending me chocolate.
[2016/01/17 11:07:54] <Tobbi> And what is better value for your money, huh?
[2016/01/17 11:08:11] <Tobbi> I'd say sending me chocolate. Since that will allow you to make someone happy in the long term.
[2016/01/17 11:08:24] <Tobbi> a VPS will make you sad because it costs electricity.
[2016/01/17 11:08:33] <Tobbi> However, I will remember that act of kindness for years to come.
[2016/01/17 11:08:39] <Tobbi> Thus, long term investment: check.
[2016/01/17 11:08:55] * head8debian rolls his eyes...
[2016/01/17 11:09:07] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/17 11:09:17] * Tobbi is writing some documentation
[2016/01/17 11:09:27] <head8debian> You fix my internet first. Im pretty much locked down to IRC. :D
[2016/01/17 11:09:34] <head8debian> :p
[2016/01/17 11:10:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: I will personally come over to your place and fix that internet for you.
[2016/01/17 11:10:11] <Tobbi> That is, if you pay for travel and 5-star hotel.
[2016/01/17 11:10:17] <Tobbi> And lodging.
[2016/01/17 11:10:18] <head8debian> The only issue i have with going the VPS route is that i have no clue if they will go out of buisiness in a week... their website is pretty sketchy.
[2016/01/17 11:10:28] <Tobbi> eh, wait.
[2016/01/17 11:10:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: 5 star hotel? You sleep with a goat. :p
[2016/01/17 11:10:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: They won't allow that in a 5-star-hotel.
[2016/01/17 11:10:56] <Tobbi> Also, eww... I am not a goat-o-phile.
[2016/01/17 11:11:01] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/01/17 11:11:31] <Tobbi> Uhm, sorry, that was inappropriate.
[2016/01/17 11:11:38] <head8debian> And i don't think you would have any succes fixing ur internet anyways, youd have to get our ISP to upgrade their whole system. :D
[2016/01/17 11:11:38] <Tobbi> Back to my documentation.
[2016/01/17 11:11:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: I'm gonna yell at them.
[2016/01/17 11:11:51] <Tobbi> And that'll make them fix it.
[2016/01/17 11:12:03] <head8debian> You can yell at them from where you are currently.
[2016/01/17 11:12:24] <Tobbi> head8debian: They won't be able to hear me.
[2016/01/17 11:12:29] <mt> crowdfund your own ISP
[2016/01/17 11:12:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: But honestly Tobbi, i don't have 50$ to ship you some chocolate. :)
[2016/01/17 11:12:49] <Tobbi> mt: He can call it GoatISP.
[2016/01/17 11:13:03] <mt> +1
[2016/01/17 11:13:08] <Tobbi> mt: Be happy he's not that other guy...
[2016/01/17 11:13:15] <Tobbi> I mean *that other guy*
[2016/01/17 11:13:20] <head8debian> mt: Heh, i wish... but we cannot get the high speed internet here with wires. There are lot of high speed ISPs around here, they just want a *ton*.
[2016/01/17 11:13:36] <head8debian> well, high speed is about 10-40mbps.
[2016/01/17 11:13:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: Invent GoatIP
[2016/01/17 11:13:49] <mt> how much do they want?
[2016/01/17 11:14:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: You just have to train a goat to carry your data (CDs, portable HDDs) and send it on its way.
[2016/01/17 11:14:18] <head8debian> mt: the easiest one to get to my door is 140$/month for 12mb/s.
[2016/01/17 11:14:19] <Tobbi> And make sure it doesn't get lost.
[2016/01/17 11:14:26] <mt> head8debian: wtf
[2016/01/17 11:14:34] <mt> what ISP is that?
[2016/01/17 11:14:43] <head8debian> mt: The one that i can get down the road is 60$/month for 40mb/s.
[2016/01/17 11:14:47] <Tobbi> What? I pay 20 EUR for 25Mbit down.
[2016/01/17 11:14:52] <head8debian> But is not cabled to our door.
[2016/01/17 11:15:26] <head8debian> Yep, but if i move 10 mins away from here i can get it quite a bit cheaper. :D
[2016/01/17 11:15:38] <Tobbi> You guys are keeping me from my documentation...
[2016/01/17 11:15:40] <head8debian> a 2gb/s line for only(!!) 300$/month. :p
[2016/01/17 11:15:43] <mt> Heh, you could probably get 1 GBit/s for that money ina  bigger city
[2016/01/17 11:16:14] <head8debian> mt: Well, getting it to these rural doorsteps is a PITB.
[2016/01/17 11:16:25] <head8debian> Oh, and i can get 4G here.
[2016/01/17 11:16:31] <Tobbi> I can get 100 MBit/s for... 40 EUR...?
[2016/01/17 11:16:33] * head8debian has a tower down the road.
[2016/01/17 11:16:42] <Tobbi> *could*
[2016/01/17 11:17:01] <Tobbi> mt: I was with Deutsche Telekom before, and they tricked me into buying their Entertainment package...
[2016/01/17 11:17:07] <Tobbi> 50 EUR per month.
[2016/01/17 11:17:21] <head8debian> The easiest one is the 140$ month package, and it would be the most reliable.
[2016/01/17 11:17:39] <Tobbi> I was kind of asking for a downgrade to a cheaper package...and they tricked me.
[2016/01/17 11:17:49] <head8debian> Tobbi: Heh.
[2016/01/17 11:18:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: But Kabel Deutschland is the cheapest you can get here.
[2016/01/17 11:18:36] <head8debian> mt: So, what do you think would be the best option, for me to buy some cloud storage from my email provider for 2$ a GB, or to buy a VPS for 15$/y for 50gb.
[2016/01/17 11:18:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: By the way: We have SeagullIP
[2016/01/17 11:18:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: Lovely.
[2016/01/17 11:18:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: Seagulls poop everywhere.
[2016/01/17 11:19:10] <mt> I'm with Deutsche Telekom, there's no Kabel *-ISP here
[2016/01/17 11:19:18] <Tobbi> mt: How much do you pay?
[2016/01/17 11:19:55] <head8debian> Im also confused if my email provider wants pay every year, since he says he does, but the  'how much time till you have to pay' has not changed...
[2016/01/17 11:20:49] <mt> Tobbi: 34,95 â¬ for 16 MBit/s LTE + 16 MBit/s DSL (DSL is actually only 0.5 KBit/s here); no data cap
[2016/01/17 11:20:53] <mt> per month
[2016/01/17 11:21:15] <Tobbi> mt: That's actually "okayish"...
[2016/01/17 11:21:18] <mt> VoIP is also included
[2016/01/17 11:21:34] <Tobbi> I do have telephone as well here.
[2016/01/17 11:21:49] <Tobbi> mt: Actually, mobile internet is something I don't have...soo...
[2016/01/17 11:22:10] <mt> well, the LTE is for my home as well
[2016/01/17 11:22:19] <mt> because there's only slow DSL
[2016/01/17 11:22:36] <Tobbi> mt: My father got around 60 Mbit / s and uses it for e-mail and browsing the internet.
[2016/01/17 11:22:52] <head8debian> VOIP would suffer badly on this conection...
[2016/01/17 11:23:09] <head8debian> Maybe i should just buy some more cloud space from my email provider.... well...
[2016/01/17 11:23:18] <head8debian> Hmm.
[2016/01/17 11:23:30] <Tobbi> head8debian: What's wrong with dropbox?
[2016/01/17 11:23:35] <Tobbi> Or Microsoft thigny.
[2016/01/17 11:23:37] <mt> they say there's going to be faster DSL
[2016/01/17 11:23:41] <mt> in 2 weeks
[2016/01/17 11:23:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't trust them. :p
[2016/01/17 11:24:02] <Tobbi> mt: So, probably VDSL...
[2016/01/17 11:24:08] <head8debian> But then again, do i trust my openmailbox.org, or a VPS host?
[2016/01/17 11:24:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Whom do you trust?
[2016/01/17 11:24:25] <Tobbi> How do you define trust?
[2016/01/17 11:24:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Nobody. :p
[2016/01/17 11:24:32] <Tobbi> How do you dolphin trust?
[2016/01/17 11:24:37] <Tobbi> How do you trust dolphins?
[2016/01/17 11:24:46] <Tobbi> How do dolphins trust you?
[2016/01/17 11:24:47] <head8debian> Yes, i do trust the filemanager called dolphin.
[2016/01/17 11:24:51] <Tobbi> Is a dolphin even an animal?
[2016/01/17 11:25:07] * head8debian should just buy a VPS and a super-cheap domain...
[2016/01/17 11:25:26] <head8debian> Then i can customize it all i want.
[2016/01/17 11:25:26] <Tobbi> head8debian.ilovepinkishkittens.tk
[2016/01/17 11:26:12] <mt> there's a user with is.the.best.pony as vHost on freenode :D
[2016/01/17 11:26:21] <mt> usually freenode staff doesn't do custom vHosts
[2016/01/17 11:26:26] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/17 11:26:36] <mt> but they apparently thought it was funny to do that once
[2016/01/17 11:26:42] <Tobbi> Well, alright.
[2016/01/17 11:27:57] <Tobbi> head8debian: cf is also free of charge.
[2016/01/17 11:28:06] <Tobbi> -> tobbi.cf redirects to tobbi.bplaced.net
[2016/01/17 11:28:08] <head8debian> cf?
[2016/01/17 11:28:18] <head8debian> .cf*?
[2016/01/17 11:28:48] <Tobbi> yes.

[2016/01/17 11:30:24] <head8debian> As i said, you can get them quite cheap. :D
[2016/01/17 11:31:02] <mt> 'can I buy the "." domain plz? for, say, 10$/y?'
[2016/01/17 11:31:21] <head8debian> :p
[2016/01/17 11:31:41] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/17 11:32:28] <mt> I wish IANA/ICANN was more open about the root zone
[2016/01/17 11:33:45] <mt> also about new root-servers
[2016/01/17 11:33:56] <mt> sure you need a reliable infrastructure
[2016/01/17 11:34:17] <mt> but it's still missing a bit transparency
[2016/01/17 11:34:47] <mt> and we're not anymore in a time where a DNS reply was that limited by size
[2016/01/17 11:37:31] <Tobbi> I registered tobbi.cf a year ago...
[2016/01/17 11:37:35] <Tobbi> Time passed quickly.
[2016/01/17 11:39:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: Free for a year is not free.
[2016/01/17 11:39:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: I renewed it...
[2016/01/17 11:39:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: I can renew it indefinitely.
[2016/01/17 11:39:36] <mt> freename is a bunch of idiots tho
[2016/01/17 11:39:49] <mt> they can take away your domain for anything they'd like to
[2016/01/17 11:39:56] <head8debian> mt: I figured.
[2016/01/17 11:39:58] <mt> since they own it legally
[2016/01/17 11:40:15] <head8debian> mt: Where do you recomend buying domains from?
[2016/01/17 11:40:20] <head8debian> *real* domains. ;)
[2016/01/17 11:40:33] <Tobbi> mt: They can take away tobbi.cf if they want.
[2016/01/17 11:40:34] <Tobbi> I don't care.
[2016/01/17 11:40:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, i care about this more than that. :p
[2016/01/17 11:40:55] <mt> head8debian: https://www.namecheap.com/ https://www.gandi.net/ https://www.inwx.de/
[2016/01/17 11:41:30] <head8debian> I can register a .info for 1$ a year?!
[2016/01/17 11:41:37] <head8debian> mt: Ok.
[2016/01/17 11:41:50] <mt> also, if you want some exotic ccTLDs
[2016/01/17 11:41:57] <mt> try registering with a local registrar
[2016/01/17 11:43:12] <mt> e.g. inwx.de wants 34.9 EUR/year for .si, domene.si wants 12.9 EUR/year
[2016/01/17 11:43:32] <head8debian> Any .sydney? :p

[2016/01/17 12:46:48] <Tobbi> Hume2: Microsoft participates / participated in Wine a little bit.
[2016/01/17 12:49:06] <Hume2> Tobbi: I saw some Microsoft Github repositories.
[2016/01/17 12:49:21] <Tobbi> Hume2: I know. I don't think it's strange.
[2016/01/17 12:51:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ugg, im starting to hate paypal. I opened an account with them and ive been banned twice for unknown reasons.
[2016/01/17 12:52:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: It says in their AGB that they don't trade with goats.
[2016/01/17 12:52:33] <head8debian> Thanks for calling me a goat.
[2016/01/17 12:52:34] <mt> US people don't know what an AGB is
[2016/01/17 12:52:55] <mt> it's the German abbreviation for ToS
[2016/01/17 12:53:25] <head8debian> Ah.
[2016/01/17 12:53:31] <head8debian> I figured.
[2016/01/17 12:53:56] <head8debian> But really, ive lost 20$ so far over this, its rediculous... now i have to wait on support again.
[2016/01/17 12:54:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: I meant using goats as a payment.
[2016/01/17 12:54:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: And thats why you are not gettign chocolate, paypal is taking it out of my hands and away from you.
[2016/01/17 12:54:24] <Tobbi> I wasn't calling you a goat.
[2016/01/17 12:54:30] <head8debian> :p
[2016/01/17 12:54:39] <Tobbi> mt: Ah, yes...
[2016/01/17 12:54:40] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/17 12:54:54] <Tobbi> mt: That happens when you think about something else.
[2016/01/17 12:57:41] <kneekoo> but why did they ban you?
[2016/01/17 12:58:03] <kneekoo> I have an old account that I used to send and receive money and... no problems at all
[2016/01/17 12:58:28] <head8debian> kneekoo: My mom has an old account as well that is fine.
[2016/01/17 12:58:48] <head8debian> kneekoo: They said they saw some suspicious activity on a day that nobody logged in.
[2016/01/17 12:59:28] <kneekoo> try using a nasty password
[2016/01/17 12:59:53] <kneekoo> not as in "PayPalSucksBallz" but "oi376*&^GB&*&bg()"
[2016/01/17 12:59:56] <head8debian> kneekoo: I used a password generator and made it as long as paypal could support.
[2016/01/17 13:00:05] <kneekoo> I see
[2016/01/17 13:00:07] <head8debian> Which is suprisingly small.
[2016/01/17 13:00:11] <kneekoo> then they are drunk
[2016/01/17 13:00:12] <head8debian> Like 30 characters.
[2016/01/17 13:01:03] <kneekoo> those are enough
[2016/01/17 13:01:35] <kneekoo> I don't think PayPal doesn't have brute-force protection
[2016/01/17 13:02:04] <mt> >as long as paypal could support
[2016/01/17 13:02:07] <head8debian> Fun fun...
[2016/01/17 13:02:08] <mt> >30 characters
[2016/01/17 13:02:23] <mt> really? maximum limits on passwords?
[2016/01/17 13:03:04] <kneekoo> yeah, some dumb-asses still have the mindset of saving clear-text passwords in the DB
[2016/01/17 13:03:19] <kneekoo> so they limit to whatever they consider long enough
[2016/01/17 13:03:42] <kneekoo> I want to login with my SuperTuz .tar.gz!
[2016/01/17 13:03:52] <kneekoo> it still boils down to a hash, right? :))
[2016/01/17 13:03:58] <kneekoo> SuperTux
[2016/01/17 13:04:05] <mt> or, whatever they consider as safe enough that people can't flood their DBs
[2016/01/17 13:04:37] <kneekoo> the hashes have limited length anyway
[2016/01/17 13:04:56] * Hume2 hates all those password restrictions.
[2016/01/17 13:05:14] <kneekoo> so a password length restriction is borderline stupid these days
[2016/01/17 13:05:44] <kneekoo> the web pages weigh MB in size and they restrict us to 30 character-long password :))
[2016/01/17 13:05:59] <kneekoo> there's absolute no logical reason for that
[2016/01/17 13:06:04] <Hume2> :D
[2016/01/17 13:06:40] <Hume2> Storing the password in literal state is unsafe though.
[2016/01/17 13:06:59] <kneekoo> so how do we login on supertuxproject.org? :D can I choose a 128-long password?
[2016/01/17 13:07:20] <Tobbi> I don't even remember the password to our twitter account.
[2016/01/17 13:07:36] <Hume2> Tell me, who does.
[2016/01/17 13:08:09] <head8debian> I do. :D
[2016/01/17 13:08:17] <Hume2> :D
[2016/01/17 13:08:22] <kneekoo> quick, e-mail all
[2016/01/17 13:08:35] <head8debian> When we need to login, i will .:p
[2016/01/17 13:09:23] <kneekoo> some updates would be really cool, at least once (screenshot of the) a month :)
[2016/01/17 13:11:07] <kneekoo> this is it, right? https://twitter.com/supertux_team
[2016/01/17 13:11:08] <head8debian> True, but i dont have one to post atm. lol.
[2016/01/17 13:11:11] <head8debian> Yes.
[2016/01/17 13:11:57] <mt> btw
[2016/01/17 13:12:00] <mt> in the mentions
[2016/01/17 13:12:08] <mt> there's something about SuperTux on XMir
[2016/01/17 13:13:54] <kneekoo> can we play SuperTux on the RaspberryPi?
[2016/01/17 13:14:18] <mt> you can, I think
[2016/01/17 13:14:21] <kneekoo> :))
[2016/01/17 13:14:49] <kneekoo> I won't sit on my Raspberry Pi while playing SuperTux on my PC, that's for sure
[2016/01/17 13:15:08] <kneekoo> I never looked if there's a build for the Pi
[2016/01/17 13:15:24] * kneekoo goes to check
[2016/01/17 13:16:36] <mt> you can also build it yourself
[2016/01/17 13:17:13] <head8debian> We will do a twitter post in a couple days, it hasn't been a month since the release. :p
[2016/01/17 13:17:27] <kneekoo> it looks like it's been built and advertised in a book https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/raspberry-pi-gaming/9781784399337/ch06s02.html

[2016/01/17 14:53:50] <head8debian> Well, i dont think it will become unaccessible in 10 years.
[2016/01/17 14:53:56] <kneekoo> it will survive in the repositories

[2016/01/17 15:09:17] <kneekoo> no, I thought you were
[2016/01/17 15:09:55] <kneekoo> I don't even know what to say about a quad-core on SSD RAID for terminal emulators and web browsing
[2016/01/17 15:10:13] <jeezy> kneekoo: no i was being serious
[2016/01/17 15:10:36] <jeezy> i have other computers or high res demands

[2016/01/17 15:11:30] <kneekoo> yeah, no problem
[2016/01/17 15:11:39] <kneekoo> I'm still in shock :))
[2016/01/17 15:11:43] <jeezy> :)
[2016/01/17 15:13:06] <Tobbi> Where is shock...
[2016/01/17 15:13:12] <Tobbi> I'd like to travel there.
[2016/01/17 15:13:17] <jeezy> lol
[2016/01/17 15:13:39] <Tobbi> oh, here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock,_West_Virginia
[2016/01/17 15:13:56] <jeezy> ahh
[2016/01/17 15:17:21] <kneekoo> so do I have to install libsdl2-dev to compile 0.4.0?
[2016/01/17 15:18:13] <kneekoo> (I'm trying to compile 0.4.0 on RasPi)
[2016/01/17 15:19:24] <Tobbi> kneekoo: I think so. Can't you simply install build-dep supertux?
[2016/01/17 15:19:55] <kneekoo> I'm a power-user, not a power-compiler :P
[2016/01/17 15:20:02] <kneekoo> so I have no idea :)
[2016/01/17 15:21:05] <kneekoo> I installed cmake, which went easy, then libsdl2-dev wants 71 more packages and I asked because I don't want to burden my mSD card if I don't have to
[2016/01/17 15:21:47] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2016/01/17 15:21:47] <kneekoo> I just wanted to make sure it's that specific package
[2016/01/17 15:22:04] <Tobbi> kneekoo: sudo apt-get build-dep supertux?
[2016/01/17 15:22:32] <kneekoo> from the source?
[2016/01/17 15:23:09] <kneekoo> I downloaded the source, unpacked it, created a "build" directory, entered inside and ran "cmake .." as instructed
[2016/01/17 15:23:29] <kneekoo> I never played with build-dep so I don't know how to use it or what to expect :)
[2016/01/17 15:23:40] <Tobbi> kneekoo: build-dep installs build-dependencies..
[2016/01/17 15:24:44] <kneekoo> ok, but how does apt know the build dependencies if 0.1.3 is in the repository?
[2016/01/17 15:25:32] <Tobbi> oh.
[2016/01/17 15:25:35] <Tobbi> kneekoo: Is it?
[2016/01/17 15:26:00] <kneekoo> yes, I installed it earlier and played the first level :P
[2016/01/17 15:26:29] <kneekoo> but I want to give 0.4.0 a try on my Pi
[2016/01/17 15:28:10] <kneekoo> oh well, I'll try it my way and see how it goes
[2016/01/17 15:28:18] <kneekoo> wish me luck! :)
[2016/01/17 15:28:31] <Jesusaves> Good luck!
[2016/01/17 15:28:37] * Jesusaves hides
[2016/01/17 15:28:41] <kneekoo> :))
[2016/01/17 15:29:15] <kneekoo> my poor RasPi...
[2016/01/17 15:29:35] <kneekoo> installing 72 packages for one compiler dependency
[2016/01/17 15:30:03] <kneekoo> cmake only wanted cmake-data along
[2016/01/17 15:30:41] <kneekoo> I'll see what the others want :) and hopefully everything's in the Raspbian repository
[2016/01/17 15:31:12] <kneekoo> because compiling compiler dependencies is such a pain...

[2016/01/17 15:39:48] <Tobbi> I use XBMC as well.
[2016/01/17 15:39:54] <Tobbi> I even contributed a couple of patches to it.
[2016/01/17 15:40:25] <Tobbi> Problem is that it's hooked up to my old school TV via Composite.
[2016/01/17 15:41:16] <kneekoo> why is that a problem?
[2016/01/17 15:41:54] <Tobbi> kneekoo: Quality is not too great.
[2016/01/17 15:42:09] <Tobbi> Also, I cannot control it with my remote.
[2016/01/17 15:42:13] <Tobbi> But need to use my smartphone.
[2016/01/17 15:42:18] <kneekoo> oh, I see
[2016/01/17 15:42:21] <Tobbi> HDMI is a great technology.
[2016/01/17 15:42:34] <kneekoo> I only connect it through HDMI
[2016/01/17 15:43:31] <kneekoo> I have a mSD with OpenELEC 16 and I jsut switch the Raspbian with it and play stuff
[2016/01/17 15:43:39] <kneekoo> no, OpenELEC 6

[2016/01/17 15:48:24] <kneekoo> which libcurl package should I install?
[2016/01/17 15:48:39] <kneekoo> I have versions 3 and 4 but no -dev package
[2016/01/17 15:50:30] <kneekoo> actually, there are four -dev packages but I don't know if they are the right ones: libcurl4-gnutls-dev, libcurl4-openssl-dev, libcurl-ocaml-dev and libcurlpp-dev
[2016/01/17 15:50:44] <kneekoo> I'm tempted to install libcurlpp-dev
[2016/01/17 15:51:47] <kneekoo> I don't know why there isn't a libcurl-dev package, like all the others have one -dev without extra stuff
[2016/01/17 15:53:48] <kneekoo> nope, libcurlpp-dev wasn't the one

[2016/01/18 13:04:51] <mt> for some reason I have the strange feeling that github banned my server from using their URL shortener because pentagon wanted it to shorten 13xyz URLs

[2016/01/19 08:26:35] <Tobbi> mt: That short closing timespan is due to that guy and others filing bogus bug reports.
[2016/01/19 08:26:45] <Tobbi> Or remember those translation stuff by savsish?
[2016/01/19 08:26:51] <mt> Yeah
[2016/01/19 08:27:13] <Tobbi> See...
[2016/01/19 08:27:18] <Tobbi> mt: I'd say that's nothing to be proud of.
[2016/01/19 08:27:35] <mt> btw, do we need the auto op in the channel?
[2016/01/19 08:27:36] <mt> https://freenode.net/channel_guidelines.shtml
[2016/01/19 08:27:53] <mt> "Use channel operator privileges sparingly. Each time you use them you raise the channel temperature. Users will be pleased with you, angry at you, frustrated that you used them inappropriately, envious that you have control over the discussion. None of these reactions may be conscious on the part of other users, but all of them increase the channel temperature."
[2016/01/19 08:28:18] <Tobbi> mt: I don't know... I really don't want to worry about that, either.
[2016/01/19 08:28:22] <Tobbi> I got other stuff to think about right now.
[2016/01/19 08:28:33] <Tobbi> Like an oral exam.

[2016/01/19 12:02:38] <Hume2> Hello, Karkus :)
[2016/01/19 12:03:54] <Tobbi> Hello guys.
[2016/01/19 12:04:51] <Tobbi> the windows ci build started failing for whatever reason after https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commit/70914a6bf6481a3063a36194779a775e945e6b89
[2016/01/19 12:04:57] <Tobbi> If anyone is willing to investigate, go ahead.
[2016/01/19 12:05:40] @ leyyin joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/19 12:06:00] <Hume2> hmmm...
[2016/01/19 12:07:42] <Hume2> I thought that AppVeyor is failing.
[2016/01/19 12:10:07] <Hume2> Well, AppVeyor is ci too, I guess. When I hear ci, I automatically think that it's Travis CI.
[2016/01/19 12:10:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Any error message to look at?
[2016/01/19 12:10:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: One moment.
[2016/01/19 12:11:54] <Tobbi> this is gonna take some time.
[2016/01/19 12:11:59] <Tobbi> Stupid log.
[2016/01/19 12:13:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: http://pastebin.com/i8a2q6X9
[2016/01/19 12:15:02] <Hume2> It looks like I got the same thing too when I tried to investigate it.
[2016/01/19 12:15:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Can you build?
[2016/01/19 12:15:29] <Karkus> Last time I tried I couldn't, but I thought it was something else.
[2016/01/19 12:15:48] <Hume2> I can build on my machine.
[2016/01/19 12:17:51] <Karkus> Hume2: Okay, it's probably me. Let me try again, one moment
[2016/01/19 12:18:54] <Hume2> Karkus: Are you trying Windows or Linux?
[2016/01/19 12:20:15] <Karkus> Hume2: Linux. It's probably irrelevant, ik.
[2016/01/19 12:20:58] <Hume2> I hoped that it's only Windows issue :P
[2016/01/19 12:21:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: I haven't tried building on Windows in a long time.
[2016/01/19 12:22:47] <leyyin> heresy Tobbi!!!
[2016/01/19 12:23:10] <Tobbi> leyyin: What?

[2016/01/19 12:24:07] <Tobbi> leyyin: I know what it is, but why?
[2016/01/19 12:24:23] <leyyin> how can you not build on windows
[2016/01/19 12:24:51] <Tobbi> leyyin: Do you?
[2016/01/19 12:25:01] * leyyin hides
[2016/01/19 12:25:17] <Tobbi> leyyin: See!
[2016/01/19 12:25:22] <Tobbi> Now, stop it.
[2016/01/19 12:25:42] <Tobbi> leyyin: I am busy pretending to be learning...
[2016/01/19 12:25:50] <leyyin> on IRC
[2016/01/19 12:25:53] <leyyin> gotcha ;)
[2016/01/19 12:26:13] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yeah...We have an oral exam about test automation tomorrow.
[2016/01/19 12:29:59] <Hume2> I got that there is a way how to make a private repository on GitHub without paying any money.
[2016/01/19 12:30:32] <Hume2> Well, it's not much private, but closed-source.
[2016/01/19 12:31:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: I think you should troll the person owning the @supertux account on Twitter and trick him into deleting his account.
[2016/01/19 12:32:17] <leyyin> hehe
[2016/01/19 12:32:23] <leyyin> is that a challenge?
[2016/01/19 12:32:29] <Hume2> I don't watch Twitter. Is there a troll that pretrnds to be supertux or it's we?
[2016/01/19 12:33:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes.
[2016/01/19 12:34:06] <Tobbi> Hume2: It's not a troll. He registered the account pretty early I guess.
[2016/01/19 12:34:23] <Hume2> Thanks, Tobbi.
[2016/01/19 12:34:48] <leyyin> too bad I do not got any time
[2016/01/19 12:34:49] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yeah, August 2008...
[2016/01/19 12:34:56] <Tobbi> leyyin: What are you doing?
[2016/01/19 12:35:05] <leyyin> learning
[2016/01/19 12:35:21] <Hume2> Are you learning at least something useful?
[2016/01/19 12:35:44] <leyyin> how to conquer the world? idk, seems pretty useful to me
[2016/01/19 12:35:53] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, you're chatting on #stk how football is not an imperial system.
[2016/01/19 12:35:59] <Hume2> hmmm...
[2016/01/19 12:37:27] <Hume2> When I learn school stuff, I learn only the useless things.
[2016/01/19 12:37:58] <Hume2> It's because I already know the useful stuff and I want to pass maturita somehow.
[2016/01/19 12:38:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: I don't learn anything and still pass.
[2016/01/19 12:38:14] <Tobbi> See, there you go.
[2016/01/19 12:38:52] <leyyin> Highschool....
[2016/01/19 12:39:02] <Tobbi> leyyin: Same goes for college, most of the time.
[2016/01/19 12:39:07] <leyyin> depends
[2016/01/19 12:39:10] <Tobbi> I don't feel like I've learned a lot...
[2016/01/19 12:39:29] <Tobbi> leyyin: Also, I sometimes really feel like I have no idea about computers...I sometimes feel like an impostor.
[2016/01/19 12:39:29] <leyyin> just think what would you know now if there was no school
[2016/01/19 12:39:35] <Hume2> I fell like I've learned a lot of useless stuff.
[2016/01/19 12:40:11] <Tobbi> leyyin: My Bachelor thesis proof-reader told me that my thesis was easier to understand than a fellow student one's.
[2016/01/19 12:40:21] <Tobbi> leyyin: Thus, that means it's basic and bad :P
[2016/01/19 12:40:26] <Tobbi> aka, not technical :D
[2016/01/19 12:40:29] <leyyin> wtf?
[2016/01/19 12:40:43] <leyyin> is he an idiot
[2016/01/19 12:40:51] <leyyin> easy to underastand = bad ?
[2016/01/19 12:40:57] <Hume2> It means that it's about useless facts, I guess.
[2016/01/19 12:40:58] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, that's what I interpret.
[2016/01/19 12:40:59] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/19 12:41:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: I think she meant it as a compliment.
[2016/01/19 12:41:30] <leyyin> oh boy, I assumed that it is a man
[2016/01/19 12:41:38] <leyyin> social justice warriors will go after me now
[2016/01/19 12:41:40] <Tobbi> leyyin: She studied maths in college.
[2016/01/19 12:42:01] <Tobbi> And does maths tutoring.
[2016/01/19 12:42:04] <Tobbi> :)
[2016/01/19 12:42:16] <Hume2> I started to hate the maths tests as well, you know, too easy.
[2016/01/19 12:42:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: But, anyway... I think I am bad at anything too technical. What I did in my thesis was really easy stuff.
[2016/01/19 12:43:08] <Tobbi> But if you were to tell me about business logic...I'm just not interested in that.
[2016/01/19 12:43:14] <Tobbi> also, ttyl.
[2016/01/19 12:43:21] <Hume2> When i have to construct something, it takes a really long time.
[2016/01/19 12:43:46] <Tobbi> got to go do some sports.

[2016/01/19 12:44:49] <Hume2> You know, I get stuch easily because I don't have <stuff>.
[2016/01/19 12:45:51] <Hume2> leyyin: Sports at night, any idea what could it be?
[2016/01/19 12:53:32] <leyyin> playing sports with lights?
[2016/01/19 12:57:31] <Hume2> Sounds like a disco...
[2016/01/19 12:59:16] <leyyin> just playing the same sport with a nocturn...
[2016/01/19 13:00:29] <Hume2> It must be a well lit playground I guess.

[2016/01/19 16:09:47] <Tobbi> leyyin: I do Karate.
[2016/01/19 16:09:55] <Tobbi> just so you know.
[2016/01/19 16:11:13] <leyyin> oh man, you dance? :D
[2016/01/19 16:12:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: What?
[2016/01/19 16:12:58] <Tobbi> Karate isn't dancing.
[2016/01/19 16:13:05] <leyyin> pff, it is :P
[2016/01/19 16:13:22] <Tobbi> leyyin: Do you know Karate?
[2016/01/19 16:13:27] <Tobbi> How do you know it's dancing?
[2016/01/19 16:13:56] <leyyin> cuz it's like dancing
[2016/01/19 16:14:07] <Tobbi> leyyin: It depends.
[2016/01/19 16:14:15] <Tobbi> You normally don't knock people unconscious in dancing.
[2016/01/19 16:14:19] <Tobbi> Unless you're a really terrible dancer.
[2016/01/19 16:14:41] <leyyin> karate does not work btw
[2016/01/19 16:14:46] <leyyin> you will get your ass kicked with karate
[2016/01/19 16:14:55] <Tobbi> leyyin: That's why we do street fighting as well...
[2016/01/19 16:15:00] <Tobbi> Aka, we learn how to use it.
[2016/01/19 16:15:05] <Tobbi> That's more advanced as well.
[2016/01/19 16:15:22] <jesusalva> karate.exe: Bug overflow. Core dumped.
[2016/01/19 16:15:46] <Tobbi> leyyin: Have you ever tried to do Karate=
[2016/01/19 16:15:47] <Tobbi> _
[2016/01/19 16:15:52] <Tobbi> damn this keyboard...
[2016/01/19 16:15:53] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/01/19 16:15:57] <leyyin> yes
[2016/01/19 16:16:02] <leyyin> it's dancing
[2016/01/19 16:16:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: How far did you get?
[2016/01/19 16:16:12] <leyyin> not far
[2016/01/19 16:16:19] <Tobbi> leyyin: Did you do any kata?
[2016/01/19 16:16:21] <leyyin> but it's like yoga with screaming
[2016/01/19 16:16:33] <Tobbi> Also, what style did you do?
[2016/01/19 16:16:39] <leyyin> idk idk
[2016/01/19 16:16:42] <Tobbi> Goyu ryu, shotokan...
[2016/01/19 16:16:43] <leyyin> idk what  kata is
[2016/01/19 16:16:44] <Tobbi> wadu ryu.
[2016/01/19 16:16:46] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/01/19 16:16:51] <Tobbi> So, probably not very far.
[2016/01/19 16:16:52] <leyyin> idk, I do not care
[2016/01/19 16:16:55] <leyyin> they do not work ;)
[2016/01/19 16:17:01] <Tobbi> Anyway, the main reason for me doing this is to get some sports.
[2016/01/19 16:17:08] <Tobbi> And to meet people.
[2016/01/19 16:17:10] <leyyin> that is good
[2016/01/19 16:17:16] <leyyin> but do not pretend is for self defence
[2016/01/19 16:17:31] <Tobbi> leyyin: I don't. Although I used some of it, and it worked...
[2016/01/19 16:17:44] <Tobbi> but might've been just me.
[2016/01/19 16:18:08] <leyyin> it is good for exercising
[2016/01/19 16:19:08] <jesusalva> Tobbi: I remember a movie where a person tried to apply Karate to self defense. The other one just displayed a pistol and said: "Bye."
[2016/01/19 16:19:23] <Tobbi> leyyin: In later grades, you learn how to fight with open hands and you even fight to get the brown (?) belt?
[2016/01/19 16:19:29] <Tobbi> Or maybe the black one. I don't know.
[2016/01/19 16:19:46] <leyyin> then I come and hit you between your manly hood and you are dead
[2016/01/19 16:20:08] <Tobbi> leyyin: 1) I won't be dead if you kick my balls. 2) we know how to defend against that. Unless you're good.
[2016/01/19 16:20:17] <Tobbi> And I don't think you are :D
[2016/01/19 16:20:30] <leyyin> look at MMA
[2016/01/19 16:20:33] <Tobbi> MMA?
[2016/01/19 16:20:37] <leyyin> that is close to street fighting
[2016/01/19 16:20:41] <leyyin> how real life works
[2016/01/19 16:21:34] <Tobbi> leyyin: Probably. But as I said, this is my sports...and I don't do it for self-defence. It is somewhat challenging as well.
[2016/01/19 16:22:10] <leyyin> yes, but the majority of people swear that is for self defense, and you become some fighing ninja or something
[2016/01/19 16:22:13] <leyyin> which is not true
[2016/01/19 16:23:01] <Tobbi> leyyin: It certainly isn't true. And I never really did it under that pretext...
[2016/01/19 16:23:13] <Tobbi> leyyin: I actually did it when I was younger because a friend of mine did it as well.
[2016/01/19 16:23:22] <Tobbi> And I've just become accustomed to that circle of people.
[2016/01/19 16:24:17] <Tobbi> leyyin: But what I hated was when I was really bad and there was someone picking at me... and boosting his confidence by seemingly putting me down. And I couldn't stand it. I really have a problem with authoritative people.
[2016/01/19 16:24:44] <Tobbi> leyyin: You know, I'd never talk like that to beginners. I tend to make jokes or silly remarks...
[2016/01/19 16:24:55] <Tobbi> Just to be *not* that way.
[2016/01/19 16:25:17] <leyyin> what are you talking about?
[2016/01/19 16:25:30] <Tobbi> leyyin: Not having respect of beginners.
[2016/01/19 16:25:36] <Tobbi> Or putting people down because they are bad.
[2016/01/19 16:25:43] <Tobbi> Or thinking you're better than them.
[2016/01/19 16:25:51] <Tobbi> I'm exactly trying not to be that way.
[2016/01/19 16:25:55] <Tobbi> :)
[2016/01/19 16:26:00] <Tobbi> Maybe sometimes a little too hard :P

[2016/01/20 09:01:47] <mcmic_> How can I ask the game to update language packs? (if possible at all)
[2016/01/20 09:02:22] <mt> mcmic_: you uninstall and install them

[2016/01/20 09:04:13] <mcmic_> mt: ok thanks
[2016/01/20 09:04:28] <mt> you have to 'Check online' before that
[2016/01/20 09:04:38] <mt> so it actually realizes there's a new version
[2016/01/20 09:04:57] <mcmic_> And is there any way to reinit the story mode? (From the game)
[2016/01/20 09:05:21] <mt> cheat menu allows resetting worldmaps
[2016/01/20 09:05:39] <mcmic_> Iâm going to try and speedrun supertux: http://www.speedrun.com/SuperTux#Any If any of you wants to compete :-)
[2016/01/20 09:05:48] <mt> you could also change to another profile (that will cause loss of progress of all other worlds too)
[2016/01/20 09:06:57] <mcmic_> Hum yeah just saw that but switching profile runs the intro again this will be annoying
[2016/01/20 09:07:15] <mcmic_> Oh I can quit the level and start right away
[2016/01/20 09:07:41] <mcmic_> Thatâs a good way. But what about when Iâll have use all profiles? Can I delete them?
[2016/01/20 09:08:43] <mt> not from the UI
[2016/01/20 09:08:51] <mt> I think
[2016/01/20 09:09:27] <mcmic_> ok :-/
[2016/01/20 09:09:34] <mcmic_> Where is the cheat menu?
[2016/01/20 09:10:11] <mt> you can enable that when you start supertux with the --developer command line option or run a debug build
[2016/01/20 09:10:34] <mcmic_> ok
[2016/01/20 09:11:04] <mcmic_> mt: But how do I uninstall the language pack? it seems uncheck it does nothing even after restart
[2016/01/20 09:11:45] <mt> there's also the translations shipped with the release
[2016/01/20 09:11:49] <mt> it will use those

[2016/01/20 09:13:02] <mt> whatever there might be a bug which results in supertux not using the translation packs at all, we're not too sure about this
[2016/01/20 09:13:12] <mcmic_> :-/
[2016/01/20 09:13:27] <mt> needs fixing in 0.4.1
[2016/01/20 09:13:29] <mcmic_> Thatâs sad because the french translation packed is in really bad shape
[2016/01/20 09:16:19] <mt> sadly there's quite a lot of bugs in the 0.4.0 release
[2016/01/20 09:16:40] <mt> which we didn't notice because so few people reported bugs before the release :(
[2016/01/20 09:16:54] <mcmic_> Yeah, thatâs always the problem
[2016/01/20 09:17:29] <mcmic_> What you can do next time is make an RC and press the Arch packager to package it. Arch users are used to early adopt things and report problems
[2016/01/20 09:18:08] <mt> the thing is, Arch is only one distro
[2016/01/20 09:18:13] <mcmic_> But same for me, I tested because it was the new release and I went and fixed a lot of things in the french translations
[2016/01/20 09:18:29] <mt> won't notice problems specific to Windows
[2016/01/20 09:18:41] <mcmic_> I hoped the language pack system would help :-/
[2016/01/20 09:18:43] <mcmic_> Yeah, true
[2016/01/20 09:18:48] <mt> and even though our development snapshots were packaged
[2016/01/20 09:18:59] <mt> nobody really cared about supertux
[2016/01/20 09:19:12] <mt> because people didn't think the project was really being active anymore
[2016/01/20 09:19:20] <mcmic_> true

[2016/01/20 13:44:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: By the way: Changing the github rendering system to make stl render as text is too great an issue.
[2016/01/20 13:44:53] <Tobbi> Thus, they won't do it.
[2016/01/20 13:45:38] <Hume2> It looks like reality after i read that thing :D

[2016/01/20 13:47:50] <Hume2> GitHub supports open-source, but they aren't open-source themselves.

[2016/01/21 08:56:42] <Tobbi> leyyin: Germany is regulation-crazy.
[2016/01/21 08:56:50] <leyyin> as it should be
[2016/01/21 08:57:15] <leyyin> how is regular checks, crazy?
[2016/01/21 08:57:17] <head8debian> You get all these electronics on cars now-a-days, and up here in MI cars start rusting in just a couple years.
[2016/01/21 08:57:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: Not overly crazy...My car mechanic told me what he needed to fix in order for me to pass.
[2016/01/21 08:57:51] <leyyin> some mechanics just want to take your money :P
[2016/01/21 08:58:09] <Tobbi> leyyin: And that's exactly why I took one that was recommended to me.
[2016/01/21 08:58:20] <head8debian> Lets jsut say, our goverment has come a long ways from what we were founded on...
[2016/01/21 08:58:22] <leyyin> ah ok
[2016/01/21 08:58:24] <Tobbi> leyyin: I never go to the car brand mechanics... They charge you a lot.
[2016/01/21 08:58:38] <leyyin> sigh, muricans
[2016/01/21 08:59:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, what was fixed on my car was: lights, ABS, fixing this rather lose back of my car's body...
[2016/01/21 08:59:08] <Tobbi> and I think something else.
[2016/01/21 08:59:14] <Tobbi> ah cleaning engine etc.
[2016/01/21 08:59:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: Eww. o_O
[2016/01/21 08:59:22] <leyyin> that is good
[2016/01/21 08:59:33] <Tobbi> head8debian: What's eww...?
[2016/01/21 08:59:35] <leyyin> would you have done the check if you were not required to do so? Tobbi
[2016/01/21 08:59:43] <Tobbi> leyyin: Of course not. Who do you think I am.
[2016/01/21 08:59:45] <head8debian> That you didn't get it fixed in the first place.
[2016/01/21 08:59:57] <head8debian> lol!
[2016/01/21 09:00:08] <leyyin> and that is why it must be mandatory
[2016/01/21 09:00:15] <leyyin> because a lot of people do this
[2016/01/21 09:00:38] <Tobbi> leyyin: I was even driving on the road with no lights :D
[2016/01/21 09:00:51] <leyyin> see, people are stupid :D
[2016/01/21 09:00:56] <head8debian> Whats funny is, in one of our states we wont let semi's into for emission reasons, but we will let the trucks sit and idle on the states border. :p
[2016/01/21 09:01:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Thats a little dangerous.
[2016/01/21 09:01:21] <head8debian> See, we know to take better care of our cars than that. :p
[2016/01/21 09:01:26] <Tobbi> leyyin: Also, my car mechanic deduced something from the original cost estimate because it didn't take him as long as expected.
[2016/01/21 09:01:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: If the police caught me, I'd have gotten a massive fine.
[2016/01/21 09:01:49] <Tobbi> *had caught me
[2016/01/21 09:02:10] * leyyin reports Tobbi to the police
[2016/01/21 09:02:18] <leyyin> damn, I can't sprechen sie deuche
[2016/01/21 09:02:33] <Tobbi> leyyin: You got it all wrong. It's "Sprechen Sie English?"

[2016/01/21 09:03:42] <leyyin> yup
[2016/01/21 09:03:46] <Tobbi> leyyin: How often?

[2016/01/21 09:05:06] <Tobbi> leyyin: If you put a police sirene on top of your car and don't have a license, you pay...
[2016/01/21 09:05:07] <Tobbi> wait for it...
[2016/01/21 09:05:14] <Tobbi> 10 Euros.
[2016/01/21 09:05:23] <leyyin> and you drive?

[2016/01/21 12:32:03] <pentagon> [10supertux] 07brmbrmcar closed pull request 09#340: Add ghost() command to Console 13https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/340
[2016/01/21 12:32:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: I created a prototype of a project tree thingy (which is currently just a file tree) and an "addon wizard" in https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/tree/create_addon
[2016/01/21 12:32:56] <brmbrmcar> I dibn'tmean toleave there, I accidentally pressed the close button and this emulator has no warnings.
[2016/01/21 12:33:02] <Tobbi> ah, okay.
[2016/01/21 12:33:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: Cool! Let me take a look...
[2016/01/21 12:40:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: Wow, it's pretty nice.
[2016/01/21 12:40:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: Just a basic prototype... We still have a long way to go with this.
[2016/01/21 12:41:53] <mt> brmbrmcar: tmux/screen might be useful
[2016/01/21 12:42:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: I reckon we should keep all the files in the project stored in the ~/.flexlay folder.
[2016/01/21 12:42:44] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, I'll change it.
[2016/01/21 12:43:10] <Tobbi> Karkus: Do we allow the user to change it anyway?
[2016/01/21 12:43:34] <Karkus> Tobbi: I mean, all the resources they import (images etc.)
[2016/01/21 12:43:46] <Tobbi> Ah, yup.
[2016/01/21 12:43:52] <mt> people will complain when they need to open a .directory
[2016/01/21 12:44:04] <Karkus> mt: .supertux2 ?
[2016/01/21 12:44:15] <mt> .supertux2 is not something one needs to access
[2016/01/21 12:44:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am talking about user-defined resources, anyway...?
[2016/01/21 12:44:27] <Tobbi> I mean: Just making sure we're on the same page here.
[2016/01/21 12:44:38] <mt> also, ~/.flexlay should be changed to follow XDG
[2016/01/21 12:44:46] <Karkus> mt: Nor will .flexlay. I intend Flexlay to look there.
[2016/01/21 12:45:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: Which resources aren't user-defined?
[2016/01/21 12:45:14] <Tobbi> Karkus: The ones shipped with SuperTux :P
[2016/01/21 12:45:21] <mt> what if a user wants to access their project's files?
[2016/01/21 12:45:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes.
[2016/01/21 12:45:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: We are on the same page there.
[2016/01/21 12:45:31] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/01/21 12:45:31] <mt> which, to me, seems a pretty common thing
[2016/01/21 12:45:41] <Karkus> mt: They will be able to export the project
[2016/01/21 12:45:46] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2016/01/21 12:45:53] <Tobbi> That's what I had in mind as well.
[2016/01/21 12:45:59] <Karkus> mt: Unless you'd rather leave it up to them?
[2016/01/21 12:46:20] <mt> flexlay is also supposed to keep the more advanced users in mind
[2016/01/21 12:46:32] <mt> and what if we change something of the addon format in supertux
[2016/01/21 12:46:42] <mt> but don't want to immediately do in flexlay
[2016/01/21 12:47:04] <mt> sure we can have an export option
[2016/01/21 12:47:11] <Karkus> mt: The same applies to levels.
[2016/01/21 12:47:25] <mt> also, not storing projects in flexlay might confuse users
[2016/01/21 12:47:33] <mt> who don't know about .directories
[2016/01/21 12:47:35] <Karkus> mt: There will always be the option to save your project wherever you like.
[2016/01/21 12:47:43] <mt> ah well then
[2016/01/21 12:48:03] <Karkus> mt: I will try to give people options. :D
[2016/01/21 12:48:42] <Tobbi> I'd prefer having the Properties|Project View tabs at the bottom, but apparently PyQT won't allow me to do that :P
[2016/01/21 12:50:15] <Tobbi> Being able to load ZIP files should be integrated as well.
[2016/01/21 12:50:43] <Tobbi> Actually, let's call those items Import... and Export...
[2016/01/21 12:51:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes, but then what if they try to modify the ZIP files?
[2016/01/21 12:51:18] <Karkus> Do we create them a new project?
[2016/01/21 12:51:41] <Tobbi> Karkus: hmm...why would one try to modify the zip files?
[2016/01/21 12:52:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: Let's say I get angry at Hume2's levels (of course). I load them up and start to edit them...
[2016/01/21 12:52:39] <Tobbi> Ah...
[2016/01/21 12:53:02] <Tobbi> Karkus: okay, that's a problem... We could possibly save them over...
[2016/01/21 12:53:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: We can either extract it all into the projects folder, or...
[2016/01/21 12:53:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: But that could be a pain...
[2016/01/21 12:53:30] <Tobbi> Karkus: I'd say we read from the ZIP and extract to a temporary directory.

[2016/01/21 12:53:44] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay.
[2016/01/21 12:53:46] <Tobbi> And then we can always export to ZIP...
[2016/01/21 12:53:48] <mt> extract to memory :D
[2016/01/21 12:54:01] <Tobbi> mt: lol
[2016/01/21 12:54:22] <mt> well possibly python could load a ZIP to make it look like a directory in the oS
[2016/01/21 12:54:24] <Karkus> mt: No, it's not that simple. If they want to edit many of the levels...
[2016/01/21 12:54:26] <mt> s/oS/OS/
[2016/01/21 12:54:26] <red_bot> mt meant: "well possibly python could load a ZIP to make it look like a directory in the OS"
[2016/01/21 12:54:42] <Tobbi> Perhaps this could work.

[2016/01/21 12:58:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am not *that* happy with the file tree...because it only shows what's present in the file system.
[2016/01/21 12:58:05] <pentagon> [10flexlay] 07Karkus476 commented on issue 09#60: Improve user-friendliness of layers 13https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/issues/60
[2016/01/21 12:58:34] <Karkus> Tobbi: In the project view?
[2016/01/21 12:58:41] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes.
[2016/01/21 12:58:57] <Tobbi> I mean: It's somewhat nice as well...
[2016/01/21 12:59:17] <Tobbi> but, still... we need to check those existing folders for non-emptiness before exporting to an add-on.
[2016/01/21 12:59:27] <Tobbi> If they're empty, no need to export them.
[2016/01/21 13:00:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yup. I'm going to look at fixing the Layer Selector.
[2016/01/21 13:00:58] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2016/01/21 13:02:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am thinking that during the export stage to ZIP we can apply a series of streamlining steps: Removing empty tilemaps, checking the scripts etc...
[2016/01/21 13:02:31] <Tobbi> But that's for the future.
[2016/01/21 13:03:18] <brmbrmcar> Is this addonauto-generation?
[2016/01/21 13:03:47] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: No, just packaging of add-ons.
[2016/01/21 13:05:04] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2016/01/21 13:05:34] <brmbrmcar> I honestly haveno idea how I zipped some addons previously...
[2016/01/21 13:07:16] <Tobbi> It's not so difficult.

[2016/01/22 06:53:32] <snadge> presumably its not that difficult to add translations, if you know both english AND the language you want to support
[2016/01/22 06:53:45] <snadge> usually just string tables.. why would you moan about something like that.. sigh
[2016/01/22 06:54:05] <snadge> who is CT anyway? :P
[2016/01/22 06:54:20] <snadge> that waves of frogs level is evil
[2016/01/22 06:55:35] <snadge> its levels like that.. that make me want to hack an instant fire flower button
[2016/01/22 06:55:55] <snadge> its painful to have to go to another level.. to get the fireflower, every time you want to attempt it
[2016/01/22 06:56:31] <snadge> you get one turtle as ammo.. and you're supposed to avoid like 50 frogs
[2016/01/22 06:57:17] <mt> some addon levels are evil and don't follow the style guidelines
[2016/01/22 06:57:21] <snadge> i guess if you restart before you die.. you can get the flower back
[2016/01/22 06:57:41] <snadge> but its just remembering to do that.. instead of continuing and trying your luck
[2016/01/22 06:58:12] <snadge> some of the insanely hard levels are what keep me playing the game though.. infuriatingly difficult
[2016/01/22 06:58:32] <snadge> then when you beat them.. you cant help exclaim profanity and jump out of your seat ;)

[2016/01/22 06:59:35] <snadge> %2F ?
[2016/01/22 06:59:40] <mt> It appears using "Find file" and in the clone of the git repo, but 404
[2016/01/22 06:59:52] <mt> %2F is the HTTP encoding for /

[2016/01/22 07:01:07] <mt> yeah
[2016/01/22 07:01:28] <mt> but that wiki is obsolete
[2016/01/22 07:02:21] <mt> most of its content but mainly the hosting infrastructure
[2016/01/22 07:03:12] <mt> I'd even be ok with not hosting all the stuff on GitHub and decentralize it a bit more
[2016/01/22 07:03:19] <mt> But we don't have the infrastructure
[2016/01/22 07:03:49] <snadge> lol every frustrating level i have played violates one or more of those guidelines
[2016/01/22 07:04:00] <snadge> more than 3 enemies on the screen made me lol
[2016/01/22 07:07:55] <snadge> seriously though.. CT should be punished, whomever that is
[2016/01/22 07:08:09] <mt> a previous supertux contributor :P
[2016/01/22 07:08:48] <mt> snadge: is putting that in the /topic a punishment enough? :D

[2016/01/22 07:10:54] <snadge> im actually okay with incredibly difficult levels on one condition.. they post a video on youtube of them completing it

[2016/01/22 07:15:23] <Tobbi> I'd say ignoring him is the best way to go about it.
[2016/01/22 07:15:24] <mt> yes there is
[2016/01/22 07:15:33] <Tobbi> mt: So?
[2016/01/22 07:15:54] <mt> if (at least one/all) owner(s) of the supertux/supertux repo block him he won't be able to post an issue etc.
[2016/01/22 07:16:42] <mt> when you open https://github.com/Savsish there's that little menu with the ! sign, there you can choose to block a user
[2016/01/22 07:17:20] <Tobbi> hmm, okay I did that.
[2016/01/22 07:21:31] <snadge> i dont know about the console or the cheat menu
[2016/01/22 07:22:00] <snadge> i've played every level in existence without it .. pretty much.. finished the entire game, and most of the contrib levels :p
[2016/01/22 07:22:22] <Tobbi> snadge: I think having those really hard levels adds some variety to the game.
[2016/01/22 07:24:54] <Tobbi> but that might be only me.
[2016/01/22 07:34:43] <snadge> i guess if you make them optional
[2016/01/22 07:34:56] @ Quit: lumidify: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2016/01/22 07:35:08] <snadge> theres an optional level in this map that i skipped because it enraged me
[2016/01/22 07:35:23] <snadge> but i usually cant help myself and go back and finish them after i've completed the game

[2016/01/22 12:24:10] <Tobbi> brmbrmrv: Learn it.
[2016/01/22 12:24:28] <Tobbi> a) it's easy, b) you can program the editor, c) you don't get on our nerves.
[2016/01/22 12:25:02] <Tobbi> Same goes for you, leyyin :D
[2016/01/22 12:25:17] <brmbrmrv> It is harder to write editors inPython!

[2016/01/22 14:46:14] <Hume2> Maybe, I didn't examined it.

[2016/01/22 14:50:48] <brmbrmcar> But irssi is way smaller on apt-get.
[2016/01/22 14:51:00] <mt> there's other weechat plugins but they're not relevant for irc functionality
[2016/01/22 14:52:15] <jesusalva_> mt: If IRSSI was that bad, no one would be using it. And if Weechat was *that* good, everyone would use it (and CTCP Version would always say that)
[2016/01/22 14:52:23] <brmbrmcar> I want a proper desktop.
[2016/01/22 14:52:24] <mt> furthermore, using addons weechat supports triggers (irssi triggers.pl equivalent)
[2016/01/22 14:52:33] <mt> s/addons/plugins
[2016/01/22 14:52:45] <mt> C plugins are usually faster compared to scripts
[2016/01/22 14:52:56] <mt> well, I do know of people using irssi but not liking it
[2016/01/22 14:53:12] <mt> and then there's people who don't know what they're doing
[2016/01/22 14:53:22] <mt> and those who don't want to use CLI clients
[2016/01/22 14:55:06] <brmbrmcar> I am still with irssi.
[2016/01/22 14:55:31] <mt> just out of curiosity, why?
[2016/01/22 14:55:40] <mt> I don't want to force you to use weechat
[2016/01/22 14:56:09] <mt> however I can say I like WeeChat and it has some advantages (from my point of view) over irssi
[2016/01/22 14:56:14] <brmbrmcar> I like the terminal.
[2016/01/22 14:56:21] <brmbrmcar> It  is just so awesome.
[2016/01/22 14:56:48] <brmbrmcar> Why don't online clients like "normal" hosts?
[2016/01/22 14:58:52] * jesusalva_ checks that head8debian is still using IRSSI.

[2016/01/23 06:44:50] <mt> wait
[2016/01/23 06:45:17] <mt> are target times the recommended times that mark the level yellow in the worldmap if you've finished them in a shorter time
[2016/01/23 06:45:24] <mt> or are they the time limit as in M1
[2016/01/23 06:46:45] <brmbrmcar> THe first one. Although I never noticed them go yellow.
[2016/01/23 06:46:57] <brmbrmcar> @sBut that is what I mean.
[2016/01/23 06:47:26] <mt> well they're somewhat green and glow yellow in a specific time interval
[2016/01/23 06:47:32] <mt> and yeah, you can add them
[2016/01/23 06:48:08] <mt> I'd suggest looking at the time limits from M1, maybe they could be used to specify a target time
[2016/01/23 06:48:13] <brmbrmcar> OK.

[2016/01/23 08:50:05] <Hume2_>  /nick Hume2
[2016/01/23 08:50:10] <Hume2_> Not working!
[2016/01/23 08:50:15] <brmbrmcar> Don't kick yourself!
[2016/01/23 08:50:27] <brmbrmcar> Hume2 hasn't timed out.
[2016/01/23 08:50:44] <brmbrmcar> And now you made it much harder to find out when it does.
[2016/01/23 08:50:59] <mt> Hume2_: that's because kick kicks you from the channel, not the network
[2016/01/23 08:51:12] <Hume2_> Oh, I forgot.
[2016/01/23 08:51:17] <mt> you'd search for /kill, which is oper-only
[2016/01/23 08:51:37] <mt> or /ns ghost Hume2, /nick Hume2, or just /ns regain Hume2
[2016/01/23 08:51:47] @ Hume2_ is now known as Hume2
[2016/01/23 08:51:57] <Hume2> That works, thanks.
[2016/01/23 08:54:09] <brmbrmcar> mt: Are you an operator?
[2016/01/23 08:54:51] @ brmbrmcar left channel #supertux (requested by mt (I'd totally suggest you to look at my cloak, and no, I'm not an IRC Operator))
[2016/01/23 08:55:42] <Hume2> Yes, he is.
[2016/01/23 08:56:35] <mt> I think brmbrmcar meant IRC operator
[2016/01/23 08:56:51] <mt> which I'm not

[2016/01/23 08:59:58] <mt> away nicks aren't considered a good practice
[2016/01/23 09:17:24] <head8debian> I don't even do away stuff... It isn't worth it IMHO.

[2016/01/23 10:09:27] <qwebirc42066> Hello bros.
[2016/01/23 10:09:50] <qwebirc42066> I need some help.
[2016/01/23 10:09:58] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Use /afk
[2016/01/23 10:10:16] <head8debian> qwebirc42066: Hey. Please ask you question and we will do our best to respond. :)
[2016/01/23 10:10:25] <qwebirc42066> I am using Lubuntu 14.04.
[2016/01/23 10:10:44] <qwebirc42066> I want to install SuperTux Level Editor for 0.4.
[2016/01/23 10:11:11] <qwebirc42066> I will make a story mode-like world.
[2016/01/23 10:11:11] <head8debian> qwebirc42066: Ok, how far have you gotten so far?
[2016/01/23 10:11:14] <mt> brmbrmcar: there's the /away command, it's not /afk
[2016/01/23 10:11:17] <qwebirc42066> Well.
[2016/01/23 10:11:27] <head8debian> mt: Oops. *facepalm*...
[2016/01/23 10:11:32] <qwebirc42066> I am new in Linux but I know few commands.
[2016/01/23 10:11:55] <qwebirc42066> I am 13 so... I know sudo, git, su etc.
[2016/01/23 10:11:55] <head8debian> qwebirc42066: Ok, cool. So have you downloaded the level editor yet?
[2016/01/23 10:12:03] <head8debian> :)
[2016/01/23 10:12:22] <qwebirc42066> I started Lunux today for first time.
[2016/01/23 10:12:32] <qwebirc42066> Pretty nice OS.
[2016/01/23 10:12:51] <qwebirc42066> Windows sucks :D
[2016/01/23 10:13:22] <head8debian> qwebirc42066: Well, there is alot to learn about it. ;) Read,read and read some more. ;)
[2016/01/23 10:13:28] <qwebirc42066> So If you are able to help add me on Skype.

[2016/01/23 10:13:51] <qwebirc42066> I am actually Bulgarian.
[2016/01/23 10:13:58] <head8debian> qwebirc42066: I would like to help more, and talk to you more, but my dad needs me to go outside now. :(
[2016/01/23 10:14:20] <qwebirc42066> Git is giving me error.
[2016/01/23 10:14:31] <mt> qwebirc42066: what error?
[2016/01/23 10:14:36] <qwebirc42066> I have enabled Cannonical Partners.
[2016/01/23 10:14:41] <head8debian> So i will try to catch you later.
[2016/01/23 10:14:55] <mt> shouldn't even need canonical partners repos
[2016/01/23 10:14:56] <qwebirc42066> Add me on Skype: g.s.vasilev
[2016/01/23 10:15:08] <mt> no skype here
[2016/01/23 10:15:15] <qwebirc42066> I can share you screen.
[2016/01/23 10:15:23] <qwebirc42066> Or wait.
[2016/01/23 10:15:28] <mt> you can pastebin the output of your terminal
[2016/01/23 10:15:44] <mt> whatever is more than 3 lines: please don't paste it in here
[2016/01/23 10:15:57] <qwebirc42066> I will get Lightshot is it availble for Lubuntu Linux?
[2016/01/23 10:16:35] <mt> google search says it's for 'Mac & Win'
[2016/01/23 10:16:51] <qwebirc42066> I have Wine...
[2016/01/23 10:17:21] <mt> You can take a screenshot using the PrintScreen key on your keyboard
[2016/01/23 10:17:32] <mt> and upload it to imgur or whatever
[2016/01/23 10:17:53] <mt> however, I do recommend you to just pastebin the error
[2016/01/23 10:18:00] <qwebirc42066> I will upload it on Bulgarian site, OK?
[2016/01/23 10:18:25] <mt> e.g. using https://gist.github.com/ or http://dpaste.com/
[2016/01/23 10:18:38] <qwebirc42066> http://prikachi.com/
[2016/01/23 10:19:04] <qwebirc42066> Is it OK?
[2016/01/23 10:19:14] <mt> well, if it doesn't do any bad things to our browsers
[2016/01/23 10:19:35] <qwebirc42066> It does not.
[2016/01/23 10:19:52] <qwebirc42066> If you do not trust me I will use Google Drive.
[2016/01/23 10:20:01] <mt> nah, you can use it
[2016/01/23 10:20:35] <qwebirc42066> 1) I pressed Ctrl + Alt + T
[2016/01/23 10:21:26] <mt> qwebirc42066: why can't you just use a pastebin?
[2016/01/23 10:21:28] <mt> it's not that hard
[2016/01/23 10:21:49] <mt> and to take a screenshot on lubuntu, you'd most likely use PrintScreen
[2016/01/23 10:21:53] <qwebirc42066> It is quite complicated to me -_-
[2016/01/23 10:22:12] <mt> well pastebinning an error is like
[2016/01/23 10:22:21] <qwebirc42066> I will send you txt document.
[2016/01/23 10:22:23] <mt> in your terminal select the text with the error
[2016/01/23 10:22:35] <mt> right click, and Copy
[2016/01/23 10:22:40] <mt> go to a pastebin site
[2016/01/23 10:22:54] <qwebirc42066> What commands to follow.
[2016/01/23 10:22:56] <mt> right-click, Paste, click paste on the paste website
[2016/01/23 10:23:08] <qwebirc42066> I have even moved from BG server to cental.
[2016/01/23 10:23:11] <mt> well if there's a git error you'd already have a command
[2016/01/23 10:23:30] <qwebirc42066> Central*
[2016/01/23 10:24:08] <qwebirc42066> I use: sudo apt-get install supertux-editor-git
[2016/01/23 10:24:30] <qwebirc42066> Entered password.
[2016/01/23 10:24:33] <mt> supertux-editor-git isn't a package in ubuntu
[2016/01/23 10:24:37] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/23 10:24:45] <mt> you need to compile the editor yourself
[2016/01/23 10:24:53] <qwebirc42066> How?
[2016/01/23 10:25:47] <mt> we actually have different editors right now
[2016/01/23 10:26:02] <mt> I'd suggest you to use flexlay, as that's the easiest to install right now
[2016/01/23 10:26:19] <qwebirc42066> How to install it?
[2016/01/23 10:26:31] <mt> installing on ubuntu based distros is documented at https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/wiki/Installing-the-Flexlay-SuperTux-editor
[2016/01/23 10:27:05] <qwebirc42066> Well Ubuntu is equal  to Debian, am I right?
[2016/01/23 10:27:35] <mt> not binary compatible
[2016/01/23 10:27:48] <qwebirc42066> I have done that command...
[2016/01/23 10:27:55] <mt> but the commands documented there work equally on all debian-based distros
[2016/01/23 10:27:59] <mt> which command?
[2016/01/23 10:28:10] <qwebirc42066> git clone https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay.git
[2016/01/23 10:28:21] <mt> you need to `sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pyqt4`

[2016/01/23 10:34:22] <mt> `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`
[2016/01/23 10:34:29] <mt> and then run the commands again
[2016/01/23 10:34:35] <mt> it should be English now
[2016/01/23 10:34:41] <qwebirc42066> Ok.
[2016/01/23 10:34:49] <qwebirc42066> So you can understand?

[2016/01/23 10:37:33] <mt> I'd suggest asking #ubuntu about the internet connection problem
[2016/01/23 10:37:38] <mt> can't help you with that now
[2016/01/23 10:37:40] @ Mathnerd314 joined channel #supertux
[2016/01/23 10:37:53] <qwebirc42066> How to fix the unicode?
[2016/01/23 10:38:10] <mt> I'm not sure about your configuration
[2016/01/23 10:38:23] <mt> and I'm not in the mood of explaining all things Linux right now
[2016/01/23 10:38:42] <qwebirc42066> What do you want me to use as an info?
[2016/01/23 10:39:09] <mt> I told you you can ask the #ubuntu channel
[2016/01/23 10:39:16] <mt> it's also on this IRC network
[2016/01/23 10:39:19] <qwebirc42066> Wait
[2016/01/23 10:39:29] <mt> you can use the /join command to join a channel
[2016/01/23 10:40:15] <qwebirc42066> Or just click on #ubuntu
[2016/01/23 10:43:14] <mt> I'd even ask for help about the internet problem, anyway to get rid of the unicode you might just want to close the current terminal window and open a new one
[2016/01/23 11:12:43] <qwebirc42066> I fixed unicode.
[2016/01/23 11:12:52] <qwebirc42066> I am going in English.
[2016/01/23 11:13:08] <qwebirc42066> Since Ubuntu team is Braindead.

[2016/01/23 11:32:15] <brmbrmcar> What does /away do?
[2016/01/23 11:32:19] <mt> /i-am-not-here-right-now
[2016/01/23 11:32:29] <mt> /user-not-on-their-computer
[2016/01/23 11:32:34] <mt> /unavailable
[2016/01/23 11:32:37] <mt> lol
[2016/01/23 11:32:46] <mt> brmbrmcar: it marks you as away
[2016/01/23 11:33:13] <mt> visible in whois, who or when you PM a user who is away
[2016/01/23 11:33:46] <qwebirc42066> Bro I have suggestions for Milestone 3.
[2016/01/23 11:34:05] <qwebirc42066> Add better graphics.
[2016/01/23 11:34:14] <qwebirc42066> And add blood.
[2016/01/23 11:34:18] <qwebirc42066> Add voice.
[2016/01/23 11:34:18] <mt> can you stop prefixing messages with 'Bro'
[2016/01/23 11:34:32] <qwebirc42066> Okay. Then Sensei.
[2016/01/23 11:35:15] <mt> stop prefixing messages with anything unrelated
[2016/01/23 11:35:26] <brmbrmcar> Not visible in my whois.
[2016/01/23 11:35:27] <mt> and generally, more constructive suggestions for improvements
[2016/01/23 11:35:37] <mt> brmbrmcar: you have to set /away
[2016/01/23 11:35:44] <brmbrmcar> I did.
[2016/01/23 11:35:50] <mt> brmbrmcar: oh and just `/away` will un-set the away status
[2016/01/23 11:35:56] <brmbrmcar> Oh.
[2016/01/23 11:36:03] <mt> `/away I'm not here right now` should work
[2016/01/23 11:36:04] <brmbrmcar> THat'll be why.
[2016/01/23 11:36:26] <qwebirc42066> @mt Add these, they will make the game cooler. Make guns in the shop to be sold.
[2016/01/23 11:36:33] <brmbrmcar> I did it multiple times because it didn't seem to do anything.
[2016/01/23 11:36:47] <mt> >guns
[2016/01/23 11:36:50] <brmbrmcar> Guns? Blood?
[2016/01/23 11:36:50] <mt> excuse me
[2016/01/23 11:36:56] <mt> this is not a shooting game
[2016/01/23 11:37:00] <qwebirc42066> Other: Add spells.
[2016/01/23 11:37:54] <qwebirc42066> Like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEOAR3Uq4oE
[2016/01/23 11:37:58] <mt> for now, let's focus on releasing 0.4.1 and adding the improvements as described in the updated M3 design document in the topic

[2016/01/23 11:40:12] <mt> >Tux bigger
[2016/01/23 11:40:17] <mt> that will break everything
[2016/01/23 11:40:36] <qwebirc42066> When eats an egg - He becomes even more bigger.

[2016/01/23 11:41:02] <brmbrmcar> Tux should reject multiple eggs.
[2016/01/23 11:41:20] <qwebirc42066> One more.
[2016/01/23 11:42:19] <qwebirc42066> When he gets the fire flower but before collecting it gets hit, Instead of fireballs power make it work as an egg.

[2016/01/23 11:56:31] <brmbrmcar> Haven't a clue.
[2016/01/23 11:57:02] <brmbrmcar> Try Flexlay (it isn't as good, but it works).
[2016/01/23 11:57:14] <brmbrmcar> It is in development.
[2016/01/23 11:57:20] <Hume2> Windows 10? Poor boy...
[2016/01/23 11:57:42] <polyphagia> the latest intel CPUs won't support windows 7 on purpose
[2016/01/23 11:57:58] <polyphagia> drop windows while you can
[2016/01/23 11:58:10] <qwebirc42066> I am on Intel Pentium 4 :D
[2016/01/23 11:58:18] <Hume2> Yeah, those silly Windows things.

[2016/01/23 11:59:16] <Hume2> I have already metioned it as joke :D
[2016/01/23 11:59:35] <qwebirc42066> Totally different from other OSs.
[2016/01/23 11:59:35] <Hume2> For now, it's just a joke.
[2016/01/23 11:59:47] <brmbrmcar> SuperTux OS.
[2016/01/23 11:59:55] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2016/01/23 11:59:56] <qwebirc42066> Well...

[2016/01/23 15:29:31] <Hume2> I've never taken seriously those "Enter your phone number".
[2016/01/23 15:29:33] <Tobbi> polyphagia: I would've probably tried to fire up that-sniffer-whose-name-I-don't-remember and got their IP address.
[2016/01/23 15:30:22] <polyphagia> Hume2: you have to provide your phone number to sign up for most email services now
[2016/01/23 15:30:24] <polyphagia> which is awful imo
[2016/01/23 15:30:36] <Jesusaves> I agree with polyphagia
[2016/01/23 15:30:39] <Hume2> Oh, really? Huh.
[2016/01/23 15:30:44] <polyphagia> meh Tobbi these guys can't be stopped
[2016/01/23 15:30:50] <polyphagia> but it's fun to screw around with them
[2016/01/23 15:30:55] <polyphagia> there's a subreddit dedicated to wasting their time
[2016/01/23 15:30:57] <polyphagia> lol
[2016/01/23 15:30:58] <Jesusaves> I tried using 0000-0000 as phone number but was rejected. :P
[2016/01/23 15:31:08] <Hume2> polyphagia: When I see it, I escape or fill in a crap.
[2016/01/23 15:31:22] <polyphagia> even if you do enter a seemingly real number, they SMS you a confirmation
[2016/01/23 15:31:32] <Hume2> Yeah, crappy numbers are usually rejected.
[2016/01/23 15:31:32] <Tobbi> polyphagia: After they contacted me a couple times, I called the local police to find out whether there was something I could've done...
[2016/01/23 15:31:38] <Tobbi> Unfortunately they told me that there wasn't.

[2016/01/23 15:31:42] <polyphagia> yup
[2016/01/23 15:31:44] <Tobbi> Not even they could do anything about it.
[2016/01/23 15:31:47] <polyphagia> there's just too many and it's too profitable
[2016/01/23 15:31:52] <polyphagia> one shuts down, they just move
[2016/01/23 15:31:59] <polyphagia> the only solution is education
[2016/01/23 15:32:02] <Tobbi> yeah.
[2016/01/23 15:32:28] <Hume2> Yeah, don't fill in any number and escape.
[2016/01/23 15:32:29] <Tobbi> polyphagia: But the good thing is: If you waste their time, they'll eventually stop calling you because it's not profitable anymore.
[2016/01/23 15:33:19] <Hume2> You can just answer "What?" to everyhthing.
[2016/01/23 15:33:27] <polyphagia> yeah it's a good solution for *you* but not the general public Tobbi :P
[2016/01/23 15:33:41] <polyphagia> yeah Hume2 i don't  i'm just saying it's a shame that this is the direction things are heading
[2016/01/23 15:33:43] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Well, is there anything else one can do?
[2016/01/23 15:33:49] <polyphagia> i personally don't put my phone number anywhere but most people don't think twice
[2016/01/23 15:34:08] <polyphagia> well i mean most people probably don't want to waste their own time wasting somebody else's Tobbi
[2016/01/23 15:34:24] <Tobbi> polyphagia: That's true. I could've just hung up... :P
[2016/01/23 15:34:36] <Tobbi> I still wonder where they got my phone number from, though.
[2016/01/23 15:34:46] <polyphagia> auto-dialers
[2016/01/23 15:35:01] <Hume2> Maybe.
[2016/01/23 15:35:07] <Tobbi> polyphagia: So, they just try numbers out?
[2016/01/23 15:35:14] <polyphagia> there are these services that call numbers, if you answer it you're added to a list
[2016/01/23 15:35:20] <polyphagia> then people sell the lists
[2016/01/23 15:35:37] <polyphagia> so a solution is not answering calls with weird numbers
[2016/01/23 15:35:57] <polyphagia> Tobbi: usually a third party does and sells them
[2016/01/23 15:36:02] <Hume2> It's not always benefical.
[2016/01/23 15:36:03] <polyphagia> but i don't see why they couldn't themselves
[2016/01/23 15:36:17] <Hume2> Sometimes your friend calls from another number...
[2016/01/23 15:36:22] <Hume2> You know.
[2016/01/23 15:36:34] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Actually, doesn't matter... :) I'll continue wasting their time...
[2016/01/23 15:36:43] <polyphagia> Tobbi: there are lots of videos on youtube of people doing it too
[2016/01/23 15:36:44] <polyphagia> with VMs
[2016/01/23 15:36:52] <polyphagia> one time the east indian got so angry he deleted all the files lol
[2016/01/23 15:36:57] <Hume2> You can even make jokes if you want.
[2016/01/23 15:37:05] <Tobbi> polyphagia: Yeah, I know. I didn't come up with the idea of messing with them on my own.
[2016/01/23 15:37:12] <polyphagia> :P
[2016/01/23 15:37:43] <Hume2> I have my mobile almost always truned off though.
[2016/01/23 15:38:43] <Hume2> Too much comunication drives me mad.
[2016/01/23 15:39:14] <Tobbi> I have no problem with communication.
[2016/01/23 15:40:58] <Hume2> Yes, it's true that many people complain that they can't communicate with me.

[2016/01/23 15:44:57] <Hume2> I personally don't have any problems with communication itself, but I do have problems with all those spammy messages.
[2016/01/23 15:45:46] <Hume2> They just resemble me that I've forgotten something that I wanted to forget.
[2016/01/23 15:48:47] <Hume2> It's more relevant to e-mail though, that I don't like to check out too.
[2016/01/23 15:51:10] <brmbrmcar> I like e-mail sp*m.
[2016/01/23 15:52:43] <Hume2> Yes, but when I chack out e-mail once for a month, just to read all those spams, it gets annoying.
[2016/01/23 15:54:36] <brmbrmcar> I'd like that.

[2016/01/23 19:14:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: Are you sure?
[2016/01/23 19:15:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: Do you really trust him with such privelages?
[2016/01/23 19:15:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: No.
[2016/01/23 19:15:45] <Tobbi> I was probably kidding.
[2016/01/23 19:15:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: And it would probably be better to ask such questions with mt or Karkus or such.
[2016/01/23 19:16:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yeah...But he might have the potential to get added one day...
[2016/01/23 19:16:25] <Tobbi> If he shows serious intent...
[2016/01/23 19:16:28] <head8debian> Maybe one day.
[2016/01/23 19:16:49] <Tobbi> head8debian: I mean some of his contributions are...okay'ish
[2016/01/23 19:17:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: No. Maybe I sucked at git too when I was added, I was also not stupid enough to do anything... damaging...
[2016/01/23 19:18:14] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, then. :)
[2016/01/23 19:18:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: I got Visual Studio to work, kind of...
[2016/01/23 19:18:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Kind of?
[2016/01/23 19:19:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Also, that's not to say I don't think he could be a good contributor, of course
[2016/01/23 19:19:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: Meaning it kind of wants to create a project and doesn't fail with a cryptic error message, but with a rather verbose one which might even be making sense...
[2016/01/23 19:19:26] <Tobbi> ...but I still don't understand why it fails. :D
[2016/01/23 19:19:59] <Tobbi> It's telling me to install Xamarin, but last time I checked, this is already installed.
[2016/01/23 19:20:04] <Tobbi> Maybe I should reinstall it.
[2016/01/23 19:20:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why do you need to use VS?
[2016/01/23 19:21:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: To develop a cross-platform-plugin for Xamarin. Ironic, isn't it?
[2016/01/23 19:21:27] <Karkus> I guess :P
[2016/01/23 19:21:45] <Tobbi> I guess reinstalling Xamarin should do the trick.
[2016/01/23 19:21:49] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/01/23 19:22:14] <Karkus> Have you tried turning it off and on again? ;)
[2016/01/23 19:22:52] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/23 19:23:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: I tried calling 01189998819991197253 about it. They said this wasn't an emergency.
[2016/01/23 19:23:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Damn.
[2016/01/23 19:23:46] <Karkus> :D
[2016/01/23 19:24:00] <Tobbi> Karkus: I got that number remembered, by the way, for emergencies.
[2016/01/23 19:24:02] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/01/23 19:24:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: Maybe that's a good idea
[2016/01/23 19:25:17] <Tobbi> Karkus: tbh, my synesthesia helps a lot when it comes to remembering pointless stuff like this one.
[2016/01/23 19:25:26] <Tobbi> synesthesia + ocd = no good combination.
[2016/01/23 19:25:52] <Karkus> sysesthesia? Is that associating numbers with colours?
[2016/01/23 19:26:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: Exactly.
[2016/01/23 19:26:43] <Karkus> I guess more useful would be associating numbers with their prime factors
[2016/01/23 19:27:14] <Tobbi> Karkus: :D Daniel Tammet might be able to do that.
[2016/01/23 19:27:47] <Karkus> Looking him up, I recognise him.
[2016/01/23 19:28:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: I think I watched a documentry about him
[2016/01/23 19:29:01] <Tobbi> I started reading a book about him.
[2016/01/23 19:30:24] <Tobbi> I didn't actually finish it, though.
