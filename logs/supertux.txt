[2016/02/01 06:12:39] <snadge> i know this is offtopic.. but i just installed extreme tuxracer
[2016/02/01 06:12:51] <Tobbi> snadge: ...and?
[2016/02/01 06:13:01] <snadge> i cant help but feel that it sucks
[2016/02/01 06:13:07] <snadge> lol
[2016/02/01 06:13:23] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/01 06:13:30] <snadge> i've got hours of longevity out of supertux
[2016/02/01 06:13:45] <Tobbi> Oh, 0.7.0 was just release.
[2016/02/01 06:13:48] <Tobbi> d
[2016/02/01 06:13:50] <snadge> its challenging.. fun.. frustrating.. all of these things.. the contributed stuff can be very clever / creative
[2016/02/01 06:13:51] <Tobbi> of extreme tux racer.
[2016/02/01 06:14:09] <snadge> but extreme tux racer.. hmm.. i cant help but feel the mechanics of that game sucks
[2016/02/01 06:14:18] <snadge> and initial impressions are.. there is nothing fun about it
[2016/02/01 06:14:26] <Tobbi> :P Okay, I do get it...
[2016/02/01 06:14:35] <Tobbi> snadge: But SuperTux and the racer are completely different games.
[2016/02/01 06:14:51] <snadge> yeah.. i think i need to see a guide to etracer to see if im playing it wrong or something
[2016/02/01 06:14:56] <snadge> but i just find it very dorky to control
[2016/02/01 06:15:12] <Tobbi> snadge: I think that's the game, really. Last time I tried it was like that as well.
[2016/02/01 06:19:02] <Tobbi> Maybe I should contribute to that instead.
[2016/02/01 06:19:07] <Tobbi> It needs more work than we do.
[2016/02/01 06:19:56] <snadge> a 3d supertux would be better imho
[2016/02/01 06:20:09] <Tobbi> snadge: There is one...Supertux 3D on sourceforge.
[2016/02/01 06:20:09] <snadge> kinda like the 3d mario on the nintendo ds

[2016/02/01 12:05:10] <brmbrmcar> What happened to Notifico?
[2016/02/01 12:05:17] <mt> it's been replaced

[2016/02/01 12:09:40] <mt> what's wrong with it?
[2016/02/01 12:09:50] <brmbrmcar> I just don't like it.
[2016/02/01 12:10:02] <mt> there has to be a reason for that
[2016/02/01 12:10:04] <brmbrmcar> It sounds and looks awful.
[2016/02/01 12:10:18] <brmbrmcar> It relies on indentation.
[2016/02/01 12:10:50] <mt> proper indentation > everything else :D
[2016/02/01 12:11:00] <mt> >it looks awful
[2016/02/01 12:11:06] <mt> have you seen decorators
[2016/02/01 12:11:07] <brmbrmcar> Yes, butit shouldn't affect code.
[2016/02/01 12:11:35] <mt> it should, because improper indentation will sooner or later lead to a bug because developers won't understand their code
[2016/02/01 12:12:20] <brmbrmcar> I often change indentation to what seems best.
[2016/02/01 12:13:04] <mt> 4 characters wide, spaces; what Python uses and what is best for everything
[2016/02/01 12:14:48] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I suggest to you: Brainfuck.
[2016/02/01 12:14:50] <Tobbi> It*s nice.

[2016/02/01 15:20:02] <Hume2> I hate those double letters :P
[2016/02/01 15:21:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: Because, unintuitive in Czech?
[2016/02/01 15:21:32] <Hume2> There are double letters ecen in Czech, but for some reason.
[2016/02/01 15:22:45] <Hume2> It's only when a sufix ends on the same letter as the root begins or similar situations.
[2016/02/01 15:23:01] <brmbrmcar> Sufix?
[2016/02/01 15:23:03] <brmbrmcar> LOL
[2016/02/01 15:23:10] <Hume2> Prefix
[2016/02/01 15:23:20] <Hume2> My mistake.
[2016/02/01 15:23:31] <brmbrmcar> No,the spelling of sufix.
[2016/02/01 15:24:00] <Hume2> How is it then? Suffix?
[2016/02/01 15:24:30] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/01 15:24:37] <brmbrmcar> I think.
[2016/02/01 15:25:15] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/01 15:26:22] <Hume2> Can this be a [ci skip]? I'm not sure.
[2016/02/01 15:26:29] <brmbrmcar> Wht be?
[2016/02/01 15:26:49] <Hume2> That grammar and formating fix.
[2016/02/01 15:27:06] <brmbrmcar> Is it in /src?
[2016/02/01 15:27:26] <Hume2> Yes, it is.
[2016/02/01 15:27:31] <brmbrmcar> I'd be onthe safe side.
[2016/02/01 15:28:13] <Hume2> I think so. Eventually the next build will test it.
[2016/02/01 15:29:22] <Tobbi> Hume2: It can. Just make sure it compiles locally.
[2016/02/01 15:30:15] <Tobbi> It can be expected that whatever compiled before will also compile afterwards.

[2016/02/02 06:29:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: By the way: If a member function calls the exact same member function of the base class, it is obsolete, isn't it?
[2016/02/02 06:36:25] <Hume2> Tobbi: Indeed, it is.
[2016/02/02 06:36:43] <Tobbi> Hume2: Let me look through the code for any occurrences...
[2016/02/02 06:41:27] <Tobbi> Hume2: I wonder whether we should have a const version of the collision_* functions...
[2016/02/02 06:41:59] <Hume2> Tobbi: It has something to do with the objects.
[2016/02/02 06:42:18] <Hume2> For example there the on_ground flag is updated.
[2016/02/02 06:43:14] <Hume2> The const is only for functions those don't modify the object variables, right?
[2016/02/02 06:43:20] <Tobbi> Hume2: Exactly.
[2016/02/02 06:43:35] <Hume2> So they can't be const, I think.
[2016/02/02 06:44:04] <Tobbi> Hume2: If they only return FORCE_MOVE; they can.
[2016/02/02 06:44:10] <Tobbi> (some do that)
[2016/02/02 06:44:45] <Hume2> Yes, but is that possible, even when the function in the parent calss isn't const?
[2016/02/02 06:46:18] <Tobbi> Hume2: You know that you can have "collision_solid()" and "collision_solid() const" both in the same class.
[2016/02/02 06:46:51] <Tobbi> Oh, wait!
[2016/02/02 06:46:53] <Tobbi> Can we?
[2016/02/02 06:46:56] <Tobbi> I don't know.
[2016/02/02 06:53:23] <Tobbi> Hume2: What do we do about this scripting interface thing...?
[2016/02/02 06:53:33] <Tobbi> Scripting interface is not safe from memory access violations.
[2016/02/02 06:53:45] <Hume2> Hmmm...
[2016/02/02 06:54:00] <Tobbi> I kind of have an idea...
[2016/02/02 06:54:04] <Tobbi> But I need to think this through.
[2016/02/02 06:54:37] <Tobbi> Hume2: We need to change create_wrapper.cpp and add NULL checks.
[2016/02/02 06:54:49] <Hume2> I'll look
[2016/02/02 06:57:12] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2016/02/02 06:57:14] <Tobbi> I got it.
[2016/02/02 07:06:06] <Tobbi> I probably fixed it.

[2016/02/02 10:09:53] <Tobbi> I think this might be easier than using the text file approach.
[2016/02/02 10:10:03] <sydney_untangle> Hrm.
[2016/02/02 10:10:09] <sydney_untangle> Well, you can do it. :)
[2016/02/02 10:10:29] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: If I had a spare SD card, I could do it on my rbpi-
[2016/02/02 10:10:32] <Tobbi> But I don't have one.
[2016/02/02 10:10:45] <Tobbi> I could technically shutdown my rbpi, dump the sd card contents to my HDD...and then try it.
[2016/02/02 10:10:59] <Tobbi> But that wouldn't be a permanent solution.
[2016/02/02 10:11:39] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I just don't want something uploading to github constantly.
[2016/02/02 10:11:45] <sydney_untangle> 5 mins it more often than i like.
[2016/02/02 10:11:58] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Hrm...you're right. It's actually not that much of a good solution.
[2016/02/02 10:12:08] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: So, there we know what you can send me: A rbpi.
[2016/02/02 10:12:11] <Tobbi> (a second one)
[2016/02/02 10:12:13] <Tobbi> With SD card...
[2016/02/02 10:12:20] <sydney_untangle> Hehe.
[2016/02/02 10:12:32] <Tobbi> Currently, mine runs openelec.
[2016/02/02 10:12:38] <Tobbi> Although I don't use that very often.
[2016/02/02 10:12:41] <sydney_untangle> I dont have one myself, so why would i get you a second one? :p
[2016/02/02 10:13:05] <sydney_untangle> I have a beast of an old desktop that you can have if you will pay shipping. :D
[2016/02/02 10:13:21] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Sorry, have that myself. What does your logger run on?
[2016/02/02 10:13:38] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Another beast of an old desktop. ;)
[2016/02/02 10:13:43] <Tobbi> I see...
[2016/02/02 10:13:57] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: rbpi would probably be less resource-wasting...
[2016/02/02 10:14:04] <sydney_untangle> Not the nicest to the electric bill... but...
[2016/02/02 10:14:08] <sydney_untangle> Meh. :p
[2016/02/02 10:14:21] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: But i cannot hook 4 HDDs to a RPI.
[2016/02/02 10:14:39] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Why would you want to do that, anyway?
[2016/02/02 10:14:48] <Tobbi> Also, you can, if the power supply is strong enough, I guess.
[2016/02/02 10:14:54] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I use my server for backups and such.
[2016/02/02 10:14:57] <Tobbi> I see...
