[2015/11/06 11:42:45] <brmbrmcar> There is no advanced HTML needed.
[2015/11/06 11:43:10] <head8debian> Karkus: its hacked together. i have crontab execute a cp command, then i have it execute a git commit and push command and i have a ssh key set up between github and my server.
[2015/11/06 11:43:23] <head8debian> Karkus: Currently it only gets dumped to 1 file.
[2015/11/06 11:43:32] <head8debian> And my website is thrown together...

[2015/11/06 11:44:55] <head8debian> I could do more...
[2015/11/06 11:46:05] <head8debian> There, now its 5 times a day... that should be better.
[2015/11/06 11:46:12] <head8debian> I really don't want to do more than that.

[2015/11/06 12:15:31] <maths22> I'm working on importing my logs from irssi, and then I will try to make a better front-end

[2015/11/06 12:16:23] <maths22> Karkus: not sure, but the really nice thing about it is that, once I finish making my script, it will be really easy to import logs from irrsi if the logserver goes down

[2015/11/06 17:02:05] <leyyin> btw, I used the travis file from supertux for the stk-editor ;)
[2015/11/06 17:02:12] <leyyin> without proper reference
[2015/11/06 17:02:18] <leyyin> you could say I stole it :P

[2015/11/06 17:05:30] <Karkus> Sorry
[2015/11/06 17:05:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's alright. I am not mean.
[2015/11/06 17:05:36] <Tobbi> I am evil.
[2015/11/06 17:06:00] <leyyin> Tobbi, if you are evil then I am Stalin
[2015/11/06 17:06:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: I think you should stick to torturing babies
[2015/11/06 17:06:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, yeah, we need to devise a new method...
[2015/11/06 17:06:26] <Karkus> Okay that has no context
[2015/11/06 17:06:28] <Tobbi> What about those wind turbines...

[2015/11/06 17:06:35] <Tobbi> We could couple them with cherry cake.

[2015/11/06 17:07:23] <Tobbi> leyyin: We never talked about literally torturing babies.
[2015/11/06 17:07:34] <leyyin> you live in Germany man
[2015/11/06 17:07:40] <Tobbi> And, for the most part, no one of us has ever tortured a baby.
[2015/11/06 17:07:49] <leyyin> they arrest you just for wearing an indian sign ;)
[2015/11/06 17:07:57] <red_bot> Tobbi: sure... your talking about putting 1 baby in 3 trach cans...
[2015/11/06 17:07:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: Speak for yourself :D
[2015/11/06 17:07:58] <Tobbi> leyyin: *cough*
[2015/11/06 17:08:06] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/11/06 17:08:14] <red_bot> Tobbi: According to my perfect logs...
[2015/11/06 17:08:24] <Tobbi> That's the exception. If you believe in Buddhism, it's not actually killing if the baby gets reborn.
[2015/11/06 17:08:38] <Karkus> There are advantages to not having logs too, I guess
[2015/11/06 17:08:42] <Tobbi> Wait, Buddhism, Hinduism, right?
[2015/11/06 17:08:53] <head8debian> Karkus: Haha, true.

[2015/11/06 17:26:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh c'mon...

[2015/11/06 17:33:12] <brmbrmcar> It is the United Kingdom!

[2015/11/06 17:35:08] <brmbrmcar> Why?
[2015/11/06 17:35:43] <Karkus> Why what?
[2015/11/06 17:36:07] <brmbrmcar> Do you not want NI or Wales?
[2015/11/06 17:36:43] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Where do you live?

[2015/11/06 17:37:21] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/06 17:37:26] <Karkus> and Wales, well idk I can't understand them

[2015/11/06 18:01:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: It was speculated a while ago that swimming could be implemented in supertux. Could that be a 0.5.0 thing or is it not possible due the amount of levels that rely on you being unable to swim?
[2015/11/06 18:01:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could certainly put it in the 0.5.0 release list.
[2015/11/06 18:01:39] <Tobbi> eeh, todo list.
[2015/11/06 18:01:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Which is where?
[2015/11/06 18:01:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: not yet created.
[2015/11/06 18:02:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: file a bug report.

[2015/11/06 18:02:15] <Karkus> okay
[2015/11/06 18:02:29] <Tobbi> We'd have to go through the list of levels to see which of these use water...

[2015/11/06 18:04:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe a lot of levels require you to be unable to swim... But maybe we could add a special bonus item.

[2015/11/06 18:13:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: that would be cool. :D What kind of item do you think should give tux the ability to swim?
[2015/11/06 18:13:52] <Tobbi> Because otherwise, we'd have to rework a lot of levels.
[2015/11/06 18:14:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: Flippers would be a kinda funny one
[2015/11/06 18:14:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Penguins are pretty epic at swimming anyway :P
[2015/11/06 18:14:34] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/11/06 18:15:13] <Tobbi> oh, wait. Water has never really been solid.
[2015/11/06 18:15:26] <Tobbi> So, we don't need a special item for tht
[2015/11/06 18:15:27] <Tobbi> that
[2015/11/06 18:15:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: How about this for music: https://soundcloud.com/karkus476/water-theme? Please be honest if it's bad. it's a proof of concept unfinished thing
[2015/11/06 18:16:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: we do, as many levels have water that, if you could swim in it, would make the level easy
[2015/11/06 18:16:29] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2015/11/06 18:16:33] <Tobbi> hah, confusion.
[2015/11/06 18:16:41] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, that theme plays when Tux swims?
[2015/11/06 18:16:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, in underwater levels
[2015/11/06 18:16:59] <Tobbi> Ah...
[2015/11/06 18:17:03] <Tobbi> Hmm, interesting.
[2015/11/06 18:17:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: In my opinion, it needs a more mysterious touch.
[2015/11/06 18:17:37] <Tobbi> Or?
[2015/11/06 18:17:39] <Tobbi> Let me check something.
[2015/11/06 18:17:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah, I see.
[2015/11/06 18:20:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Check what?

[2015/11/06 18:20:30] <Tobbi> Do you know Fish Fillets - Next Generation.
[2015/11/06 18:20:33] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/11/06 18:20:42] <Tobbi> The music doesn't fit well, either.
[2015/11/06 18:21:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't know it
[2015/11/06 18:21:27] <Tobbi> okay.
[2015/11/06 18:21:41] <Karkus> And which music doesn't fit well?
[2015/11/06 18:21:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: The one I linked to, above.
[2015/11/06 18:21:59] <Karkus> Oh, okay
[2015/11/06 18:22:18] <Tobbi> We need something funky, but something that is mysterious at the same time, and "underwater". :P
[2015/11/06 18:22:50] <Tobbi> On the other hand.
[2015/11/06 18:22:56] <Karkus> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xelag0YVrcs
[2015/11/06 18:22:59] <Tobbi> I just checked mario's underwater theme...
[2015/11/06 18:23:05] <Karkus> Ah
[2015/11/06 18:23:43] <Tobbi> Okay, so maybe I was too strict there :D
[2015/11/06 18:24:23] <Karkus> I get what you mean.
[2015/11/06 18:24:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could have music blocks... Things that play a certain note when you hit them :D
[2015/11/06 18:24:55] <Tobbi> And people could play around with that then :D
[2015/11/06 18:25:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: But we need a good editor :P
[2015/11/06 18:25:20] <Tobbi> *sigh* yeah, you're right :D
[2015/11/06 18:25:21] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/11/06 18:25:27] <Tobbi> That prerequisite...
[2015/11/06 18:25:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Add it to the list
[2015/11/06 18:25:42] <Tobbi> Not sure if I should or how much fun that would be :D
[2015/11/06 18:26:48] <Karkus> Tobbi: Once I've done this controls thing I'll see what I can do for the editor.
[2015/11/06 18:26:56] <Tobbi> Alright, thanks
[2015/11/06 18:26:57] <Tobbi> !
[2015/11/06 18:27:14] <Karkus> I wish Grumbel had just commented his code in the first place
[2015/11/06 18:27:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do many OS projects have documentation?
[2015/11/06 18:28:10] <Tobbi> Hmm, that's a thing I don't know. I don't normally follow that many open source projects.
[2015/11/06 18:28:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/06 18:28:26] <Karkus> I doubt it though
[2015/11/06 18:30:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: on the other hand, levels based on music will likely be hard for the hearing impaired.
[2015/11/06 18:30:26] <Tobbi> So maybe we shouldn't develop that idea further...
[2015/11/06 18:31:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: We should have a braile version of the wiki
[2015/11/06 18:31:32] <Karkus> jk :D
[2015/11/06 18:31:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: We could have subtitles
[2015/11/06 18:31:49] <Karkus> If you *really* want
[2015/11/06 18:32:04] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:32:08] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2015/11/06 18:32:23] <Tobbi> How would a music level actually look like anyway?
[2015/11/06 18:32:24] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:33:00] <Tobbi> But, yeah, braille...
[2015/11/06 18:33:01] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:33:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: But, yeah, braille, no :P
[2015/11/06 18:33:47] <datahead8888> A music based level would probably have differet notes or snippets of music play at different points that cue the player in to actions.  For visual look you could have staffs and/or notes.
[2015/11/06 18:34:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: What program did you use to compose the music?
[2015/11/06 18:34:13] <datahead8888> For the hearing impaired you would have to have text that allows them to get the hints without auditory cues.
[2015/11/06 18:34:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: Musescore
[2015/11/06 18:34:24] <Tobbi> Sounds interesting.
[2015/11/06 18:34:49] <datahead8888> Now, programming levels for the blind would be interesting.  You would need auditory cues that allow them to play in a "dark level" so as to speak
[2015/11/06 18:34:53] <Karkus> You can probably already script sounds in anyway
[2015/11/06 18:35:13] <Karkus> Echo location supertux, anyone?
[2015/11/06 18:35:21] <datahead8888> Oh, that's a good idea
[2015/11/06 18:35:32] <datahead8888> It would make an interesting challenge for people who see, too
[2015/11/06 18:35:47] <datahead8888> It would probably have to be a slow moving level
[2015/11/06 18:36:04] <datahead8888> You wouldn't want enemies that move fast and dive bomb the player in something like that :)
[2015/11/06 18:36:16] <Tobbi> Create issues, guys.
[2015/11/06 18:36:17] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:36:19] <Karkus> datahead8888: A pit would be hard enough
[2015/11/06 18:36:29] <Tobbi> Interesting thing for post 0.4.0
[2015/11/06 18:36:45] <Karkus> Everything is interesting when it's post 0.4.0 :D
[2015/11/06 18:36:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:37:19] <datahead8888> I've suggested some of this kind of stuff for Secret Chronicles before - it's all a matter of priorities
[2015/11/06 18:37:24] <datahead8888> But if you want, I could file some issues
[2015/11/06 18:38:27] <datahead8888> While you're at it, it's good to think about disability accessibility for the whole game
[2015/11/06 18:38:32] <datahead8888> What if you have a color blind player?
[2015/11/06 18:38:54] <datahead8888> Or have tones in other parts of the game
[2015/11/06 18:39:22] <Tobbi> But it's hard for colour blind people, anyway.
[2015/11/06 18:39:28] <Tobbi> Unless we filter everything in specific colours/
[2015/11/06 18:39:46] <datahead8888> Well, you'd probably focus on critical items they have to differentiate.
[2015/11/06 18:40:12] <datahead8888> It might be a bit challenging to do unless you can find a color blind volunteer to check out the game
[2015/11/06 18:42:45] <Karkus> datahead8debian: Colour blindness does not affect people that much
[2015/11/06 18:43:09] <Karkus> It's not like black and white, and supertux doesn't need colours to fucntion
[2015/11/06 18:44:00] <datahead8888> If you had text without good contrast it could become an issue
[2015/11/06 18:45:13] <Karkus> datahead8888: I guess. Maybe.
[2015/11/06 18:45:29] <datahead8888> It might not be an issue at all now, though

[2015/11/07 10:21:28] <head8debian> I don't have my nose up to my screen, so why do i need a better screen?
[2015/11/07 10:21:38] <leyyin> higher dpi
[2015/11/07 10:22:31] <Hume2> What do they expect? I don't want to see what's on my computer via a microscope.
[2015/11/07 10:22:45] <head8debian> What i have works fine.
[2015/11/07 10:22:48] <leyyin> you can see the diference man ;)
[2015/11/07 10:22:54] <leyyin> higher quality
[2015/11/07 10:22:58] <leyyin> more sharp
[2015/11/07 10:23:00] <head8debian> Yes i can, ive seen a 4k screen.
[2015/11/07 10:23:05] <leyyin> it's like looking out of a window
[2015/11/07 10:23:09] <head8debian> But my wallet cringes. :D
[2015/11/07 10:23:18] <head8debian> And i only get new when my old breaks.
[2015/11/07 10:23:34] <leyyin> or get new, and keep both :P

[2015/11/07 10:24:11] <head8debian> Hey, im still using a 15in 1024x768px screen. :)
[2015/11/07 10:24:29] <leyyin> that is a weird resolution
[2015/11/07 10:24:36] <Hume2> I'm using 1536×768 screen.
[2015/11/07 10:24:48] <leyyin> are you sure it is not 1366? Hume2
[2015/11/07 10:25:03] <head8debian> My main screen is 1600x900.
[2015/11/07 10:25:22] <Hume2> leyyin: Yes, that's right.
[2015/11/07 10:25:28] <Hume2> leyyin: 1366
[2015/11/07 10:25:35] <Hume2> it is.
[2015/11/07 10:25:42] <head8debian> Only 11954 hours on it. :D
[2015/11/07 10:25:56] <leyyin> how can you tell? head8debian
[2015/11/07 10:26:14] <head8debian> My screen has a menu which tells me...
[2015/11/07 10:26:18] <leyyin> 498 days

[2015/11/07 10:26:42] <leyyin> what?
[2015/11/07 10:26:50] <leyyin> what crappy tractors do you have?
[2015/11/07 10:26:57] <leyyin> I have seen tractors old as 40 years
[2015/11/07 10:26:59] <leyyin> still running
[2015/11/07 10:27:07] <head8debian> Only 40? :)
[2015/11/07 10:27:40] <head8debian> My grandpa has one from when he was 12 thats still running. :) And he is 80.
[2015/11/07 10:27:42] <leyyin> how can a tractor not run for 498 days?
[2015/11/07 10:28:08] <head8debian> Tractors don't go by the amount of miles on them, they go by hours on them.
[2015/11/07 10:28:27] <leyyin> what?
[2015/11/07 10:28:27] <head8debian> 6,000 hours on a Combine is alot.
[2015/11/07 10:28:41] <leyyin> how do they measure that?
[2015/11/07 10:29:02] <head8debian> We have a Skytrak with 12,000 hours and its its startign to show its age.
[2015/11/07 10:29:11] <head8debian> leyyin: Every tractor has a time meter...
[2015/11/07 10:29:19] <head8debian> Well, newer ones...
[2015/11/07 10:29:24] <leyyin> I do not think I saw that kind of thing here tbh
[2015/11/07 10:29:27] <head8debian> after 1980. ;)
[2015/11/07 10:30:02] <head8debian> We run relatively modern equipment because of reliabilty reasons and size.
[2015/11/07 10:30:21] <head8debian> Mdern as within the last 20 years.
[2015/11/07 10:30:46] <head8debian> You cannot cover hundreds of acres with a old "put put". :)
[2015/11/07 10:31:04] <head8debian> Wait, your not in the USA, so you wouldn't understand that reference...
[2015/11/07 10:31:16] <head8debian> leyyin: Whats the most popular tractor over ther?
[2015/11/07 10:31:20] <head8debian> there*
[2015/11/07 10:32:17] <mt> The average european is probably not interested in the popularity of tractors...

[2015/11/07 14:22:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: What kind of sponsor do you mean?
[2015/11/07 14:22:49] <Tobbi> Karkus, a VPS, probably? Something we can do automatic nightly builds on.
[2015/11/07 14:23:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: But someone has to pay for it.
[2015/11/07 14:23:25] <Tobbi> Karkus, Not if the company finds the cause worthwhile.
[2015/11/07 14:23:26] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/07 14:23:30] <Karkus> Unless you mean get an actual sponsor of supertux
[2015/11/07 14:23:39] <Tobbi> I mean: We're an open-source projects, we should be able to get someone to pay for the server.
[2015/11/07 14:23:40] <Tobbi> right?
[2015/11/07 14:24:49] <Tobbi> That's something we could need donations for.
[2015/11/07 14:25:19] <mt> With cross-compiling we could also try to get sponsors for this https://www.scaleway.com/pricing/ (don't forget VAT in EU)
[2015/11/07 14:26:58] <Tobbi> mt, Can you ask around?
[2015/11/07 14:27:12] <mt> Not sure who to ask, tbh
[2015/11/07 14:27:28] <Tobbi> mt, I mean: Ask around whether they'd let us set that up for free? We'd of course link back to them from supertux.github.io
[2015/11/07 14:27:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: You could use my server. :D
[2015/11/07 14:27:33] <Tobbi> Could give them some recognition.
[2015/11/07 14:27:38] <Tobbi> head8debian, For cross-compiling?
[2015/11/07 14:27:41] <Tobbi> head8debian, How good is it?
[2015/11/07 14:27:49] <head8debian> Well, not real good.
[2015/11/07 14:27:55] <head8debian> dual core 2.2ghz IIRC.
[2015/11/07 14:28:11] <Tobbi> head8debian, Problem is uploading stuff with your bandwidth.
[2015/11/07 14:28:15] <Tobbi> I believe.
[2015/11/07 14:28:16] <Tobbi> Right?
[2015/11/07 14:28:30] <mt> You'd not need cross-compilation on x86_64 machines, that server I linked to needs it because it's ARM
[2015/11/07 14:28:38] <head8debian> It would take a few mins.
[2015/11/07 14:29:03] <mt> Also, Online SAS is a rather big company, I'd expect more support from smaller hosting companies
[2015/11/07 14:29:09] <head8debian> But i don't care so much about upload speeds. Down is more annoying.

[2015/11/07 14:30:37] <head8debian> It does have 2gb ram.
[2015/11/07 14:30:47] <mt> Because that server's cheaper; you can cross-compile
[2015/11/07 14:31:28] <head8debian> Im not sure if it has ECC ram or non ECC ram.
[2015/11/07 14:31:28] <mt> You know that cross-compiling is for compiling code on an architecture different from the target architecture.
[2015/11/07 14:31:38] <head8debian> Yes i do...
[2015/11/07 14:32:08] <head8debian> But why do we need to cross compile?
[2015/11/07 14:32:20] <Tobbi> So that people from other OSes can get nightly builds as well?
[2015/11/07 14:32:26] <Tobbi> *using other OSes
[2015/11/07 14:32:38] <head8debian> Well, i could see 32 bit and 64 bit, but say x64-86 to ARM?
[2015/11/07 14:32:49] <mt> Nah, because if we'd build natively for ARM no-one could run the builds
[2015/11/07 14:33:22] <mt> If we cross-compile on ARM for x86_64 and i686, then you could run the binaries on "normal" computers
[2015/11/07 14:33:27] <head8debian> I could handle a couple uploads, but not more than 500mb a night.
[2015/11/07 14:34:11] <mt> Also, head8debian, why do you care about ECC? Even most x86_64 basic-level dedicated servers don't have ECC RAM.
[2015/11/07 14:34:31] <Tobbi> head8debian, The binaries shouldn't exceed 500 MB
[2015/11/07 14:34:37] <Tobbi> Maybe 250 in total or something.
[2015/11/07 14:34:39] <head8debian> Because, i could upgrade the ram if its non ECC. ;)
[2015/11/07 14:34:52] <head8debian> I haven't done any looking into the ram it has atm...
[2015/11/07 14:35:07] <head8debian> I got a mobo-cpu-ram combo and just instaleld it and started using it.
[2015/11/07 14:35:18] <mt> That server I linked to is using an ARM SoC, you can't replace RAM on SoCs.
[2015/11/07 14:35:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: But do we really *need* nightly builds?
[2015/11/07 14:35:32] <head8debian> mt: I do know what a SOC is. :)
[2015/11/07 14:35:45] <Tobbi> head8debian, No, we don't. But weekly builds could be neat.
[2015/11/07 14:36:03] <mt> head8debian: Yet you can't send them your RAM to add it.
[2015/11/07 14:36:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: But what if our development goes dead after M2 is released? :)
[2015/11/07 14:36:24] <head8debian> mt: True...
[2015/11/07 14:36:32] <head8debian> But 2gb ram can do quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:36:38] <head8debian> Not alot, but quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:36:57] <mt> As I said, I can build packaged x86_64 Arch Linux binaries manually once every week.
[2015/11/07 14:36:59] <Tobbi> head8debian, It certainly will.
[2015/11/07 14:37:21] <Tobbi> mt, Can't you cross-compile?
[2015/11/07 14:37:37] <head8debian> mt: I can to. :)
[2015/11/07 14:37:41] <mt> Cross-compile for what
[2015/11/07 14:37:47] <head8debian> mt: Arch packages are easy.
[2015/11/07 14:37:51] <Tobbi> mt, Cross-compile for win32 at least?
[2015/11/07 14:38:08] <Tobbi> Mac might be a problem.
[2015/11/07 14:38:09] <mt> Do we even support building using MinGW?
[2015/11/07 14:38:17] <head8debian> mt: I flagged the Supertux AUR package out of date, but haven't heard back. I even linked them to a updated version of it.
[2015/11/07 14:38:18] <Tobbi> afaik, we do.
[2015/11/07 14:38:55] <head8debian> Well, i would have more ram free if red_bot wasn't taking 250mb. o_O
[2015/11/07 14:38:58] <Tobbi> http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Building_on_Windows says we do with MSYS and MinGW
[2015/11/07 14:39:01] * head8debian stares at red_bot...
[2015/11/07 14:39:11] <Tobbi> red_bot stares back and wonders...
[2015/11/07 14:39:16] <Tobbi> Okay, guys, see you later.
[2015/11/07 14:39:21] <Tobbi> or rather in a minute.

[2015/11/07 14:39:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: The only thing with building is that my CPU fan is noisy. :D
[2015/11/07 14:40:22] <mt> I know that, I have so many computers I could use as homeservers, but they're too noisy

[2015/11/07 14:41:51] <Tobbi_> This project's activity has gone up quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:42:43] <head8debian> mt: my server is the last computer i use currently thats noisy, thankfully. ;)
[2015/11/07 14:43:08] <mt> but: more activity -> more bugs -> more activity -> even more bugs -> /* repeat */ :(
[2015/11/07 14:43:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, i do have another computer that we could use for this... but i don't want to. Then my room would be super really noisy. :p
[2015/11/07 14:43:40] <head8debian> mt: True... but you cannot just live with bugs.
[2015/11/07 14:43:46] <Karkus> mt: But more people to fix bugs

[2015/11/07 14:44:21] <head8debian> Its a loop...
[2015/11/07 14:44:24] <Tobbi> but also resulting in the project being sustainable.
[2015/11/07 14:44:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: How've you got two unaffiliated quotes
[2015/11/07 14:44:26] <mt> and to introduce as well
[2015/11/07 14:44:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: Uh?
[2015/11/07 14:44:46] <Karkus> Tobbi: Tobbi_ is unaffiliated
[2015/11/07 14:44:52] <Karkus> OOps
[2015/11/07 14:44:53] <Tobbi> mt: Doesn't every big open source project have that problem?
[2015/11/07 14:44:54] <Karkus> cloaks
[2015/11/07 14:44:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: yup.
[2015/11/07 14:45:01] <Karkus> not quotes
[2015/11/07 14:45:03] <mt> Karkus: if you're talking about cloaks, they will always be set when you identify
[2015/11/07 14:45:10] <mt> regardless of the nicknames
[2015/11/07 14:45:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: I have no clue how i'd set up my server to build packages like that though... the upload wouldn't be so hard. My server runs debian btw.
[2015/11/07 14:45:38] <Karkus> mt: But you need to get a cloak for each one, and an account for each one
[2015/11/07 14:45:42] <mt> Tobbi: I guess not just every big open source project, every bigger software project
[2015/11/07 14:45:51] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/11/07 14:45:52] <head8debian> Karkus: No, you group the nicks to your account.
[2015/11/07 14:45:57] <mt> Karkus: nope, you can sign in to the same account multiple times
[2015/11/07 14:46:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: Cronjob?
[2015/11/07 14:46:06] <mt> You don't even need to group nicks
[2015/11/07 14:46:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: Of course cronjob, but like to make a .deb file. ive heard they are a PITB.
[2015/11/07 14:46:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: You mean PITA? Yummy.

[2015/11/07 14:47:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: What OSes would i have to build for?
[2015/11/07 14:47:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Linux and maybe Windows. I believe, OS X is too hard to do.
[2015/11/07 14:47:53] <Karkus> head8debian: Solaris only
[2015/11/07 14:47:58] <Karkus> :D
[2015/11/07 14:48:01] <Tobbi> Solaris? urgh
[2015/11/07 14:48:10] <Karkus> I'm just kidding
[2015/11/07 14:48:19] <head8debian> mt: *should* a debian .deb work with ubuntu if its made properly?
[2015/11/07 14:48:23] <head8debian> Karkus: o_O
[2015/11/07 14:48:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: You'd have to transpile supertux into Java and create one JAR
[2015/11/07 14:48:33] <head8debian> I hate java...
[2015/11/07 14:48:37] <Karkus> head8debian: They do
[2015/11/07 14:48:42] <Tobbi> Java hates you as well.
[2015/11/07 14:48:50] <mt> Solaris, killall python :D
[2015/11/07 14:48:56] <head8debian> I use it as little as possible...
[2015/11/07 14:49:10] <Karkus> I used to like the language Java
[2015/11/07 14:49:22] <Karkus> But it's incredibly frustrating
[2015/11/07 14:49:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: careful...my bachelor thesis program is written in Java.
[2015/11/07 14:49:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: How in the world do you make a windows executable? o_O
[2015/11/07 14:49:45] <Karkus> Correction - I love Java it's the best
[2015/11/07 14:49:49] <mt> head8debian: it might work, but even a proper deb package might not work as ubuntu is not binary compatible to debian
[2015/11/07 14:50:02] <head8debian> I don't even know how to compile 32 bit on 64 bit...
[2015/11/07 14:50:05] <Karkus> head8debian: It's a mystery to everyone
[2015/11/07 14:50:13] <head8debian> lol. :-)
[2015/11/07 14:50:49] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:50:54] <mt> same applies to debian releases, e.g. squeeze, wheezy, jessie and sid, as they use different library versions, which will just break (and yes, I'm adding squeeze to the list because it's still supported)
[2015/11/07 14:51:19] <head8debian> mt: Dont forget stretch... ;)
[2015/11/07 14:51:33] <mt> I don't like testing
[2015/11/07 14:51:50] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/07 14:51:51] <leyyin> Tobbi, I write my bachelor thesis in ocaml ;)

[2015/11/07 14:52:29] <leyyin> secret :P
[2015/11/07 14:52:42] @ Quit: darkbasic: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2015/11/07 14:52:52] <leyyin> conversion from some diagrams to a session logic format, so that it easy to generate code
[2015/11/07 14:53:06] <mt> head8debian: Because it doesn't really get security updates - (old(old))stable gets fast security updates as patches; sid/unstable gets fast security updates from the latest release but testing will have to wait for the package to be in sid for some time and therefore won't get fast security updates
[2015/11/07 14:53:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: Sounds complicated.
[2015/11/07 14:53:27] <leyyin> sounds ;)
[2015/11/07 14:53:34] <Tobbi> hmm okay...
[2015/11/07 14:53:40] <leyyin> everything is simple once you know it :D
[2015/11/07 14:53:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: Believe me, writing a rudimentary transpiler was easy... :P
[2015/11/07 14:54:09] <leyyin> :D
[2015/11/07 14:54:10] <Tobbi> Still, it was torn apart by one of the profs.
[2015/11/07 14:54:11] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:54:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do you get to choose your language?
[2015/11/07 14:54:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: My prof wanted me to use...uh...yacc for that...
[2015/11/07 14:55:00] <leyyin> haha, yacc
[2015/11/07 14:55:02] <Tobbi> Karkus: But he told me something about "Compiler compiler" and I was freaked out.
[2015/11/07 14:55:09] <leyyin> or lex :P
[2015/11/07 14:55:17] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I was like: No way on earth am I gonna use a compiler compiler. I'm gonna write my own thing.
[2015/11/07 14:55:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: O_o
[2015/11/07 14:55:31] <Tobbi> It would've been easier using yacc, I believe.
[2015/11/07 14:55:46] <Tobbi> But, who cares :D
[2015/11/07 14:56:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: What did you use in the end though?
[2015/11/07 14:56:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: I wrote a transpiler in Java.
[2015/11/07 14:56:32] <Karkus> Oh, yeah
[2015/11/07 14:56:34] <Tobbi> That uses a stack and a map.

[2015/11/07 14:56:58] <leyyin> you should have used that ^
[2015/11/07 14:57:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: Uses too much memory.
[2015/11/07 14:57:11] <Tobbi> Also, it's too hairy.
[2015/11/07 14:57:12] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:57:17] <leyyin> I have my last homework for my compilers course to use lex or yacc
[2015/11/07 14:57:22] <Tobbi> I am not a yacc-ophile.

[2015/11/07 14:57:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 15:00:21] <mt> why don't you use bison if you don't like yacc?

[2015/11/07 19:14:05] <Karkus> Who is darkbasic and why do they always quit and join?
[2015/11/07 19:22:34] <head8debian> Karkus: Ask him...
[2015/11/07 19:22:36] <head8debian> ;)
[2015/11/07 19:23:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: one of them quits, the other joins, it's so easy.
[2015/11/07 19:23:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: But why
[2015/11/07 19:23:51] <Karkus> hehe
[2015/11/07 19:24:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: You know those moments when you don't know whether you want to enter a room or leave it and are stuck in the doorframe? This is no different.
[2015/11/07 19:25:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: Silently jumping back and forth through the doorframe...
[2015/11/07 19:25:40] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/11/07 19:26:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's the problem on the big channels like #freenode, so many join/part messages you have no option but to silence them

[2015/11/07 22:15:49] <datahead8888> Tobbi, did you want tickets for the music level or dark level with sound cues ideas?
[2015/11/07 22:16:08] <Tobbi> datahead8888: Yes, please. Whether we implement those is a different thing.
[2015/11/07 22:16:14] <Tobbi> Currently, I am busy with college..
[2015/11/07 22:16:16] <Tobbi> And it's 4am
[2015/11/07 22:16:43] <datahead8888> Okay, I thought you had suggested tickets earlier
[2015/11/07 22:17:10] <datahead8888> I just know that these may stay open for a while, and you guys usually seem to try to get tickets closed quickly, though maybe ‎I overperceived that
[2015/11/07 22:18:20] <Tobbi> No, it's exactly what we try to do.
[2015/11/07 22:18:32] <head8debian> Hey Tobbi.

[2015/11/08 12:18:51] <mt> please noo
[2015/11/08 12:19:07] <mt> try to make vector images
[2015/11/08 12:19:47] <mt> OS X, for example, uses 1024x1024 for HiDPI when 512x512 would be used
[2015/11/08 12:20:04] <brmbrmcar> But vector is bad...
[2015/11/08 12:20:57] <mt> Why is vector bad?
[2015/11/08 12:21:49] <brmbrmcar> Because it will only really be good within a certain size range.
[2015/11/08 12:21:52] <mt> It's smaller and can be scaled up without limit
[2015/11/08 12:22:05] <head8debian> mt: I do love vectors, but i would need to redo tux from scratch, which i wasnt planning on doing. the bitmap trace tool is still not very good.
[2015/11/08 12:22:25] <head8debian> Cannot .png do something similar?
[2015/11/08 12:22:37] <brmbrmcar> It is useful in enlarging, but should be modified heavily.
[2015/11/08 12:23:07] <mt> brmbrmcar: that's because vector graphics show exactly what you told them. If you don't include details it may look ugly when big.
[2015/11/08 12:23:40] <brmbrmcar> I k-now.
[2015/11/08 12:24:02] <brmbrmcar> I think we should just use the on in the repository.
[2015/11/08 12:24:14] <brmbrmcar> It's way better than any others.

[2015/11/08 12:28:30] <mt> head8debian: you can also try writing the svg in a text editor

[2015/11/08 13:42:42] <brmbrmcar> Use that.
[2015/11/08 13:42:50] <brmbrmcar> Trial it now.
[2015/11/08 13:43:04] <brmbrmcar> I can test it after.
[2015/11/08 14:13:27] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ping!!!!! PING@!
[2015/11/08 14:13:32] <Tobbi> calm down.
[2015/11/08 14:13:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: what?
[2015/11/08 14:13:55] <head8debian> PedroCosta: Feel free to ask Tobbi What you need answers to. :)
[2015/11/08 14:14:05] <brmbrmcar> CTCP PING reply from Tobbi: 0.531 seconds
[2015/11/08 14:14:12] <Tobbi> Stop it.
[2015/11/08 14:14:33] <brmbrmcar> Only did it once!
[2015/11/08 14:15:37] <PedroCosta> Will do!
[2015/11/08 14:15:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: He is talking to me in PM...
[2015/11/08 14:16:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: And he is going to try to talk to you now...
[2015/11/08 14:16:14] <Tobbi> gosh
[2015/11/08 14:17:00] <brmbrmcar> We all know how scary Tobbi is!
[2015/11/08 14:18:35] <PedroCosta> Trying to do a SuperTux deployment diagram, and wanted to know the kind of connection the PC establishes to get those. And what it connects to (is it a webserver) ?
[2015/11/08 14:18:42] <PedroCosta> the addons and maps
[2015/11/08 14:18:56] <Tobbi> PedroCosta: It's a github repository that gets queried.
[2015/11/08 14:19:08] <PedroCosta> Ah, I see!

[2015/11/09 11:51:22] <Karkus> I managed (by accident) to get a profile with a map messed up like this. But your commit doesn't fix it, it just stops it from occurring
[2015/11/09 11:51:26] <Karkus> Which is better

[2015/11/09 11:53:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, testing all paths leading to the current position might be the correct way, though that would be much more difficult.

[2015/11/09 12:03:22] <mt> I already described that in the issues tho
[2015/11/09 12:04:11] <mt> That library-version issue is also what can happen when you upgrade systems partially

[2015/11/09 12:18:52] <mt> what can be done to fix the version-related issue is versioning the library in the filename
[2015/11/09 12:18:55] <mt> like:
[2015/11/09 12:18:58] <mt> lrwxrwxrwx 1    24 Nov  2 23:28 /usr/lib/libavformat.so -> libavformat.so.56.40.101*
[2015/11/09 12:18:59] <Karkus> mt: But isn't there a better place that is more universal among the linux distros
[2015/11/09 12:19:00] <mt> lrwxrwxrwx 1    24 Nov  2 23:28 /usr/lib/libavformat.so.56 -> libavformat.so.56.40.101*

[2015/11/09 12:19:47] <mt> the right place would be /lib, but if the user says "install to prefix /a/b/c" then we shouldn't install something somewhere else

[2015/11/09 12:27:24] <Karkus> I'm thinking SuperTree
[2015/11/09 12:27:27] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/09 12:27:58] <Tobbi> SuperVelociraptor.

[2015/11/09 12:30:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: The changes I'm making in https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/184 are quickly becoming quite incompatible with the previous version. It's backwards compatible, but not foreward compatible
[2015/11/09 12:30:27] <Karkus> by which I mean it could screw people's configs

[2015/11/09 12:30:39] <Karkus> If they try to use an older version
[2015/11/09 12:30:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: You could always copy the file over if it exists in the old location?
[2015/11/09 12:30:51] <Tobbi> Or rather move it, don't kno.

[2015/11/09 12:31:20] <Tobbi> Okay, good!
[2015/11/09 12:31:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: but if someone decides they prefer 0.3.6 and go back, they'll lose their settings.
[2015/11/09 12:32:12] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2015/11/09 12:32:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, copying is not the same as moving, right?
[2015/11/09 12:32:34] <Tobbi> So, if you keep the old file...?
[2015/11/09 12:33:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Good idea. I'll use a 'profile' file to store the current profile.
[2015/11/09 12:33:45] <Tobbi> :-) alright
[2015/11/09 12:33:57] <Karkus> Then old 'config' can stick around
[2015/11/09 12:34:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: We just need to make sure that people don't mistakenly try to alter their old config.
[2015/11/09 12:36:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'll get it to add a comment warning that this is a 0.3.6 config file and is ignored by 0.4.0
[2015/11/09 12:36:37] <Tobbi> Sure! That sounds good. Hopefully it's not too complicated.

[2015/11/09 14:05:14] <Tobbi_> Karkus, It's alright... :P
[2015/11/09 14:05:27] <Tobbi_> Karkus, You know, sometimes I overload people with work, for the sake of doing it.

[2015/11/09 14:05:51] <Tobbi_> Karkus, I do. Because I am rather worried about people getting overworked.
[2015/11/09 14:06:04] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I'm not overworked
[2015/11/09 14:06:17] <Karkus> We have a deadline, and it needs meeting
[2015/11/09 14:06:22] <Tobbi_> Karkus, I know, but it can get that way too fast when you're getting overinvolved. :-)
[2015/11/09 14:06:34] <Tobbi_> I know that from my Mozilla contributor days.
[2015/11/09 14:06:43] <Karkus> I can add it to my new todo list http://swapoff.org/devtodo.html
[2015/11/09 14:06:46] <Tobbi_> But it's good that you'll take a break when you feel like it ;)

[2015/11/10 12:18:37] <Hume2> Hello, head8debian!
[2015/11/10 12:19:07] <Hume2> Someone should exterminate Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 12:19:48] <head8debian> Hume2: Nah, just windows.
[2015/11/10 12:20:08] <head8debian> Microsoft hasdone some cool things.
[2015/11/10 12:21:09] <Hume2> Just wait 70 years until the copyright laws will run out.
[2015/11/10 12:21:48] <Hume2> I read what Windows 10 everything does. I just feel a big rage.
[2015/11/10 12:21:48] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:21:53] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/10 12:22:03] <head8debian> Karkus: o_O
[2015/11/10 12:22:18] <Karkus> head8debian: What?
[2015/11/10 12:22:42] @ Quit: alket: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2015/11/10 12:23:00] <Hume2> When Windows10 spies all the computers, it should work vice-versa too.
[2015/11/10 12:23:34] <Karkus> head8debian:idk how we do the windows builds.
[2015/11/10 12:24:51] <head8debian> Karkus: Good question.
[2015/11/10 12:24:53] <head8debian> Hume2: :D
[2015/11/10 12:25:03] <Hume2> Karkus: Please don't. Windows is a spyware.
[2015/11/10 12:25:28] <head8debian> Windows is a pile of crud, but people use it, so we have to also.
[2015/11/10 12:25:41] <Hume2> No, we don't have to.
[2015/11/10 12:26:10] <Hume2> Yes, people are monkeys, even I am a monkey. Monkeys must do the same as the others.
[2015/11/10 12:26:40] <head8debian> We can support it, but it doesn't mean we have to use it ourselves. :)
[2015/11/10 12:27:00] <Hume2> Yes.
[2015/11/10 12:27:19] <Hume2> It needs to hack the camera to send some random faces.
[2015/11/10 12:27:29] <head8debian> I do use it, and what little i don't like...
[2015/11/10 12:27:34] <Hume2> Don't you know how to make a random face generator?
[2015/11/10 12:27:55] <head8debian> Ehm, no?
[2015/11/10 12:28:26] <Hume2> I think, messing up Microsoft's server with junk data could work.
[2015/11/10 12:28:34] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/10 12:28:57] <head8debian> How are you going to mess up their servers when they use linux? :p
[2015/11/10 12:29:07] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 12:29:36] <Hume2> Well, let's start milions virtual machines with windows 10.
[2015/11/10 12:29:54] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 264 seconds
[2015/11/10 12:30:04] <Hume2> Well, that's not a good idea.
[2015/11/10 12:30:14] <head8debian> It would take more like billions...
[2015/11/10 12:31:01] <Hume2> Do you think that they have any backups of that spy-data?
[2015/11/10 12:32:35] <Hume2> I read that a new type of viruses have been invited. They install your OS as a virtual machine, so you can't get that they are even on your computer. Any way.
[2015/11/10 12:34:37] <Hume2> They could then send fake data to the camera and keyboard.
[2015/11/10 12:35:31] <Hume2> ...but no idea how to make those viruses...
[2015/11/10 12:36:38] <brmbrmcar> Awesome hacks!
[2015/11/10 12:40:05] <brmbrmcar> On a Microsoft e-mail account, I think that you can change your name to a script, possibly accessing more scripts that could destroy the servers.
[2015/11/10 12:40:54] <Hume2> I guess that special characters are blocked, so that wouldn't work. However, it could be good if that worked.
[2015/11/10 12:43:17] <brmbrmcar> It allows all xharacters.
[2015/11/10 12:45:58] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I think that it just displays those characters, but they are saved another way.
[2015/11/10 12:47:10] <Hume2> Anyway, it would have to run that script somehow. And I don't think that their software is equiped to run the scripts from usernames.
[2015/11/10 12:48:31] @ bb010g joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:48:59] <head8debian> Just drop a bomb on one of their server rooms...
[2015/11/10 12:49:45] <Hume2> That works too, but it's quite too simple.
[2015/11/10 12:51:11] <Hume2> Anyway, when it sends the users' photos, it can measure the dimensions of their skull.
[2015/11/10 12:51:40] <brmbrmcar> I know it works to run scripts to make you an admin.
[2015/11/10 12:51:55] <Hume2> So they know, what race you are and where you live. Doesn't it resemble you anything?
[2015/11/10 12:52:39] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes, but some kind of boss must make you an admin. And there are tons of passwords.
[2015/11/10 12:53:48] <brmbrmcar> I mean, the develpors surely use some sort of GUI.
[2015/11/10 12:54:28] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:54:41] <Hume2> Yes, that's it. You'd have to force a developer to make you an admin.
[2015/11/10 12:55:02] <brmbrmcar> I'll try and find a video of the hack.
[2015/11/10 12:56:32] <brmbrmcar> I cannot find it. Probably taken down.
[2015/11/10 13:00:00] <Hume2> Do you think that they could misuse the data to make a genocide?
[2015/11/10 13:01:03] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/10 13:01:09] <brmbrmcar> But they wouldn't.
[2015/11/10 13:01:48] <Hume2> Could we be sure?
[2015/11/10 13:03:45] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/10 13:03:59] <brmbrmcar> We need to destroy Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 13:04:11] <brmbrmcar> Before they destroy one of us.
[2015/11/10 13:04:39] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2015/11/10 13:05:08] <Hume2> It needs something easy and effective.
[2015/11/10 13:08:24] @ Wuzzy joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 13:09:06] <Hume2> What about funny wideos with anti-Windows theme? Can it ever become popular?
[2015/11/10 13:12:12] <Hume2> What about a new SuperTux sign with crossed Windows logo?
[2015/11/10 13:12:34] <brmbrmcar> Supertux logo!
[2015/11/10 13:12:47] <brmbrmcar> No Apple builds either.
[2015/11/10 13:13:01] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: We need Tobbi though
[2015/11/10 13:14:50] <Hume2> I like those anti-Windowsish memes, they are so funny!
[2015/11/10 13:15:49] <Hume2> Automatic updates on Windows 8: Changing shape, don't turn off the computer.
[2015/11/10 13:16:17] <Hume2> Widows 8 causes the global warming.
[2015/11/10 13:16:38] <brmbrmcar> It certainally contributes to it.
[2015/11/10 13:17:54] <Hume2> Windows 8 needs a bazilion of ventilators to don't melt.
[2015/11/10 13:18:49] <brmbrmcar> Windows 8 overheats computers.
[2015/11/10 13:18:52] <Hume2> One pin of procesor has melted down. If not, correct it.
[2015/11/10 13:19:36] <Hume2> Your RAM is not supprted. Try DDR6 or newer.
[2015/11/10 13:24:10] <brmbrmcar> Please make this freezer colder.
[2015/11/10 13:25:44] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:28:30] <brmbrmcar> My laptop is fanless and has never overheated.
[2015/11/10 13:28:53] <brmbrmcar> Windows computers overheat in Antarctica.
[2015/11/10 13:28:58] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:29:31] <Hume2> Is it allowed to stick anti-Windowsish memes on the streats?
[2015/11/10 13:30:49] <brmbrmcar> Maybe.

[2015/11/10 13:31:55] <Hume2> It can't be a comparing ad, so there can't be any advertisement to any other system.
[2015/11/10 13:32:58] <brmbrmcar> How about advertise Windows, but make it bad?
[2015/11/10 13:33:42] <Hume2> Yes, like an ad, that will freak out more likely.
[2015/11/10 13:34:01] <brmbrmcar> Like Windows 10. Want to be hacked?
[2015/11/10 13:34:11] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:34:50] <Hume2> Or something that will not metion that it's about Windows, but still freaking out of it.
[2015/11/10 13:35:13] <Hume2> For example, there will be "Blindous 10" instead of "Windows 10".
[2015/11/10 13:35:32] <brmbrmcar> HP Stream. The 200 euro brick.
[2015/11/10 13:35:42] <Hume2> What's that?
[2015/11/10 13:36:25] <brmbrmcar> It is a cheap Chromebook competitor that runs Windows.

[2015/11/10 14:10:40] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Do you know personally anyone who tells that Windows 10 is good?
[2015/11/10 14:11:44] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Only kids like Windows 10.
[2015/11/10 14:11:55] <brmbrmcar> And Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 14:12:21] <Hume2> Just find someone who will stick those things across the streats.
[2015/11/10 14:13:04] <brmbrmcar> Easy.
[2015/11/10 14:13:28] <Hume2> Narre could do that :D
[2015/11/10 14:13:55] <Hume2> Don't ever tell him that I mentioned him, he doesn't like it.
[2015/11/10 14:14:17] <Hume2> Sometimes at night...
[2015/11/10 14:14:32] <Hume2> And watch out the hidden cameras.
[2015/11/10 14:16:37] <brmbrmcar> If he did it carefully, he could probably do it in a blindspot.
[2015/11/10 14:17:20] <Hume2> If I was sure that noone could see me, I'd do it.
[2015/11/10 14:19:26] <Hume2> I could stick some to the bus stops those are already sticked by many stuff.
[2015/11/10 14:20:05] <brmbrmcar> I was thinking of bus stops.
[2015/11/10 14:21:53] <Hume2> Do you think that it could have any effect?
[2015/11/10 14:22:02] <brmbrmcar> Possibly.
[2015/11/10 14:22:11] <Hume2> Same for me.
[2015/11/10 14:22:59] <brmbrmcar> Maybe if it was very high quality, people wouldn't take it as much of a joke.
[2015/11/10 14:23:19] <brmbrmcar> And at the bottom write on legal stuff.
[2015/11/10 14:24:26] <Hume2> Yes. I think that there should be also someting that is called "Blindous 10". I could be really whatever, even an application that throws an error and closes.
[2015/11/10 14:24:46] <Hume2> And it must be for free.
[2015/11/10 14:25:18] <brmbrmcar> Open source.
[2015/11/10 14:25:35] <Hume2> Why not?
[2015/11/10 14:26:52] <brmbrmcar> Indeed.
[2015/11/10 14:28:57] <Hume2> Well, is there something that it could contain in addition?
[2015/11/10 14:30:54] <Hume2> I think that the people should notice it, so I wouldn't add much detail.
[2015/11/10 14:32:26] <Hume2> Is there a possibility that it would be in TV?
[2015/11/10 14:32:41] <brmbrmcar> How much does it cost?
[2015/11/10 14:34:09] <Hume2> Well, it costs one piece of paper and some glue. Not much.

[2015/11/10 23:41:01] <maths22> I have travis/appveyor based builds running off of my own forks here: http://brlcad.org/~maths22/supertux-nightly/
[2015/11/10 23:41:43] <maths22> The OSX one needs work so all the dependencies get included, but I think the others work
[2015/11/10 23:43:34] <maths22> If these builds seem good, I can re-work the scripts to integrate better in the offical repos

[2015/11/11 11:42:30] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: So why the level andrews_island_level6.stl has a castle background?
[2015/11/11 11:42:40] <brmbrmcar> Will fix.
[2015/11/11 11:42:57] <brmbrmcar> I also noticed a couple of things I forgot.
[2015/11/11 11:43:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: ;( My neighbor down the road has 10mb/s internet. And im stuck on 3 with a unreliable ISP. :( :p
[2015/11/11 11:43:01] <maths22> Also, I have discovered my RPM build does nto work
[2015/11/11 11:43:08] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:43:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Ask them to upgrade you.
[2015/11/11 11:43:25] <maths22> Tobbi: what version of OSX are you on?
[2015/11/11 11:43:47] <Tobbi> maths22: 10.11.1
[2015/11/11 11:44:13] <maths22> OK.  That actually may be why it doesn't work
[2015/11/11 11:44:27] <maths22> I'll see if I can test/debug on a machine with El Capitan
[2015/11/11 11:45:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, they wouldn't because the person with the tower chose their most expensive plan. :D
[2015/11/11 11:45:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh? :D
[2015/11/11 11:45:44] <Tobbi> I see.
[2015/11/11 11:45:56] <head8debian> $120/month...
[2015/11/11 11:46:49] <head8debian> I have better upload speeds then them yet though. :D
[2015/11/11 11:47:37] <maths22> Tobbi: What kind of error do you get?
[2015/11/11 11:49:02] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: the level 5 was unlaunchable, so I corrected it.
[2015/11/11 11:49:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: And i suposably have a bandwidth cap which ive never seen implemented when ive gone 5 times over it...
[2015/11/11 11:49:20] <Tobbi> maths22: you can't open the application because it may be damaged or incomplete
[2015/11/11 11:49:28] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:49:40] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You can edit the infoblock's message by editor. It's called "edit script", but it's the message in fact.
[2015/11/11 11:49:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: roughtly 100gb. :p
[2015/11/11 11:49:53] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:50:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't have a bandwidth cap, fortunately.
[2015/11/11 11:50:06] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: I k-now.
[2015/11/11 11:50:08] <head8debian> :)
[2015/11/11 11:50:16] <maths22> Tobbi: see http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/58086
[2015/11/11 11:50:19] <brmbrmcar> How do you change the font though?
[2015/11/11 11:50:33] <maths22> Do you have that set to Anywhere, or something else?
[2015/11/11 11:50:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: Your a city slicker... i live in the middle of knowwhere, 10 miles from decent internet. Ok, more like 3. :p
[2015/11/11 11:50:42] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You put the formating char to the begining.
[2015/11/11 11:50:52] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: # stands for normal text.
[2015/11/11 11:50:58] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/11 11:51:07] <brmbrmcar> Didn't know that.
[2015/11/11 11:51:15] * head8debian should just start running fiber from house to house out here... then set up a cache server...
[2015/11/11 11:51:20] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: - stands for big text, space is small text and tab is blue text.
[2015/11/11 11:51:51] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: ! stands for image and any other char is black text.
[2015/11/11 11:53:22] <Tobbi> maths22: Hmm, supertux opens just fine when I double-click on the contained executable.
[2015/11/11 11:53:37] <maths22> That is what I expected
[2015/11/11 11:53:48] <maths22> It is a silly OS X security issue type of thing
[2015/11/11 11:53:57] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: For the level 5, it's nice. Just take a look at note 5 or 4. You can just add some poles so the wood won't levitate.
[2015/11/11 11:54:08] <Tobbi> maths22: No, the issue is still there, even if I disable that thingy from above.
[2015/11/11 11:54:22] <maths22> Tobbi: I figured
[2015/11/11 11:55:18] <maths22> I'll try to fix that this afternoon
[2015/11/11 11:56:00] <maths22> I also need to change linux so it includes the libraries in the package
[2015/11/11 11:56:39] <Tobbi> maths22: So, do you know what's wrong then?
[2015/11/11 11:57:20] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: level6, We have a cave background, even a cave music, so you can use it.
[2015/11/11 11:57:32] <maths22> Not sure, but since it is not an El Capitan specifc issue, I should be able to debug it
[2015/11/11 11:57:56] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/11 11:59:04] <maths22> Can you try editing the Info.plist so that CFBundleExecutable is SuperTux and not supertux2?
[2015/11/11 12:00:00] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: For level6, take a look at notes 4, 5, 6, 14 and 31.
[2015/11/11 12:00:43] <Tobbi> maths22: 11.11.15 17:58:06,159 lsd[367]: LaunchServices: Could not store lsd-identifiers file at /private/var/db/lsd/com.apple.lsdschemes.plist
[2015/11/11 12:00:48] <Tobbi> That's what I get.
[2015/11/11 12:00:53] <Tobbi> Not sure if it helps you in any way.
[2015/11/11 12:02:33] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: OK.
[2015/11/11 12:03:29] <maths22> Tobbi: thanks.  I'll take a look later on my school's machines
[2015/11/11 12:03:34] <Tobbi> Sure.

[2015/11/11 12:28:39] <maths22> Ideally, more of our version numbers would be in the same place (so we don't have to go tracking each of them down to update the version)

[2015/11/11 12:45:43] <Tobbi> Apparently I didn't exceed the character count.
[2015/11/11 12:45:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: what_
[2015/11/11 12:45:46] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/11/11 12:46:31] <head8debian> Im tryign to set up squid with 2 ethernet cards and nano... :p
[2015/11/11 12:46:33] <mt> no https (or at least hashes) for the nightly builds?
[2015/11/11 12:46:56] <Tobbi> ask maths22
[2015/11/11 12:47:18] <mt> next week you'll have no execuse for not supporting TLS (https://letsencrypt.org/) :P
[2015/11/11 12:47:55] <Tobbi> great!
[2015/11/11 12:51:35] <brmbrmcar> maths22: How do I install the linux tar.gz file?
[2015/11/11 12:53:50] <Tobbi> maths22, head8debian, Karkus, mt: What do you guys think? http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=6630
[2015/11/11 12:55:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: Great!
[2015/11/11 12:55:59] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 12:56:04] <Tobbi> So there's that.
[2015/11/11 12:56:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: The only thing on that list which has remained unaffected by this project is my cat
[2015/11/11 12:56:50] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 12:58:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: If I had a cat, I believe, I'd try Schroedinger's experiment with it.
[2015/11/11 12:58:47] <Tobbi> So, it's good that I don't have one.
[2015/11/11 12:58:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah
[2015/11/11 12:59:13] <Karkus> Probably
[2015/11/11 12:59:48] <Karkus> Not a very interesting experiment really though is it Tobbi?
[2015/11/11 13:00:09] <Karkus> Outcomes 1) Cat ded 2) Cat live
[2015/11/11 13:00:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: Not as interesting as the Babies-in-the-dishwasher experiment. Exactly!
[2015/11/11 13:00:42] <Tobbi> While the babies-in-the-dishwasher experiment has a multitude of different outcomes, fractures, amount of blood etc.
[2015/11/11 13:01:03] <Karkus> And all of them are super exciting!
[2015/11/11 13:01:26] <Tobbi> For sure!
[2015/11/11 13:01:37] <brmbrmcar> Poor babies.
[2015/11/11 13:03:34] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: No, wrong. Poor dishwasher, rather.
[2015/11/11 13:03:36] <Karkus> Well, older rich people don't submit themse as willing volunteers
[2015/11/11 13:03:43] <Karkus> themselves*
[2015/11/11 13:06:29] <brmbrmcar> How about my method of harming babies?
[2015/11/11 13:06:36] <brmbrmcar> No restraint.
[2015/11/11 13:06:39] <brmbrmcar> Crash!
[2015/11/11 13:08:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: You, know what's best about nightly builds?
[2015/11/11 13:09:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: what?

[2015/11/11 13:09:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: good? I think that's a bad thing :D
[2015/11/11 13:09:44] <Tobbi> Meaning more bugs for all of us.
[2015/11/11 13:09:50] <Tobbi> But wait, we had that topic, already.
[2015/11/11 13:10:16] <brmbrmcar> Bugs are good.

[2015/11/11 13:15:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Shall I close it?
[2015/11/11 13:15:17] <mt> maths22: please - try to link the linux binaries statically, else it will break on distros that don't use the same library versions as the build system's distro
[2015/11/11 13:15:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: You could. I wonder how often maths22 is willing to build these, but, yeah, go ahead.
[2015/11/11 13:16:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: Manually built?
[2015/11/11 13:16:10] <mt> maths22: like "games/supertux2: error while loading shared libraries: libGLEW.so.1.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory", I'm already using glew-1.13.0
[2015/11/11 13:16:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, I mean "trigger a build", afaik he still has to do it.
[2015/11/11 13:16:41] <brmbrmcar> ./supertux2: error while loading shared libraries: libtinygettext.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[2015/11/11 13:17:00] <mt> brmbrmcar: yeah that's because it's not statically linked
[2015/11/11 13:17:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, it can't be considered a nightly release then...
[2015/11/11 13:17:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: hmm, right....but maybe he is willing to build them every day.
[2015/11/11 13:17:35] <mt> Karkus: well, you can write a cronjob triggering it every night
[2015/11/11 13:17:55] <Tobbi> I could've labeled them developer releases, but that would be confusing.
[2015/11/11 13:18:00] <brmbrmcar> mt:So what do I have to do?
[2015/11/11 13:18:25] <mt> brmbrmcar: wait until the builds are statically linked
[2015/11/11 13:18:54] <brmbrmcar> What can I do in the meantime? Do i have to build tinygettext?
[2015/11/11 13:19:02] <Karkus> mt: But does he want to? (or rather will he?)
[2015/11/11 13:19:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah, not that
[2015/11/11 13:19:50] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Why do you depend on developer releases. You know how to build supertux, don't you?
[2015/11/11 13:20:20] <brmbrmcar> Not really.
[2015/11/11 13:20:37] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You never built supertux yourself?
[2015/11/11 13:20:39] <brmbrmcar> I don't know how to build sdl 2.03.
[2015/11/11 13:20:48] <brmbrmcar> I used the ppa.
[2015/11/11 13:20:48] <Tobbi> Do you need to build it?
[2015/11/11 13:20:54] <Tobbi> So, where's the problem?
[2015/11/11 13:20:55] <brmbrmcar> On Ubuntu.
[2015/11/11 13:21:07] <brmbrmcar> All sorts of bugs.
[2015/11/11 13:21:20] <brmbrmcar> And this was on my previous Ubuntu install.
[2015/11/11 13:21:22] <mt> Building on Ubuntu works just fine
[2015/11/11 13:21:35] <mt> Travis builds are running on ubuntu
[2015/11/11 13:21:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe we should assemble a WIP release notes document.
[2015/11/11 13:21:53] <Tobbi> And make it organization-visible only for now.
[2015/11/11 13:22:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: On Google docs for example?
[2015/11/11 13:22:21] <Karkus> Or what and how?
[2015/11/11 13:22:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: I wonder if Github allows you to do secret wiki pages?
[2015/11/11 13:22:28] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/11 13:22:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Secret gist?
[2015/11/11 13:22:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: I like this idea very much.
[2015/11/11 13:22:54] <Tobbi> That might work!
[2015/11/11 13:23:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: It doesn't have to be secret...
[2015/11/11 13:23:24] <Tobbi> Sure, I just don't want people to assume this is an actual release right now.
[2015/11/11 13:23:30] <Tobbi> So, yeah, indeed, there's nothing secret about it.
[2015/11/11 13:24:22] <brmbrmcar> So I can't see it!
[2015/11/11 13:25:06] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What?
[2015/11/11 13:25:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Are you drafting the gist or shall I?
[2015/11/11 13:25:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: How do I create a gist as SuperTux?
[2015/11/11 13:25:32] <Tobbi> Ah, one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:25:34] <brmbrmcar> I won't be able to see it!
[2015/11/11 13:25:44] <brmbrmcar> It is a secret.
[2015/11/11 13:25:58] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: We'll see.
[2015/11/11 13:26:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: Having a secret gist would be a little complex
[2015/11/11 13:26:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, anyone with the url could see it
[2015/11/11 13:26:38] <Karkus> but the URL wouldn't have to be publiv
[2015/11/11 13:26:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: There doesn't seem to be any way to create a gist as an organization.
[2015/11/11 13:27:13] <Tobbi> https://gist.github.com/tobbi/c9fd5380aed73ce4bb82
[2015/11/11 13:27:18] <Tobbi> Wonder if you can access it and edit it.
[2015/11/11 13:28:22] <brmbrmcar> I can see it.
[2015/11/11 13:28:28] <Tobbi> Yes, but editing...
[2015/11/11 13:28:41] <Tobbi> actually, one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:28:46] <mt> I wonder if forking as organization would work
[2015/11/11 13:28:49] <brmbrmcar> Not editing.
[2015/11/11 13:28:58] <Karkus> Nope.
[2015/11/11 13:30:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: Damn.
[2015/11/11 13:30:31] <Tobbi> one moment, I'll find a way...
[2015/11/11 13:30:32] <brmbrmcar> I forked it.
[2015/11/11 13:30:33] <Tobbi> an etherpad, or something.
[2015/11/11 13:30:39] <brmbrmcar> And could edit.
[2015/11/11 13:30:48] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Won't help.
[2015/11/11 13:31:21] <brmbrmcar> I k-now.

[2015/11/11 13:33:41] <leyyin> Tobbi, your document is getting vandalized
[2015/11/11 13:33:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: By you?
[2015/11/11 13:34:03] <leyyin> I only added "Woohooo"
[2015/11/11 13:34:07] <Tobbi> gargh
[2015/11/11 13:34:11] <Tobbi> Let's try the wiki.
[2015/11/11 13:34:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: I added git shortlog v0.3.5..HEAD
[2015/11/11 13:34:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: I just wondered if it worked
[2015/11/11 13:34:35] <Tobbi> Aka, all commits since v0.3.5a
[2015/11/11 13:34:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, all the git commits
[2015/11/11 13:34:41] <Tobbi> oh!
[2015/11/11 13:34:41] <Karkus> Okay
[2015/11/11 13:34:43] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:34:47] <Tobbi> Wrong version.
[2015/11/11 13:35:04] <mt> can '^Merge pull request #.*' be excluded
[2015/11/11 13:35:20] <brmbrmcar> I think so.
[2015/11/11 13:35:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: You can stop it getting vandalised by just anyone can you not?
[2015/11/11 13:35:30] <Tobbi> I could
[2015/11/11 13:35:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe we should use the wiki, though.
[2015/11/11 13:35:40] <Tobbi> Now that I think about it.
[2015/11/11 13:35:47] <Karkus> I typed the newlines. But they're gone now
[2015/11/11 13:35:51] <Tobbi> Anyone here who does not have a wiki account?
[2015/11/11 13:36:03] <Karkus> Err... Me I think.
[2015/11/11 13:36:06] <Karkus> Let me check
[2015/11/11 13:36:27] <brmbrmcar> Done.
[2015/11/11 13:36:38] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: done what?
[2015/11/11 13:37:59] <brmbrmcar> Removed merge pull requests.

[2015/11/11 13:46:13] <maths22> about static linking
[2015/11/11 13:46:44] <mt> ok
[2015/11/11 13:47:23] <maths22> Also, once it is integrated into the offical repos, it should be triggered by a push
[2015/11/11 13:47:46] <Tobbi> maths22: How often will you trigger builds?
[2015/11/11 13:48:40] <maths22> Tobbi: once everything is working, there will be a set of pull requests (to tinygettext, squirrel, and supertux)
[2015/11/11 13:48:47] <maths22> After that, it will run on every commit
[2015/11/11 13:49:05] <maths22> it uses travis to handle the OS X and Linux builds
[2015/11/11 13:49:10] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 13:49:16] <maths22> AppVeyor is used to handle Windows
[2015/11/11 13:49:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: Mediawiki is great! It doesn't allow me to change a password for a user without access to a database.
[2015/11/11 13:49:42] <Tobbi> It only allows me to send a password reset email :D
[2015/11/11 13:50:10] <maths22> Also, I think I may change the upload name to include the commit hash (and only keep tags and the 10 most recent or something like that)
[2015/11/11 13:50:18] <maths22> I also need to fix the OSX icon
[2015/11/11 13:51:23] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: What's wrong with that?

[2015/11/11 13:55:31] <leyyin> maths22, any documentation on how you did the builds on travis? :D
[2015/11/11 13:57:40] <Tobbi> Oh! AppVeyor is free for opensource apps...
[2015/11/11 13:57:41] <Tobbi> Great!
[2015/11/11 13:58:43] <brmbrmcar> Free!
[2015/11/11 13:59:03] <head8debian> Yay! Polipo! :p
[2015/11/11 13:59:26] <brmbrmcar> Celebrate!
[2015/11/11 13:59:32] <brmbrmcar> :)
[2015/11/11 13:59:47] <Tobbi> We could actually assemble a list of people who contributed and update the credits.
[2015/11/11 14:00:03] <Tobbi> If the number of contributions is > n where n is a positive integeer.
[2015/11/11 14:00:06] <Tobbi> *integer
[2015/11/11 14:00:22] <leyyin> 2^128
[2015/11/11 14:00:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Contributions is a fairly arbitrary unit, isn't it?
[2015/11/11 14:01:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yeah, indeed.
[2015/11/11 14:01:12] <maths22> leyyin: No documentation yet.  I can write some up once I have cleaned up my .travis.yml to be less ugly
[2015/11/11 14:01:56] <brmbrmcar> brmbrmcar Absolutely Nothing
[2015/11/11 14:02:07] <leyyin> ah, I found it, thanks maths22
[2015/11/11 14:03:39] <maths22> I also need to re-enable debug builds, etc, but only make these binaries for the release one
[2015/11/11 14:04:12] <maths22> Also, I think my branch only works in LLVM, so I need to fix that
[2015/11/11 14:04:24] <Tobbi> Hah! The overall number of my commits to SuperTux is 444
[2015/11/11 14:04:41] <leyyin> nice, I did not know about the apt addon in travis, TIL
[2015/11/11 14:04:58] <maths22> leyyin: it is relatively new
[2015/11/11 14:05:02] <Karkus> Mine should soon rise to 9
[2015/11/11 14:05:33] <maths22> also, SDL2 is only in the offical repos on 14.04, so I have it build on 14.04 so we don't need to build it ourselves
[2015/11/11 14:06:05] <Karkus> maths22 is it building automatically each day?
[2015/11/11 14:06:08] <Tobbi> maths22: Wait, travis allows you to build on 14.04 now?
[2015/11/11 14:06:27] <maths22> see https://github.com/maths22/supertux/blob/master/.travis.yml
[2015/11/11 14:06:32] <maths22> Karkus: not yet
[2015/11/11 14:06:51] <Tobbi> That is great!
[2015/11/11 14:06:57] <maths22> Once I have everything working and polished up, I will submit a pull request to the official repository, and this will hopefully get integrated in
[2015/11/11 14:07:01] <Tobbi> Sure, thanks!
[2015/11/11 14:07:15] <maths22> Karkus: then it will run with every push
[2015/11/11 14:07:17] <Tobbi> maths22: Does that add-on do deps caching? I assume no?
[2015/11/11 14:07:38] <maths22> Tobbi: no, but it runs pretty fast
[2015/11/11 14:07:42] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 14:07:53] <maths22> Builds (with packaging and uploads) take ~7 minutes
[2015/11/11 14:08:05] <Karkus> maths22: Every push!?
[2015/11/11 14:08:08] <maths22> https://travis-ci.org/maths22/supertux
[2015/11/11 14:08:13] <maths22> Karkus: yep!
[2015/11/11 14:08:22] <maths22> It just adds a step to the end of travis
[2015/11/11 14:08:53] <leyyin> and now you can do mac build too, hmm
[2015/11/11 14:08:56] <leyyin> windows too? :D
[2015/11/11 14:09:11] <maths22> leyyin: windows through AppVeyor
[2015/11/11 14:09:12] <Tobbi> Who cares about Windows? :P
[2015/11/11 14:09:32] <maths22> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maths22/supertux
[2015/11/11 14:09:33] <brmbrmcar> I don't.
[2015/11/11 14:09:39] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I was being ironic.
[2015/11/11 14:09:40] <brmbrmcar> Who cares about OSX?
[2015/11/11 14:09:46] <brmbrmcar> You.
[2015/11/11 14:09:51] <maths22> Tobbi: people who use Windows
[2015/11/11 14:09:55] <maths22> brmbrmcar: people who use OSX
[2015/11/11 14:09:56] <maths22> :)
[2015/11/11 14:10:00] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/11 14:10:11] <brmbrmcar> I use Linux
[2015/11/11 14:10:18] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I figured
[2015/11/11 14:10:48] <brmbrmcar> There is no good alternative apart from browser operating systems.
[2015/11/11 14:10:53] <Karkus> Who cares about Linux
[2015/11/11 14:10:57] <Karkus> :P
[2015/11/11 14:11:01] <Karkus> jk
[2015/11/11 14:11:28] <maths22> I also created a new dependency zip that includes the newest boot and VC14 boost libraries
[2015/11/11 14:11:39] <leyyin> maths22, so this is the only file you need for appveyor https://github.com/maths22/supertux/blob/master/appveyor.yml ?
[2015/11/11 14:11:52] <maths22> leyyin: yes
[2015/11/11 14:12:27] <maths22> It is nice and clean
[2015/11/11 14:12:31] <Tobbi> maths22: Could you package our final release as well? Or rather build a release build when we want to release?
[2015/11/11 14:12:54] <maths22> Tobbi: I will have it keep tagged builds (and not clean them up)
[2015/11/11 14:13:01] <maths22> It will also name tagged builds differently
[2015/11/11 14:13:03] <Tobbi> Great!
[2015/11/11 14:13:15] <maths22> (How that will work, I'm not yet sure, but I'll figure it out)
[2015/11/11 14:13:30] * leyyin takes notes for STK
[2015/11/11 14:13:33] <maths22> Tobbi: it also only packages the release one
[2015/11/11 14:13:58] <maths22> Also, can we assemble a list of everywhere we use the version number (or development state, like the main logo)
[2015/11/11 14:14:23] <Tobbi> yeah, we should do that.
[2015/11/11 14:15:54] <Tobbi> By the way, guys: http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Changelog_0.4.0_%28WIP%29
[2015/11/11 14:16:21] <Tobbi> Karkus, mt, head8debian, maths22, brmbrmcar ^^ if you want to contribute
[2015/11/11 14:17:00] <Tobbi> We would need to pick the most important changes and create releases notes from them.
[2015/11/11 14:17:16] <maths22> Do we know of anywhere besides CMakeLists.txt and data/images/objects/logo/logo.sprite
[2015/11/11 14:17:17] <Tobbi> I suggest we keep out the xmas stuff though, in order to keep them a surprise.
[2015/11/11 14:17:46] <Tobbi> CMakeLists.txt
[2015/11/11 14:17:53] <Tobbi> it uses patch levels etc.
[2015/11/11 14:17:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: So this isn't the actual file, just a draft of things which have been added?
[2015/11/11 14:18:05] <Karkus> To be developed into that.
[2015/11/11 14:18:11] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, exactly.
[2015/11/11 14:18:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: However, I intend to just move the file once it's ready and supertux is about to be released.
[2015/11/11 14:20:09] <maths22> Tobbi: for releases, we can actually use http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/
[2015/11/11 14:20:24] <maths22> Tobbi: they will then go straight into github
[2015/11/11 14:20:38] <maths22> I will mess with that feature later
[2015/11/11 14:21:20] <Tobbi> maths22: How would those be triggered? We just add tags?
[2015/11/11 14:21:46] <maths22> I believe so
[2015/11/11 14:22:04] <maths22> I'll investigate tonight
[2015/11/11 14:22:12] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/11 14:23:08] <leyyin> maths22, only the new containers are 14.04? not the old infrastructure
[2015/11/11 14:27:30] <leyyin> actually we can do windows cross compiling on linux, who needs windows anyways :P
[2015/11/11 14:27:41] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/11 14:27:47] <Tobbi> leyyin: well, I use it regularly...
[2015/11/11 14:29:18] <maths22> leyyin: i actually was going to cross-comple, but then I discovered appveyor
[2015/11/11 14:29:51] <leyyin> one problem I think it is, how you can upload the bundles securely to your file server
