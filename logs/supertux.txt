[2015/12/03 10:35:39] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Will you be civil today and not be getting on our nerves?
[2015/12/03 10:36:19] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/12/03 10:36:37] <brmbrmcar> Thw Windsows builds aren't working on Wine...
[2015/12/03 10:36:47] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Error message?
[2015/12/03 10:37:00] <brmbrmcar> None.
[2015/12/03 10:37:14] <brmbrmcar> It compiles, but doesn't sart.
[2015/12/03 10:37:28] <brmbrmcar> bin/supertux2.exe
[2015/12/03 10:37:30] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: That should still give you an error message.
[2015/12/03 10:37:42] <brmbrmcar> How?
[2015/12/03 10:37:45] <brmbrmcar> Where?
[2015/12/03 10:38:30] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How do you start the build?
[2015/12/03 10:38:42] <brmbrmcar> I just downloaded it.
[2015/12/03 10:39:16] <brmbrmcar> I opened he file,and followed the instructions.
[2015/12/03 10:39:41] <brmbrmcar> Open with Wine.
[2015/12/03 10:43:55] <leyyin> Tobbi, do you want to hear something funny?
[2015/12/03 10:44:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: Sure.
[2015/12/03 10:45:06] <leyyin> this year at my university, the 'Security' course is taught by Bitdefender (the anti-virus company), well they got good teachers, because last summer they got caught with having stored PLAIN PASSWORDS http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/07/31/bitdefender-hacked/
[2015/12/03 10:45:08] <leyyin> idiots
[2015/12/03 10:45:40] <leyyin> how the heck can you store plain text passwords, and you are a security firm......
[2015/12/03 10:45:47] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/03 10:45:58] <leyyin> *this summer
[2015/12/03 10:46:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: How comes they even let outside companies teach a security course at a university?
[2015/12/03 10:46:38] <leyyin> because we are corporate slaves
[2015/12/03 10:46:53] <leyyin> we have 3-4 (optional courses) taught by people from corporations
[2015/12/03 10:47:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: At least they're optional...
[2015/12/03 10:48:02] <Tobbi> leyyin: Our small university is too small to be corporate slaves anyway...
[2015/12/03 10:49:03] <leyyin> well it depends on semester, you got too choose some optional courses
[2015/12/03 10:49:08] <leyyin> 2 out of 6 courses
[2015/12/03 10:49:13] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/12/03 10:49:27] <Tobbi> leyyin: Want to know what I noticed? I worry too much :P
[2015/12/03 10:49:43] <leyyin> so this is unheard off in Germany? having corporations teach a course?
[2015/12/03 10:49:57] <leyyin> do you have ads at your university?
[2015/12/03 10:49:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: Probably not... But it's not common, I'd think.
[2015/12/03 10:50:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: No?
[2015/12/03 10:50:08] <leyyin> by corporations ? :D
[2015/12/03 10:50:11] <leyyin> we have them too
[2015/12/03 10:50:22] <Tobbi> leyyin: Universities are not private...
[2015/12/03 10:50:29] <leyyin> yeah
[2015/12/03 10:50:32] <leyyin> this one too
[2015/12/03 10:50:38] <Tobbi> That's weird.
[2015/12/03 10:50:39] <leyyin> but we got ads by corporations :D
[2015/12/03 10:50:52] <leyyin> "Check out our awesome company"
[2015/12/03 10:50:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: That is totally mental.
[2015/12/03 10:50:55] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/12/03 10:51:10] <leyyin> even in big lecture rooms
[2015/12/03 10:51:14] <leyyin> in front of the class
[2015/12/03 10:51:28] <brmbrmcar> Can I put up an ad?
[2015/12/03 10:51:45] <leyyin> Tobbi, and friends think I am crazy when I tell them this is not normal :D
[2015/12/03 10:52:13] <Tobbi> leyyin: Okay, tell them to come to the Fachhochschule Flensburg. There are no ads, never...
[2015/12/03 10:52:21] <Tobbi> leyyin: We do, however, have a list of openings...
[2015/12/03 10:52:31] <Tobbi> But that's not the same.
[2015/12/03 10:53:51] <leyyin> list of openings?
[2015/12/03 10:54:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: ubuntu is not debian, and ubuntu is still not stuck on version 9.
[2015/12/03 10:54:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: job openings...
[2015/12/03 10:54:32] <Tobbi> So, companies post their openings on to a blackboard.
[2015/12/03 10:54:40] <leyyin> ah ok, that is totally different
[2015/12/03 10:55:02] <brmbrmcar> Debian is better than Ubuntu.
[2015/12/03 10:55:18] <leyyin> linux is better than debian
[2015/12/03 10:55:45] <leyyin> Tobbi, thank you for making me feel normal :D
[2015/12/03 10:55:52] <leyyin> so I am not crazy when I am against those ads
[2015/12/03 10:56:02] <Tobbi> leyyin: Normal depends on your definition...
[2015/12/03 10:56:14] <brmbrmcar> Debian is Linux.
[2015/12/03 10:56:21] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, impossible
[2015/12/03 10:56:27] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, debian is a fork of windows
[2015/12/03 10:56:31] <brmbrmcar> Linux distro
[2015/12/03 10:56:38] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, not true
[2015/12/03 10:56:46] <brmbrmcar> leyyin: You are messing with me.
[2015/12/03 10:56:55] <leyyin> not true either :D
[2015/12/03 10:57:00] <brmbrmcar> I HATE WINDOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[2015/12/03 10:59:17] <brmbrmcar> Nope.
[2015/12/03 10:59:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: Do these outside lecturers advertise their company?
[2015/12/03 10:59:31] <leyyin> Tobbi, idk, I never went to one
[2015/12/03 10:59:32] <leyyin> Tobbi, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[2015/12/03 10:59:37] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2015/12/03 10:59:43] <leyyin> [17:56:30] <@Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You're messing with yourself.
[2015/12/03 10:59:53] <brmbrmcar> 15:57:17 < leyyin> [17:56:30] <@Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You're messing with yourself.
[2015/12/03 11:00:10] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, we had one lecturer who was the boss of spielen.de, an online platform for online games...
[2015/12/03 11:00:11] <brmbrmcar> leyyin started it!
[2015/12/03 11:00:24] <Tobbi> But he told us something about how to run a company etc.
[2015/12/03 11:00:26] <maths22> head8debian: Hopefully
[2015/12/03 11:00:33] <Tobbi> And did not advertise it in any way.
[2015/12/03 11:00:56] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Okay, so, if you mess with me, I will kick you, leyyin has free reign...but he is a respected member of this community.
[2015/12/03 11:00:59] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Which file, and what is the error?
[2015/12/03 11:01:34] <leyyin> hmm, I am an asshole, why I am respected thought
[2015/12/03 11:01:38] <leyyin> weird people :D
[2015/12/03 11:02:08] <Tobbi> leyyin: I can talk normally with you, thus you're respected.
[2015/12/03 11:02:14] <brmbrmcar> maths22: How do you get the errr message?
[2015/12/03 11:02:34] <brmbrmcar> maths22: I booted from bin/supertux2.exe
[2015/12/03 11:02:49] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Which installer version?
[2015/12/03 11:03:34] <brmbrmcar> I don't know. But I used SuperTux-0.3.5.507-win32.msi.
[2015/12/03 11:03:42] <maths22> That answers my question
[2015/12/03 11:03:49] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/03 11:04:24] <maths22> Try running it through the command line 'wine /path/to/bin/supertux2.exe'
[2015/12/03 11:04:32] <maths22> That should give you the error message
[2015/12/03 11:04:45] <maths22> (Otherwise, I'll try wine later today when I am running linux)

[2015/12/03 11:47:33] <Tobbi> damn...those implications...
[2015/12/03 11:47:44] <Tobbi> Er weilt nicht länger unter uns.
[2015/12/03 11:47:45] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/12/03 11:47:49] <Karkus> But then again, how would you know?
[2015/12/03 11:48:04] <Tobbi> I don't.
[2015/12/03 11:48:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Does that have the same implications?
[2015/12/03 11:48:11] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes.
[2015/12/03 11:48:22] <head8debian> This channel is becoming more and more german... next thing we know the title will be german.
[2015/12/03 11:48:22] <Tobbi> Or "Er ist nicht länger unter uns"
[2015/12/03 11:48:25] <head8debian> :D
[2015/12/03 11:48:43] <brmbrmcar> So each time I quit you worry that I might have died?

[2015/12/03 11:49:30] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: No, but when you leave randomly and never come back without ever saying anything ever again, it does imply.
[2015/12/03 11:49:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: I said that so you would do that, you know.
[2015/12/03 11:49:45] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/12/03 11:49:54] <Tobbi> I definitely like it better than this.
[2015/12/03 11:49:59] <head8debian> manipulation... :P
[2015/12/03 11:50:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am prone to that.
[2015/12/03 11:50:20] <head8debian> I honestly did figure that you would if i mentioned it. :)
[2015/12/03 11:50:33] <Tobbi> Wow, sometimes I just use words which I only kind of remember the meaning of.
[2015/12/03 11:50:36] <Tobbi> And later verify them.
[2015/12/03 11:50:51] <head8debian> ...
[2015/12/03 11:51:59] <brmbrmcar> Don't try and translate the links, you know that will not work...
[2015/12/03 11:54:49] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Of course they don't work!
[2015/12/03 11:55:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: When I comment on flexlay, notifico doesn't notify
[2015/12/03 11:55:22] <Tobbi> hmm, okay.
[2015/12/03 11:55:32] <Tobbi> mt: ^^
[2015/12/03 11:55:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could only show background images if the zoom level is above a certain value.
[2015/12/03 11:55:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: When I push, it works, but not in the same way
[2015/12/03 11:56:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: We could...
[2015/12/03 11:56:15] <Tobbi> how does the old editor do it?
[2015/12/03 11:56:25] <Tobbi> Can anyone of you guys check?
[2015/12/03 11:56:30] <Karkus> Just tiles them lots of times
[2015/12/03 11:56:38] <Karkus> I took a screen shot
[2015/12/03 11:57:08] <brmbrmcar> Which old editor?
[2015/12/03 11:57:33] <Tobbi> Oh, so that's the old one...
[2015/12/03 11:57:34] <Tobbi> right...
[2015/12/03 11:57:36] <Tobbi> of course.
[2015/12/03 11:57:45] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'm going to tranfer all the labels from supertux to flexlay, is that okay?
[2015/12/03 11:57:48] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/12/03 11:57:58] <Tobbi> makes sense.
[2015/12/03 11:58:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's the old one, yes
[2015/12/03 11:58:03] <brmbrmcar> Background shows fine on the 0.3.4-git one.
[2015/12/03 11:58:20] <Tobbi> tomorrow's my graduation party...
[2015/12/03 11:58:36] <Tobbi> well "party"
[2015/12/03 11:58:36] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Shows fine?
[2015/12/03 11:58:47] <Karkus> Why '"party"'?
[2015/12/03 11:59:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: Because it's just a graduation celebration with the president of the university and all graduates.
[2015/12/03 11:59:19] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: I mean on the standard editor.
[2015/12/03 11:59:20] <Tobbi> And family members.
[2015/12/03 11:59:28] <Tobbi> My father'll attend as well...
[2015/12/03 11:59:35] <Tobbi> And I had to debrief him on proper conduct.
[2015/12/03 11:59:45] <Karkus> : )
[2015/12/03 12:00:13] <mt> Karkus: well, notifico isn't set up for flexlay
[2015/12/03 12:00:13] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Please can you show me what 'shows fine' means (with a screenshot)
[2015/12/03 12:00:21] <Karkus> mt: How can I set it up?
[2015/12/03 12:00:23] <mt> and  github's commit bot doesn't announce comments
[2015/12/03 12:00:33] <mt> I can set up an hook URL
[2015/12/03 12:00:41] <mt> and then give it to Tobbi in PM
[2015/12/03 12:00:58] <mt> (or do you happen to have admin access to the flexlay repo)
[2015/12/03 12:01:14] <Karkus> Admin access?
[2015/12/03 12:01:15] <mt> because anyone with access to it could spam the channel using the notifico bots
[2015/12/03 12:01:45] <Karkus> I am a 'Contributor'
[2015/12/03 12:01:54] <brmbrmcar> http://i.cubeupload.com/X0BSYm.png
[2015/12/03 12:02:14] <mt> then you don't have admin access
[2015/12/03 12:02:31] <Tobbi> One moment.
[2015/12/03 12:02:35] <Tobbi> Let me see if Karkus has.
[2015/12/03 12:02:56] <brmbrmcar> Contributor? For what?
[2015/12/03 12:03:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: I added you to the admin group.
[2015/12/03 12:04:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, thanks :D

[2015/12/03 12:19:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yeah, that resource library idea is a minor one... :P
[2015/12/03 12:19:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: Shouldn't be too difficult though.
[2015/12/03 12:19:51] <Tobbi> That's right.
[2015/12/03 12:23:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Should it search the whole data directory?
[2015/12/03 12:24:12] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could search the directories for certain things...data/image for sprite files, data/music for ogg, right?
[2015/12/03 12:24:22] <Tobbi> Is faster than searching data/ fullz.
[2015/12/03 12:24:23] <Tobbi> fully
[2015/12/03 12:24:30] <Karkus> Yep
[2015/12/03 12:25:58] <mt> re people to ping about release I guess that'd also be @amigadave (https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/packager/amigadave/) and possibly @Vincent-C
[2015/12/03 12:27:17] <mt> (https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=Vincent+Cheng) for the latter
[2015/12/03 12:27:20] <Tobbi> mt: Add them to the release issue.
[2015/12/03 12:28:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: Does the game search the datadir for .sprite files?
[2015/12/03 12:28:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, it doesn't. The sprite files are hardcoded within the game.
[2015/12/03 12:29:05] <Tobbi> *sprite file paths
[2015/12/03 12:29:30] <Karkus> Hmmm, okay

[2015/12/03 12:31:19] <Tobbi> mt: Well, you mentioned yourself, did it notify you?
[2015/12/03 12:31:44] <mt> no, that's not expected because I'm watching the repository anyway
[2015/12/03 12:31:56] <mt> and you also don't get a notification for comments you write
[2015/12/03 12:32:04] <Tobbi> right
[2015/12/03 12:35:58] <Karkus> I edited my comment, mt. Did you get an email?
[2015/12/03 12:36:52] <mt> no
[2015/12/03 12:37:16] <Karkus> There you have it, then
[2015/12/03 12:37:32] <mt> if just editing comments generates an email you'd also have gotten one about my change ;)

[2015/12/03 12:55:39] <Tobbi> maths22: If there's a high enough demand for SuperTux on XP, we can create an executable on XP.
[2015/12/03 12:55:45] <Tobbi> But, wait, XP is soo old.
[2015/12/03 12:56:03] <Hume2> ...but better than Windows 7.
[2015/12/03 12:56:04] <mt> if it's more than 'just change one line', forget it?
[2015/12/03 12:56:25] <brmbrmcar> What was always wrong with Vista?
[2015/12/03 12:56:34] <mt> Hume2: I disagree, tbh
[2015/12/03 12:56:52] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Vista is just slow. That's all.
[2015/12/03 12:57:08] <Hume2> However, Windows 7 has IQ 7.
[2015/12/03 12:57:32] <brmbrmcar> All Windows is awful.
[2015/12/03 12:57:38] <maths22> I'm using the IE vms to test the installer on old versions, and started with XP (where it didn't run)
[2015/12/03 12:57:41] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2015/12/03 12:57:57] <maths22> I'm now trying 7.  The good thing is it is a clean install, so I will know if any dependencies are missing
[2015/12/03 12:58:11] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/12/03 12:58:23] <maths22> Tobbi: really, I don't care if it runs in Wine
[2015/12/03 12:58:39] <Tobbi> maths22: That's alright... :D We publish native executables anyway.
[2015/12/03 12:58:43] <maths22> We have native linux builds, so if Wine doesn't like it, its not the end of the world
[2015/12/03 12:58:56] <maths22> Tobbi: exactly
[2015/12/03 12:59:00] <brmbrmcar> Yeah, but I prefer running stuff in Wine on Linux.
[2015/12/03 12:59:12] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: ...
[2015/12/03 12:59:14] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Why do you not like the native builds?
[2015/12/03 12:59:51] <brmbrmcar> I can't seem to ever get the linux ones working, and it uses less disk space.
[2015/12/03 13:00:10] <brmbrmcar> Because on Wine you can just throw away the soycre.
[2015/12/03 13:00:24] <Karkus> I dual boot Windows 10, so I can double check that
[2015/12/03 13:00:28] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Linux builds should not include source [binary ones anyways]
[2015/12/03 13:00:53] <maths22> Karkus: Thanks.  I do the same, but I have all the dev tools installed, so the vms give me a nice clean slate
[2015/12/03 13:01:09] <brmbrmcar> Karku:I mean the thing to install from.
[2015/12/03 13:01:18] <brmbrmcar> I meant maths22 then.
[2015/12/03 13:01:26] <Karkus> maths22: Okay
[2015/12/03 13:01:46] <mt> maths22: uh, builds are usually binaries :P
[2015/12/03 13:01:54] <maths22> mt: I know
[2015/12/03 13:02:03] <Tobbi> Not for something like JavaScript :P
[2015/12/03 13:02:05] <maths22> brmbrmcar was confusing me, and I gave a confusing reply back :(
[2015/12/03 13:02:32] <brmbrmcar> maths22: Where is the Linux source file anyway? You know, that tar.gz one.
[2015/12/03 13:02:47] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Not yet being built.
[2015/12/03 13:02:54] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/12/03 13:03:49] <Tobbi> What is this individual complaining about, anyway? http://a062.apm.etc.tu-bs.de/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=5175#p5175
[2015/12/03 13:03:53] <maths22> I'm dissapointed with the installer.  The background graphics don't work in Windows 7
[2015/12/03 13:04:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: You should announce the new Twitter page on the website
[2015/12/03 13:04:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, yes, I should.
[2015/12/03 13:04:28] <Tobbi> Actually, it needs to be done in the source files as well...

[2015/12/03 13:46:39] <maths22> The current installer creates a system that only works on Windows 10.  That will be fixed tonight
[2015/12/03 13:46:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hmm, what do you mean?
[2015/12/03 13:47:30] <Karkus> What I've tried to do is automatically load all the sprites and badguys
[2015/12/03 13:47:36] <Tobbi> Ah...
[2015/12/03 13:47:42] <Tobbi> wait a minute.
[2015/12/03 13:47:47] <Tobbi> Yes, that's a good idea actually.

[2015/12/03 13:48:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Problem is exactly what you pointed out: Directory names don't correlate with badguy names.
[2015/12/03 13:48:33] <Tobbi> So, unfortunately that part of the code needs to stay intact.
[2015/12/03 13:49:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hmm, so where could I get the names from?
[2015/12/03 13:49:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, it's useless hardcoding it in
[2015/12/03 13:49:38] <Tobbi> right.
[2015/12/03 13:50:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: You could use the directory name...
[2015/12/03 13:50:26] <Tobbi> Seems like that's the only thing that can be used.
[2015/12/03 13:50:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is that always correct?
[2015/12/03 13:51:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, it doesn't need to be correct, right? What I am thinking of when I mean "Sprite library" is a window that has a list of categories (maybe the names of the directory) and on the right it displays the sprites found in that directory.
[2015/12/03 13:51:55] <Tobbi> Maybe I haven't thought this through....
[2015/12/03 13:52:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, when you want to specify a sprite for a badguy, the library opens, you select the sprite and it copies its filename.
[2015/12/03 13:53:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Custom badguys?
[2015/12/03 13:53:18] <Hume2> No, just the sprites.
[2015/12/03 13:53:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, not in terms of behaviour, but in terms of how they look.
[2015/12/03 13:53:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: badguys have a sprite property in the lisp file.
[2015/12/03 13:53:40] <Karkus> Is that a useful thing though?
[2015/12/03 13:53:43] <Tobbi> That defines how the badguy looks...
[2015/12/03 13:53:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't know. But it's better than having to copy the filename to the sprite file, right?
[2015/12/03 13:54:00] <Tobbi> At least IMO
[2015/12/03 13:54:07] <brmbrmcar> There should be something to accept define files indata levels.
[2015/12/03 13:54:54] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: That's a lot of words, but not a lot of sense
[2015/12/03 13:55:05] <brmbrmcar> You know, like .c files.
[2015/12/03 13:55:24] <brmbrmcar> That you can add into like a worldmap.
[2015/12/03 13:56:07] <Tobbi> Oh no.
[2015/12/03 13:56:12] <Tobbi> That would be a huge security risk.
[2015/12/03 13:56:27] <brmbrmcar> Hacking?#
[2015/12/03 13:56:44] <Tobbi> Also, a lot of code overlay...
[2015/12/03 13:56:46] <brmbrmcar> remove Windows
[2015/12/03 13:56:51] <Tobbi> we'd need to integrate a c parser...
[2015/12/03 13:56:52] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: C is a comiled language != scripting
[2015/12/03 13:56:54] <Tobbi> or compiler...
[2015/12/03 13:57:48] <brmbrmcar> How about something that allows more customisability, but not computer destruction.
[2015/12/03 13:59:00] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: We have squirrel, what else do we need?
[2015/12/03 13:59:24] <Tobbi> We should enhance our scripting capabilities after 0.4.0

[2015/12/03 13:59:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: I could have a CSV file in the editor which holds the Label, identifier, and .png/sprite file
[2015/12/03 14:00:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: That would actually make sense. And be much easier to load in.
[2015/12/03 14:00:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes, scripting improvements are a must.

[2015/12/03 14:08:01] <Hume2> It's SuperTux, not DiscoTux :D But I can try.
[2015/12/03 14:12:24] <Tobbi> Hume2: Nah, it's good for post 0.4.0
[2015/12/03 14:12:36] <Tobbi> scripting whatever can be scripted
[2015/12/03 14:14:17] <Hume2> Well, after 0.4.0. There is more important stuff now.
[2015/12/03 14:14:41] <Tobbi> That's right.
[2015/12/03 14:14:47] <Tobbi> Hume2: But scripting is one of these important things.
[2015/12/03 14:15:29] <Hume2> I know, there are more important scripting stuff than disco weather.
[2015/12/03 14:15:49] <brmbrmcar> The invisible wall near the end of Down The Rabbit hole should be replaced.

[2015/12/03 14:50:54] <Hume2> I'd suggest to make only one level a day, else it will look like TeraTux.
[2015/12/03 14:51:50] <Hume2> When I was working on TeraTux, I tried to make 6 levels a day.

[2015/12/03 14:55:42] <Hume2> Making more levels a day is really dangerous. The first time I made some decent levels, but after that it started to bore me.
[2015/12/03 14:56:03] <Tobbi> This will hopefully be improved with the new level editor.
[2015/12/03 14:56:40] <Hume2> ...so the levels were crappier and crappier. After that I was so bored, so I couldn't make any level, even a crappy one.
