[2016/02/01 06:06:52] <Tobbi> Hume2: What's remaining for #342 ?
[2016/02/01 06:12:39] <snadge> i know this is offtopic.. but i just installed extreme tuxracer
[2016/02/01 06:12:51] <Tobbi> snadge: ...and?
[2016/02/01 06:13:01] <snadge> i cant help but feel that it sucks
[2016/02/01 06:13:07] <snadge> lol
[2016/02/01 06:13:23] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/01 06:13:30] <snadge> i've got hours of longevity out of supertux
[2016/02/01 06:13:45] <Tobbi> Oh, 0.7.0 was just release.
[2016/02/01 06:13:48] <Tobbi> d
[2016/02/01 06:13:50] <snadge> its challenging.. fun.. frustrating.. all of these things.. the contributed stuff can be very clever / creative
[2016/02/01 06:13:51] <Tobbi> of extreme tux racer.
[2016/02/01 06:14:09] <snadge> but extreme tux racer.. hmm.. i cant help but feel the mechanics of that game sucks
[2016/02/01 06:14:18] <snadge> and initial impressions are.. there is nothing fun about it
[2016/02/01 06:14:26] <Tobbi> :P Okay, I do get it...
[2016/02/01 06:14:35] <Tobbi> snadge: But SuperTux and the racer are completely different games.
[2016/02/01 06:14:51] <snadge> yeah.. i think i need to see a guide to etracer to see if im playing it wrong or something
[2016/02/01 06:14:56] <snadge> but i just find it very dorky to control
[2016/02/01 06:15:12] <Tobbi> snadge: I think that's the game, really. Last time I tried it was like that as well.
[2016/02/01 06:19:02] <Tobbi> Maybe I should contribute to that instead.
[2016/02/01 06:19:07] <Tobbi> It needs more work than we do.
[2016/02/01 06:19:56] <snadge> a 3d supertux would be better imho
[2016/02/01 06:20:09] <Tobbi> snadge: There is one...Supertux 3D on sourceforge.
[2016/02/01 06:20:09] <snadge> kinda like the 3d mario on the nintendo ds
[2016/02/01 06:20:21] <Tobbi> not maintained by us anyway.
