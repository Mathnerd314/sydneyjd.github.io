[2016/02/01 06:12:39] <snadge> i know this is offtopic.. but i just installed extreme tuxracer
[2016/02/01 06:12:51] <Tobbi> snadge: ...and?
[2016/02/01 06:13:01] <snadge> i cant help but feel that it sucks
[2016/02/01 06:13:07] <snadge> lol
[2016/02/01 06:13:23] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/01 06:13:30] <snadge> i've got hours of longevity out of supertux
[2016/02/01 06:13:45] <Tobbi> Oh, 0.7.0 was just release.
[2016/02/01 06:13:48] <Tobbi> d
[2016/02/01 06:13:50] <snadge> its challenging.. fun.. frustrating.. all of these things.. the contributed stuff can be very clever / creative
[2016/02/01 06:13:51] <Tobbi> of extreme tux racer.
[2016/02/01 06:14:09] <snadge> but extreme tux racer.. hmm.. i cant help but feel the mechanics of that game sucks
[2016/02/01 06:14:18] <snadge> and initial impressions are.. there is nothing fun about it
[2016/02/01 06:14:26] <Tobbi> :P Okay, I do get it...
[2016/02/01 06:14:35] <Tobbi> snadge: But SuperTux and the racer are completely different games.
[2016/02/01 06:14:51] <snadge> yeah.. i think i need to see a guide to etracer to see if im playing it wrong or something
[2016/02/01 06:14:56] <snadge> but i just find it very dorky to control
[2016/02/01 06:15:12] <Tobbi> snadge: I think that's the game, really. Last time I tried it was like that as well.
[2016/02/01 06:19:02] <Tobbi> Maybe I should contribute to that instead.
[2016/02/01 06:19:07] <Tobbi> It needs more work than we do.
[2016/02/01 06:19:56] <snadge> a 3d supertux would be better imho
[2016/02/01 06:20:09] <Tobbi> snadge: There is one...Supertux 3D on sourceforge.
[2016/02/01 06:20:09] <snadge> kinda like the 3d mario on the nintendo ds

[2016/02/01 12:05:10] <brmbrmcar> What happened to Notifico?
[2016/02/01 12:05:17] <mt> it's been replaced

[2016/02/01 12:09:40] <mt> what's wrong with it?
[2016/02/01 12:09:50] <brmbrmcar> I just don't like it.
[2016/02/01 12:10:02] <mt> there has to be a reason for that
[2016/02/01 12:10:04] <brmbrmcar> It sounds and looks awful.
[2016/02/01 12:10:18] <brmbrmcar> It relies on indentation.
[2016/02/01 12:10:50] <mt> proper indentation > everything else :D
[2016/02/01 12:11:00] <mt> >it looks awful
[2016/02/01 12:11:06] <mt> have you seen decorators
[2016/02/01 12:11:07] <brmbrmcar> Yes, butit shouldn't affect code.
[2016/02/01 12:11:35] <mt> it should, because improper indentation will sooner or later lead to a bug because developers won't understand their code
[2016/02/01 12:12:20] <brmbrmcar> I often change indentation to what seems best.
[2016/02/01 12:13:04] <mt> 4 characters wide, spaces; what Python uses and what is best for everything
[2016/02/01 12:14:48] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I suggest to you: Brain****.

[2016/02/01 15:21:32] <Hume2> There are double letters ecen in Czech, but for some reason.
[2016/02/01 15:22:45] <Hume2> It's only when a sufix ends on the same letter as the root begins or similar situations.
[2016/02/01 15:23:01] <brmbrmcar> Sufix?
[2016/02/01 15:23:03] <brmbrmcar> LOL
[2016/02/01 15:23:10] <Hume2> Prefix
[2016/02/01 15:23:20] <Hume2> My mistake.
[2016/02/01 15:23:31] <brmbrmcar> No,the spelling of sufix.
[2016/02/01 15:24:00] <Hume2> How is it then? Suffix?
[2016/02/01 15:24:30] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/01 15:24:37] <brmbrmcar> I think.
[2016/02/01 15:25:15] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/01 15:26:22] <Hume2> Can this be a [ci skip]? I'm not sure.
[2016/02/01 15:26:29] <brmbrmcar> Wht be?
[2016/02/01 15:26:49] <Hume2> That grammar and formating fix.
[2016/02/01 15:27:06] <brmbrmcar> Is it in /src?
[2016/02/01 15:27:26] <Hume2> Yes, it is.
[2016/02/01 15:27:31] <brmbrmcar> I'd be onthe safe side.
[2016/02/01 15:28:13] <Hume2> I think so. Eventually the next build will test it.
[2016/02/01 15:29:22] <Tobbi> Hume2: It can. Just make sure it compiles locally.
[2016/02/01 15:30:15] <Tobbi> It can be expected that whatever compiled before will also compile afterwards.

[2016/02/02 06:29:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: By the way: If a member function calls the exact same member function of the base class, it is obsolete, isn't it?
[2016/02/02 06:36:25] <Hume2> Tobbi: Indeed, it is.
[2016/02/02 06:36:43] <Tobbi> Hume2: Let me look through the code for any occurrences...
[2016/02/02 06:41:27] <Tobbi> Hume2: I wonder whether we should have a const version of the collision_* functions...
[2016/02/02 06:41:59] <Hume2> Tobbi: It has something to do with the objects.
[2016/02/02 06:42:18] <Hume2> For example there the on_ground flag is updated.
[2016/02/02 06:43:14] <Hume2> The const is only for functions those don't modify the object variables, right?
[2016/02/02 06:43:20] <Tobbi> Hume2: Exactly.
[2016/02/02 06:43:35] <Hume2> So they can't be const, I think.
[2016/02/02 06:44:04] <Tobbi> Hume2: If they only return FORCE_MOVE; they can.
[2016/02/02 06:44:10] <Tobbi> (some do that)
[2016/02/02 06:44:45] <Hume2> Yes, but is that possible, even when the function in the parent calss isn't const?
[2016/02/02 06:46:18] <Tobbi> Hume2: You know that you can have "collision_solid()" and "collision_solid() const" both in the same class.
[2016/02/02 06:46:51] <Tobbi> Oh, wait!
[2016/02/02 06:46:53] <Tobbi> Can we?
[2016/02/02 06:46:56] <Tobbi> I don't know.
[2016/02/02 06:53:23] <Tobbi> Hume2: What do we do about this scripting interface thing...?
[2016/02/02 06:53:33] <Tobbi> Scripting interface is not safe from memory access violations.
[2016/02/02 06:53:45] <Hume2> Hmmm...
[2016/02/02 06:54:00] <Tobbi> I kind of have an idea...
[2016/02/02 06:54:04] <Tobbi> But I need to think this through.
[2016/02/02 06:54:37] <Tobbi> Hume2: We need to change create_wrapper.cpp and add NULL checks.
[2016/02/02 06:54:49] <Hume2> I'll look
[2016/02/02 06:57:12] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2016/02/02 06:57:14] <Tobbi> I got it.
[2016/02/02 07:06:06] <Tobbi> I probably fixed it.

[2016/02/02 10:09:53] <Tobbi> I think this might be easier than using the text file approach.
[2016/02/02 10:10:03] <sydney_untangle> Hrm.
[2016/02/02 10:10:09] <sydney_untangle> Well, you can do it. :)
[2016/02/02 10:10:29] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: If I had a spare SD card, I could do it on my rbpi-
[2016/02/02 10:10:32] <Tobbi> But I don't have one.
[2016/02/02 10:10:45] <Tobbi> I could technically shutdown my rbpi, dump the sd card contents to my HDD...and then try it.
[2016/02/02 10:10:59] <Tobbi> But that wouldn't be a permanent solution.
[2016/02/02 10:11:39] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I just don't want something uploading to github constantly.
[2016/02/02 10:11:45] <sydney_untangle> 5 mins it more often than i like.
[2016/02/02 10:11:58] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Hrm...you're right. It's actually not that much of a good solution.
[2016/02/02 10:12:08] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: So, there we know what you can send me: A rbpi.
[2016/02/02 10:12:11] <Tobbi> (a second one)
[2016/02/02 10:12:13] <Tobbi> With SD card...
[2016/02/02 10:12:20] <sydney_untangle> Hehe.
[2016/02/02 10:12:32] <Tobbi> Currently, mine runs openelec.
[2016/02/02 10:12:38] <Tobbi> Although I don't use that very often.
[2016/02/02 10:12:41] <sydney_untangle> I dont have one myself, so why would i get you a second one? :p
[2016/02/02 10:13:05] <sydney_untangle> I have a beast of an old desktop that you can have if you will pay shipping. :D
[2016/02/02 10:13:21] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Sorry, have that myself. What does your logger run on?
[2016/02/02 10:13:38] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Another beast of an old desktop. ;)
[2016/02/02 10:13:43] <Tobbi> I see...
[2016/02/02 10:13:57] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: rbpi would probably be less resource-wasting...
[2016/02/02 10:14:04] <sydney_untangle> Not the nicest to the electric bill... but...
[2016/02/02 10:14:08] <sydney_untangle> Meh. :p
[2016/02/02 10:14:21] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: But i cannot hook 4 HDDs to a RPI.
[2016/02/02 10:14:39] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Why would you want to do that, anyway?
[2016/02/02 10:14:48] <Tobbi> Also, you can, if the power supply is strong enough, I guess.
[2016/02/02 10:14:54] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I use my server for backups and such.
[2016/02/02 10:14:57] <Tobbi> I see...

[2016/02/02 10:16:38] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: oh god.
[2016/02/02 10:16:42] <sydney_untangle> And it is my IRC client, my logger and red_bot's host.
[2016/02/02 10:16:56] <Tobbi> Okay, I will probably dump my SD card content to disk.
[2016/02/02 10:17:08] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: lol.
[2016/02/02 10:17:16] <sydney_untangle> Yeah, this thing is not being replaced...
[2016/02/02 10:17:31] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I want to try out botbot without jeopardizing my system.
[2016/02/02 10:17:37] <sydney_untangle> I'd buy a router with USB support before a RPI.
[2016/02/02 10:17:45] <sydney_untangle> Use a VM or something?
[2016/02/02 10:19:37] <sydney_untangle> Hrm... what else do i do with my server, oh yes, i use it as a NAS as well.

[2016/02/02 10:22:04] <Tobbi> Oh, yeah, a VM might work.
[2016/02/02 10:24:14] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: What else do you want my server to do? :p Im thinking of installing owncloud on it, but it won't be of much use if i cannot access it from outside of my home network...
[2016/02/02 10:24:41] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: That's true. I tried installing OwnCloud on my rbpi...performance was...urgh.
[2016/02/02 10:25:17] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: hehe.
[2016/02/02 10:25:24] <sydney_untangle> This has a little more resources. ;)
[2016/02/02 10:25:54] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I'd also like to install PFSense, except its BSD. o_O
[2016/02/02 10:26:01] <Tobbi> PFSense_
[2016/02/02 10:28:12] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: What's PFSense?

[2016/02/02 12:27:18] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I guess google would then hire me for sure.
[2016/02/02 12:28:04] * sydney_untangle gives up...
[2016/02/02 12:28:30] <brmbrmcar> A GPS isn't that much aroundhere.
[2016/02/02 12:28:30] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: What about giving me a new raspberry pi instead of "up"?

[2016/02/02 12:29:43] <mt> I didn't want to annoy you with a highlight :P
[2016/02/02 12:30:10] <brmbrmcar> Is that meantto be a ??
[2016/02/02 12:30:18] <Hume2> o-umlaut

[2016/02/02 12:30:41] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: LOL, I could buy myself 300 from the salary I'd get from a potential investor.
[2016/02/02 12:30:47] <brmbrmcar> Fine.

[2016/02/02 12:31:26] <brmbrmcar> I looked itup.
[2016/02/02 12:31:47] <Tobbi> mt: Would you be willing to host botbot instead of me?
[2016/02/02 12:31:56] <Tobbi> Botbot is actually better than this damn text file...
[2016/02/02 12:32:21] <brmbrmcar> A new botis coming?

[2016/02/02 12:35:06] <mt> hm, still have an almost-idle server in US-LAX

[2016/02/02 12:36:58] <mt> irssi + cronjob calling git, I guess
[2016/02/02 12:37:14] <mt> on that US-LAX server
[2016/02/02 12:37:24] <mt> I could probably host daily txt logs
[2016/02/02 12:37:24] <Tobbi> mt: How much do you pay for your servers anyway?
[2016/02/02 12:37:27] <mt> or monthly
[2016/02/02 12:37:31] <sydney_untangle> A cronjob copying the logs to a specified folder then uploading to github with git.
[2016/02/02 12:37:58] <brmbrmcar> irssi isn't involved.
[2016/02/02 12:38:09] <brmbrmcar> red_bot does it.
[2016/02/02 12:38:09] <sydney_untangle> Nope.
[2016/02/02 12:38:22] <sydney_untangle> red_bot does the logging itself.
[2016/02/02 12:38:31] <mt> Tobbi: 10 USD/month for my server in UK-LON (1 GB RAM, KVM), 0 USD/month for the US-LAX server (128 MB RAM, OpenVZ)
[2016/02/02 12:38:36] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: So this is how people make those crappy apps. http://mashable.com/2013/12/03/build-mobile-apps/
[2016/02/02 12:39:15] <mt> for the latter server, I however have access to an admin webfrontend that lets me create more containers on the same host machine
[2016/02/02 12:39:42] <Tobbi> :)
[2016/02/02 12:40:39] <sydney_untangle> mt: What is US-LAX?
[2016/02/02 12:40:55] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: That is a US american who is lactose-intolerant.

[2016/02/02 12:42:03] <Tobbi> We can meet up :P
[2016/02/02 12:42:25] <Tobbi> ...and you can bring the raspberry pis you promised me :P
[2016/02/02 12:43:19] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Will you have that app coded? :D
[2016/02/02 12:43:31] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Probably not, but I'd pretend I do.
[2016/02/02 12:43:40] <sydney_untangle> ...

[2016/02/02 12:46:49] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I am not the first person who wants to be able to have beaming technology or warp technology, either. Yet, no one has invented stuff in that aspect.
[2016/02/02 12:48:00] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: This isn't so complicated. :p
[2016/02/02 12:48:06] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Who knows...
[2016/02/02 12:48:12] <mt> In theory you can teleport objects over a maximum distance of ~144 km
[2016/02/02 12:48:24] <Hume2> For flat terrain it's not as hard.
[2016/02/02 12:48:34] <mt> However, you need very much energy
[2016/02/02 12:48:38] <Hume2> However, tell me which field is totally flat.
[2016/02/02 12:48:50] <Tobbi> mt: And if we teleport humans, they'd likely be dead then, won't they?
[2016/02/02 12:49:04] <mt> most likely
[2016/02/02 12:49:13] <brmbrmcar> To much FORCE
[2016/02/02 12:49:14] <mt> if we made progress, they'd only have cancer
[2016/02/02 12:49:20] <brmbrmcar> s/To/Too/
[2016/02/02 12:49:20] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "Too much FORCE"
[2016/02/02 12:49:31] <Hume2> cancer :D
[2016/02/02 12:49:49] <brmbrmcar> Teleporting is impossible.
[2016/02/02 12:50:01] <Hume2> It's like 3D printer :D
[2016/02/02 12:50:06] <brmbrmcar> JUst moving too quickly for systems to pickup movement.
[2016/02/02 12:51:07] <Hume2> If we teleported the signal across the computer, we could have faster computers.
[2016/02/02 12:51:49] <brmbrmcar> What is this teleporting rubbish?
[2016/02/02 12:52:14] <brmbrmcar> Do I have a different definition of teleport?
[2016/02/02 12:52:41] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Teleport != Airport you see on TV.
[2016/02/02 12:52:44] * sydney_untangle cries...
[2016/02/02 12:52:53] * Hume2 teleports
[2016/02/02 12:53:05] <mt> Hume2: I wonder why no one has yet created network interfaces using quantum technology
[2016/02/02 12:53:26] <Hume2> It's too expensive I think.
[2016/02/02 12:53:31] <mt> like I mean this thing that specifies that if you change something with one particle, the other will react too, faster than light
[2016/02/02 12:53:40] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2016/02/02 12:53:45] <mt> That would allow us to have a global maximum latency of 0 ms
[2016/02/02 12:54:10] <Hume2> I think that Microsoft needs such speed :P
[2016/02/02 12:54:23] <Tobbi> mt: How far are we art implementing that? Is there a proposal?
[2016/02/02 12:54:31] <Tobbi> s/art/with
[2016/02/02 12:54:32] <Tobbi> s/art/with/
[2016/02/02 12:54:32] <red_bot> Tobbi meant: "s/with/with"
[2016/02/02 12:54:36] <mt> no
[2016/02/02 12:54:46] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/02/02 12:54:47] <brmbrmcar> These quantum technologies are VERY far into the future.

[2016/02/02 12:58:12] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Having no money would ruin the world as well.
[2016/02/02 12:58:12] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/02 12:58:41] <Hume2> I think that the money is now just a couple of numbers.

[2016/02/02 13:04:10] <mt> brmbrmcar: (italic doesn't display as well here, it's probably because there's no italic fontface of this family)
[2016/02/02 13:04:17] <brmbrmcar> OK
[2016/02/02 13:04:25] <Hume2> If you copy it to an editor with a proportional charset, it should display correctly.

[2016/02/02 13:16:54] <mt> however
[2016/02/02 13:17:02] <mt> I'd generally suggest +S (SSL-only)
[2016/02/02 13:17:07] <Tobbi> talk to you guys later.
[2016/02/02 13:17:14] <brmbrmcar> How do you use SSL?
[2016/02/02 13:17:17] <mt> SSL-only because http://www.charybdis.io/2016/01/30/charybdis-and-ircv3-3-sts.html
[2016/02/02 13:17:32] <mt> brmbrmcar: you configure your client to use it, duh

[2016/02/02 13:18:24] <brmbrmcar> You  just enable SSL?

[2016/02/02 13:19:05] <brmbrmcar> How do I automate that.
[2016/02/02 13:19:07] <brmbrmcar> ?
[2016/02/02 13:19:19] <mt> automate?
[2016/02/02 13:19:27] <mt> if you /save in irssi
[2016/02/02 13:19:33] <mt> it will keep the configuration
[2016/02/02 13:19:38] <mt> after restarts
[2016/02/02 13:19:46] <brmbrmcar> And that will replace the old one?
[2016/02/02 13:19:55] <mt> what old one?
[2016/02/02 13:20:02] <brmbrmcar> THeone I have on now.
[2016/02/02 13:20:09] <mt> what is the one?
[2016/02/02 13:20:11] <brmbrmcar> But I saved it differently.
[2016/02/02 13:20:21] <brmbrmcar> THe auto-conection.
[2016/02/02 13:20:43] <mt> brmbrmcar: the ssl options also work for /server
[2016/02/02 13:20:49] <mt> which is, after /save, permanent
[2016/02/02 13:20:56] <sydney_untangle> So, here is a question. My grandma has a laptop with UEFI, but i would like to wipe it and install debian on it, but im wondering if its that simple. I have secure boot turned off.
[2016/02/02 13:20:56] <brmbrmcar> Shall I just run it?
[2016/02/02 13:21:02] <mt> and
[2016/02/02 13:21:04] <mt> 19:20     When using the ADD parameter on a server that already exists, the
[2016/02/02 13:21:07] <mt> 19:20     configuration will be merged with each other.
[2016/02/02 13:21:10] <mt> see /help server
[2016/02/02 13:21:28] <mt> you obviously then need to reconnect to make the change effective
[2016/02/02 13:22:01] <brmbrmcar> I did that, just runs freenode2.
[2016/02/02 13:22:14] <brmbrmcar> No SASL even
[2016/02/02 13:22:44] <brmbrmcar> Nothing.
[2016/02/02 13:22:45] <sydney_untangle> Do any of you have one of these machines with UEFI?
[2016/02/02 13:23:30] @ Quit: brmbrmcar: Quit: restart
[2016/02/02 13:23:47] <mt> I have an UEFI mainboard, don't know if it's a proper implementation though
[2016/02/02 13:23:57] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/02 13:24:19] <mt> proper implementation = rm -rf /sys/firmare/efi is recoverable
[2016/02/02 13:24:26] <sydney_untangle> Not fun... I like the good old bios.
[2016/02/02 13:24:33] <mt> UEFI <3
[2016/02/02 13:24:38] <mt> if properly implemented
[2016/02/02 13:24:41] <mt> I mean heh
[2016/02/02 13:24:42] <sydney_untangle> True.
[2016/02/02 13:24:47] <mt> you can boot without bootloader
[2016/02/02 13:25:04] <mt> folks, DON'T RUN THAT RM COMMAND ABOVE
[2016/02/02 13:25:22] <sydney_untangle> lol. ;)

[2016/02/02 14:33:39] <Hume2> Finally done.
[2016/02/02 14:34:07] <Hume2> When it's 8×10, the dpi doesn't matter.
[2016/02/02 14:34:54] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2016/02/02 14:36:08] <Hume2> It's just a couople of black and white squares.
[2016/02/02 14:36:30] <Hume2> When ecah square was 1px, the result would be the same.
[2016/02/02 14:36:49] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 14:37:46] <brmbrmcar> What did you jus do?
[2016/02/02 14:38:21] <Hume2> The chessboard.
[2016/02/02 14:39:00] <brmbrmcar> It took a long time then.
[2016/02/02 14:39:09] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/02 14:39:22] <brmbrmcar> Our laser is very qick.
[2016/02/02 14:39:31] <brmbrmcar> Never used it myself.
[2016/02/02 14:40:05] <Hume2> It was printed quickly, but putting it all together toke so long time.
[2016/02/02 14:40:34] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2016/02/02 14:40:50] <brmbrmcar> Was there a large border then?
[2016/02/02 14:41:32] <Hume2> Not large, but there was on echa page.
[2016/02/02 14:41:38] <Hume2> *each
[2016/02/02 14:42:06] <brmbrmcar> Did you hide it?
[2016/02/02 14:42:20] <Hume2> No, I cut it off.
[2016/02/02 14:42:55] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2016/02/02 14:43:02] <Hume2> I'll write the coordinates on the tiles at the edges.
[2016/02/02 14:43:02] <brmbrmcar> Easier to play.
[2016/02/02 14:43:07] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 14:44:11] <brmbrmcar> I want a giant printer, and then to stick a load of pages together.#
[2016/02/02 14:44:24] <brmbrmcar> It would be super-giant more quickly.
[2016/02/02 14:44:32] <brmbrmcar> 4913x4913.
[2016/02/02 14:44:35] <Hume2> :D That I'd like too.
[2016/02/02 14:45:49] <brmbrmcar> How long would that ake with A4?
[2016/02/02 14:46:14] <Hume2> I'll calculate it.
[2016/02/02 14:46:56] <Hume2> It would be 302580 pages. o.O
[2016/02/02 14:47:07] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 14:48:02] <brmbrmcar> I want it!
[2016/02/02 14:48:16] <brmbrmcar> I need a load of paper.
[2016/02/02 14:48:26] <Hume2> And ink :D
[2016/02/02 14:48:33] @ swift110_ joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/02 14:48:55] <brmbrmcar> A lot of ink.
[2016/02/02 14:49:11] <Hume2> I have a lot of paper, but not even 302580 pages.
[2016/02/02 14:49:14] <brmbrmcar> Iwaste ink at school deliberately.
[2016/02/02 14:49:37] <Hume2> I too.
[2016/02/02 14:49:37] <brmbrmcar> I just extract ink fromthere.
[2016/02/02 14:50:01] <Hume2> I usually draw useless drawings.
[2016/02/02 14:50:10] <brmbrmcar> The only disadvantage is I can't eat it afterwards.
[2016/02/02 14:50:20] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 14:50:38] <brmbrmcar> I scribble over the school logos in tests.
[2016/02/02 14:50:44] <Hume2> I try to not waste it, but it's hard.
[2016/02/02 14:50:47] <brmbrmcar> Internal tests.
[2016/02/02 14:50:55] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2016/02/02 14:50:59] @ bb010g_ joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/02 14:51:07] <Hume2> Yeah, tests.
[2016/02/02 14:51:09] @ Quit: bb010g: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2016/02/02 14:51:39] <brmbrmcar> I always draw a hedgehog too.
[2016/02/02 14:51:40] <Hume2> I used to store them for insane long time, but now I use them as a paper that is used from one side.
[2016/02/02 14:51:46] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 14:52:08] <Hume2> My drawings are something abstract usually.
[2016/02/02 14:52:31] @ bb010g_ is now known as bb010g
[2016/02/02 14:52:32] <Hume2> Or i edit the text to make something funny :D
[2016/02/02 14:53:23] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 14:53:39] <Hume2> Minor edits can change the meaning rapidly.
[2016/02/02 14:53:46] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 14:54:04] <brmbrmcar> If Imake anerror tjough,I just scribble it right out.
[2016/02/02 14:54:27] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/02 14:54:31] <brmbrmcar> Maybe I should just change the meaning, and lave it.
[2016/02/02 14:54:41] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 14:54:47] <brmbrmcar> Ijust right "brm brm car" over it.
[2016/02/02 14:54:57] <brmbrmcar> HIdes all gaps.
[2016/02/02 14:55:12] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 14:55:39] <Hume2> I usually turn some sentences to negative.
[2016/02/02 14:55:45] <brmbrmcar> Or what I meant to put.
[2016/02/02 14:55:46] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 14:56:55] <Hume2> Sometimes there's a form on the other side, not relevent to the test, so I fill in some nonsenses.
[2016/02/02 14:57:29] <brmbrmcar> I do that with proper, serious parts.
[2016/02/02 14:57:48] <brmbrmcar> I shouldn't but it tests the strictness of marking.
[2016/02/02 14:58:13] <Hume2> I've once done it with tax return :D
[2016/02/02 14:58:21] <Hume2> Not mine :D
[2016/02/02 14:58:36] <brmbrmcar> :D

[2016/02/02 14:59:44] <Hume2> When there's a form where they were supposed to tick A B C or D, I puth there an E and tick it.
[2016/02/02 15:00:16] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:00:48] <brmbrmcar> They seem to drop that thing aroun here.
[2016/02/02 15:00:58] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/02 15:01:14] <brmbrmcar> Probably a pathetixc attempt to stop cheating.
[2016/02/02 15:01:53] <Hume2> Maybe.
[2016/02/02 15:02:17] <Hume2> I think that they should allow to cheat, because noone remembers all those ᑎ̲.
[2016/02/02 15:02:37] <Hume2> Well, some students do.
[2016/02/02 15:02:39] <brmbrmcar> Wit for the ,ogs then.
[2016/02/02 15:03:29] <brmbrmcar> I like voiding my work.
[2016/02/02 15:04:11] <Hume2> I too, sometimes.
[2016/02/02 15:04:34] <Hume2> I have a collection of paper boats made of English tests :D
[2016/02/02 15:04:41] <brmbrmcar> Once I din't want to take part in this competition, so I said I was zero.
[2016/02/02 15:04:49] <brmbrmcar> I don't try that.
[2016/02/02 15:05:21] <brmbrmcar> Some peopke will accept that if you give it too them to mark.
[2016/02/02 15:05:32] <Hume2> "The competitions are always won by someone else."
[2016/02/02 15:05:57] <brmbrmcar> It doesn't say "don't make this into a boat," does it?
[2016/02/02 15:06:11] <Hume2> No, it doesn't.
[2016/02/02 15:06:31] <brmbrmcar> There is no definition of anything.
[2016/02/02 15:06:36] <Hume2> Once we had to return that test, but I had already made that boat.
[2016/02/02 15:06:49] <brmbrmcar> That is not really void, but most will say so. :D
[2016/02/02 15:06:57] <brmbrmcar> Any trouble?
[2016/02/02 15:07:04] <Hume2> Not really.
[2016/02/02 15:07:21] <Hume2> The teacher was just a bit annoyed.
[2016/02/02 15:07:31] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2016/02/02 15:08:18] <Hume2> I usually void those small tests.
[2016/02/02 15:08:24] <brmbrmcar> Oh yes.
[2016/02/02 15:08:44] <Hume2> I write some temporary notes on it and then i throw it away.
[2016/02/02 15:08:53] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:09:28] <brmbrmcar> I cheat those.
[2016/02/02 15:09:38] <brmbrmcar> Well, I did once.
[2016/02/02 15:09:57] <Hume2> it's strange, but I've never cheated.
[2016/02/02 15:10:32] <Hume2> I don't have "good" marks, but still good enoug to pass.
[2016/02/02 15:10:54] <brmbrmcar> Sometimes, even when it seems formal,there is a break in between taking the test.
[2016/02/02 15:11:19] <brmbrmcar> I just know how to take the advantages.
[2016/02/02 15:11:54] <Hume2> i never had a break in between taking the test.
[2016/02/02 15:12:10] <brmbrmcar> Well, that's my school.
[2016/02/02 15:12:16] <brmbrmcar> So informal.
[2016/02/02 15:12:39] <brmbrmcar> Except on pointless things.
[2016/02/02 15:12:49] <Hume2> That makes sense.
[2016/02/02 15:13:18] <Hume2> I hate how they torture us with ᑎ̲.
[2016/02/02 15:13:29] <brmbrmcar> What?
[2016/02/02 15:13:40] <brmbrmcar> Describe the symbol.
[2016/02/02 15:13:53] <Hume2> The same symbol again.
[2016/02/02 15:13:59] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2016/02/02 15:14:16] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:14:28] <brmbrmcar> What do you mean?
[2016/02/02 15:14:54] <Hume2> I mean the most of biology.
[2016/02/02 15:15:21] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2016/02/02 15:16:25] <Hume2> You know, recognizing what kind of organism is what.
[2016/02/02 15:17:01] <Hume2> I just want to know what is edible, that would be enough.
[2016/02/02 15:17:07] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:17:59] <brmbrmcar> It is soboring.
[2016/02/02 15:18:08] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/02 15:19:18] <brmbrmcar> I never got those cells things.
[2016/02/02 15:19:35] <brmbrmcar> I just messed it up.
[2016/02/02 15:19:41] <Hume2> It's useless for the most of students.
[2016/02/02 15:21:39] <brmbrmcar> Yes,
[2016/02/02 15:22:04] <brmbrmcar> Jusyt learnit later.
[2016/02/02 15:22:23] <Hume2> I wouldn't learn it even later :D
[2016/02/02 15:22:57] <Hume2> When I don't know, I just type something.
[2016/02/02 15:23:37] <Hume2> Question: Where lives <some kind of fish>?
[2016/02/02 15:23:47] <Hume2> Answer: In the water.
[2016/02/02 15:23:59] <brmbrmcar> Correct!
[2016/02/02 15:24:18] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 15:24:46] <brmbrmcar> Top of the class is Hume2, with 1 out of 1 correct!
[2016/02/02 15:24:52] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 15:25:13] <Hume2> Question: Can the biggest shark eat a human? And why?
[2016/02/02 15:25:27] <Hume2> Answer: Yes, I've seen it in TV.
[2016/02/02 15:25:39] <Hume2> It wans't correct though.
[2016/02/02 15:25:49] <brmbrmcar> I guess not.
[2016/02/02 15:25:52] <brmbrmcar> 1 mark.
[2016/02/02 15:25:59] <brmbrmcar> The why was wrog.
[2016/02/02 15:26:26] <Hume2> Those why questions are something annoying in biology.
[2016/02/02 15:26:44] <Hume2> Once I've answered: Because the god has made it that way.
[2016/02/02 15:26:50] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:27:27] <brmbrmcar> They are bad questions.
[2016/02/02 15:28:02] <Hume2> I heard that there was a cell and a rabit and question: Which of these have only one cell? And why?
[2016/02/02 15:28:34] <Hume2> He didn't know what to answer on that why, so I adviced him to answer:
[2016/02/02 15:28:41] <Hume2> It was once in TV.
[2016/02/02 15:28:45] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:29:37] <brmbrmcar> I currently keep being asked "Why do plants do photosynthesis?" GRRR
[2016/02/02 15:29:47] <brmbrmcar> For fu.
[2016/02/02 15:29:50] <brmbrmcar> n
[2016/02/02 15:29:52] <Hume2> Terrible question.
[2016/02/02 15:30:07] <brmbrmcar> Seems more likely.
[2016/02/02 15:30:58] <Hume2> I think that the teacher doesn't want to know why, but what it causes.
[2016/02/02 15:31:27] <brmbrmcar> Oxegen, glucose. Apparently.
[2016/02/02 15:31:48] <Hume2> Or isn't the answer: Because it contains cholophyle?
[2016/02/02 15:32:01] <Hume2> *chlorophyle or how it is.
[2016/02/02 15:32:10] <brmbrmcar> Yes, maybe.
[2016/02/02 15:32:16] <brmbrmcar> I don't know.
[2016/02/02 15:32:36] <Hume2> There are some questions those answers are illogical.
[2016/02/02 15:32:42] <brmbrmcar> Yes,
[2016/02/02 15:32:53] <Hume2> You just have to learn what answer belongs to which question.
[2016/02/02 15:33:14] <Hume2> Even when it doesn't make any sense.
[2016/02/02 15:33:24] <brmbrmcar> I always mess this up.
[2016/02/02 15:33:40] <Hume2> I mess this up too.
[2016/02/02 15:33:44] <brmbrmcar> THere is always a range of excuses why I got marked wrong.
[2016/02/02 15:33:46] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2016/02/02 15:34:28] <Hume2> Yes, even when the excuses don't make it any better.
[2016/02/02 15:34:52] <Hume2> Usually.
[2016/02/02 15:34:53] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:35:54] <brmbrmcar> And in the last test there was one seriously bad question.
[2016/02/02 15:36:14] <Hume2> go on
[2016/02/02 15:37:01] <brmbrmcar> THere was a radiator.
[2016/02/02 15:37:29] <brmbrmcar> It was rated lets say 6 kW (I can't remember)
[2016/02/02 15:37:54] <brmbrmcar> Energy costs 12p or whatever perkWh.
[2016/02/02 15:38:14] <brmbrmcar> How much does it cost for 12 hours?
[2016/02/02 15:38:31] <Hume2> Oh, these questions.
[2016/02/02 15:38:55] <brmbrmcar> Seems alright, but the answer was apparently 864 kWh.
[2016/02/02 15:39:08] <Hume2> LOL
[2016/02/02 15:39:10] <brmbrmcar> Ah, 862p.
[2016/02/02 15:39:14] <brmbrmcar> 864.
[2016/02/02 15:39:19] <brmbrmcar> Sorry.
[2016/02/02 15:39:28] <Hume2> That's weird.
[2016/02/02 15:39:30] <brmbrmcar> Irt still doesn't make sense
[2016/02/02 15:39:57] <Hume2> And 8 Pounds 64p was incorrect, I guess.
[2016/02/02 15:40:18] <brmbrmcar> THe answer would work if it was 6kWh rated, and it didn't say tat.
[2016/02/02 15:40:53] <brmbrmcar> I ened up with a crazy answer.
[2016/02/02 15:41:07] <Hume2> Yes, it's a crazy question.
[2016/02/02 15:42:01] <brmbrmcar> And they give out these books with even crazier stuff.
[2016/02/02 15:42:16] <Hume2> Yeah, no wonder.
[2016/02/02 15:43:18] <brmbrmcar> They cost money!
[2016/02/02 15:43:54] <Hume2> Yes, but the content is almost the same as in the older books.
[2016/02/02 15:44:43] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:44:55] <brmbrmcar> JUst updated for the new test things.
[2016/02/02 15:45:26] <Hume2> That makes sense, because it changes frequently.
[2016/02/02 15:46:16] <Hume2> I'm not even talking about that it's somewere in the Internet, bazilion times.
[2016/02/02 15:46:24] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:46:39] <brmbrmcar> I didn't want it.
[2016/02/02 15:47:03] <Hume2> Yes, but it's not possible to get rid of it.
[2016/02/02 15:47:25] <Hume2> Many people working at the press would lost their jobs.
[2016/02/02 15:47:43] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:47:57] <Hume2> This and many other reasons.
[2016/02/02 15:48:29] <brmbrmcar> I hate when they make you pau for these things.
[2016/02/02 15:48:49] <Hume2> I hate that too.
[2016/02/02 15:48:57] <brmbrmcar> It's a stste school!
[2016/02/02 15:49:22] <Hume2> They could just tell the links where to get that info for free.
[2016/02/02 15:49:54] <brmbrmcar> And in art, you have to splash out the equivalent of around ?2.00 on a terrible scrap book.
[2016/02/02 15:50:03] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:50:08] <brmbrmcar> They should!
[2016/02/02 15:50:18] <brmbrmcar> Or, photocopy it. :D
[2016/02/02 15:50:38] <Hume2> :D However, you know, all those officiers losing their jobs.
[2016/02/02 15:51:12] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:51:17] <brmbrmcar> Jobs.

[2016/02/02 15:51:37] <Hume2> You know, all the army of officiers.
[2016/02/02 15:51:58] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:52:13] <brmbrmcar> They need jobs, I do guess.
[2016/02/02 15:52:30] <Hume2> Indeed. And they are willing to fight.
[2016/02/02 15:53:11] * brmbrmcar is scared
[2016/02/02 15:53:16] <brmbrmcar> THey really?
[2016/02/02 15:53:37] <Hume2> No, like law-fighting.
[2016/02/02 15:53:57] <Hume2> They will find something that you did wrong and blame you.
[2016/02/02 15:54:16] <brmbrmcar> That scares me.
[2016/02/02 15:54:24] <brmbrmcar> Court?
[2016/02/02 15:54:29] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:54:57] <Hume2> They also have money, so they pay someone to make you trouble.
[2016/02/02 15:55:15] <brmbrmcar> I hate the idea of court.
[2016/02/02 15:55:29] <brmbrmcar> Several hours, trying to defend yourself.
[2016/02/02 15:55:48] <Hume2> I was never at it, so I can't say.
[2016/02/02 15:56:14] <brmbrmcar> I haven't either.
[2016/02/02 15:56:56] <Hume2> Also when the office is big enough, its productivity is more like zero.
[2016/02/02 15:57:19] <Tobbi> great, no space left on device (again)
[2016/02/02 15:57:26] <Hume2> Because the officiers solve mainly the problem of the office itself.
[2016/02/02 15:57:48] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:57:53] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 15:59:09] <Hume2> In the worst case it also damages the stuff arround.
[2016/02/02 16:00:01] <brmbrmcar> Like what?
[2016/02/02 16:00:46] <Hume2> I mean that the activity they think that is good, is bad for most people.
[2016/02/02 16:01:10] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2016/02/02 16:01:21] <brmbrmcar> I agree.
[2016/02/02 16:02:40] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Want to teach me how to code an android app? :p
[2016/02/02 16:02:48] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: No.
[2016/02/02 16:03:10] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Unless you want to program "Add-Ommmm" as an android app.
[2016/02/02 16:03:31] <sydney_untangle> lol.
[2016/02/02 16:03:46] <Hume2> Add-Ommmm :D
[2016/02/02 16:06:34] <brmbrmcar> What is Add-0mmmm?
[2016/02/02 16:09:40] <sydney_untangle> brmbrmcar: A app you can code for me.
[2016/02/02 16:09:40] <Tobbi> You guys don't want to know.
[2016/02/02 16:10:15] <Tobbi> Hume2, brmbrmcar, sydney_untangle: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/addommmm/?src=search
[2016/02/02 16:11:23] <Hume2> :D I'll try it.
[2016/02/02 16:11:30] <Tobbi> Hume2: Doesn't work on recent firefox versions.
[2016/02/02 16:11:36] <Tobbi> I should update it.
[2016/02/02 16:12:12] <Hume2> That's a shame.
[2016/02/02 16:12:44] <Tobbi> Hume2: If you want, study the code and update it. It should be on my github.
[2016/02/02 16:13:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: https://github.com/tobbi/AddOmmmm
[2016/02/02 16:14:29] <Hume2> It was quite fast to make it, wasn't it?
[2016/02/02 16:14:37] <Tobbi> Hume2: I don't remember.
[2016/02/02 16:14:42] <Tobbi> I was just doing this for the fun value of it.
[2016/02/02 16:14:54] <Hume2> I see.
[2016/02/02 16:15:40] <brmbrmcar> Is it any good?
[2016/02/02 16:15:46] <brmbrmcar> s/Is/Was/
[2016/02/02 16:15:46] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "Was it any good?"
[2016/02/02 16:15:58] <Hume2> It's good for school computers :D
[2016/02/02 16:16:08] <Tobbi> Hume2: you got it! :D
[2016/02/02 16:18:53] <brmbrmcar> I don't get it.
[2016/02/02 16:19:15] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What don't you get?
[2016/02/02 16:20:47] <brmbrmcar> A horse making noise with the picture.
[2016/02/02 16:21:06] <brmbrmcar> Is the horse eating the food.
[2016/02/02 16:21:08] <brmbrmcar> ?
[2016/02/02 16:21:25] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: *sigh* I should really update the source.
[2016/02/02 16:23:59] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2016/02/02 16:24:29] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: No, I think. I think that the horse doesn't display anyway.
[2016/02/02 16:24:57] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar, Hume2: It's only the lasagna that shows. And while showing it, you can hear a horse sound.
[2016/02/02 16:25:24] <Hume2> I thought so.
[2016/02/02 16:26:27] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 16:26:40] <brmbrmcar> I thoughr so too.
[2016/02/02 16:28:27] <sydney_untangle> Cool! https://openrct2.org/
[2016/02/02 16:28:51] <Tobbi> I never played that.
[2016/02/02 16:30:22] <Hume2> Ever notet that the word "sign" is similar to "sigh"?
[2016/02/02 16:31:19] <Tobbi> Hume2: No, I didn't.
[2016/02/02 16:33:51] <Hume2> I'll go to bed, bye!

[2016/02/03 07:15:38] <MCMic> Hello, can you tell me what is the windows equivalent for folder «~/.supertux/» ?
[2016/02/03 07:15:54] <MCMic> I meant «~/.supertux2/»
[2016/02/03 07:16:00] <Hume2> It should be %appdata%/.supertux2
[2016/02/03 07:16:24] <MCMic> hum, and %appdata% is something people can find easily?
[2016/02/03 07:16:54] <Hume2> I guess you can just type it to the Windows explorer and it opens.
[2016/02/03 07:17:02] <MCMic> ok
[2016/02/03 07:17:30] <MCMic> Thanks
[2016/02/03 07:18:02] <MCMic> I’m speedrunning supertux and needed to explain people how to get a fresh profile: http://www.speedrun.com/SuperTux/guide/n1uyf

[2016/02/03 10:53:04] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: And i don't really want to learn how to code...
[2016/02/03 10:53:38] <sydney_untangle> I didn't realize that Android programs are Java. o_O
[2016/02/03 10:53:42] <Tobbi> k
[2016/02/03 10:59:35] <brmbrmcar> Java is evil.
[2016/02/03 11:00:54] <sydney_untangle> brmbrmcar: Oracle Java is evil.
[2016/02/03 11:03:13] <mt> you can also use non-Java code on android
[2016/02/03 11:03:14] <mt> https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html
[2016/02/03 11:07:29] <Tobbi> mt: I tell you: Just: Don't! NDK reminds me of my project. I don't want to be remembered.
[2016/02/03 11:08:06] <Tobbi> Also, sydney_untangle: What's wrong with Java?
[2016/02/03 11:09:05] <mt> Java is just full of security problems
[2016/02/03 11:09:55] <brmbrmcar> sydney_untangle: What's the difference?
[2016/02/03 11:11:13] <sydney_untangle> Well, security holes, and the installer provided by oracle likes to install junkware IE bars on grandparents computers...
[2016/02/03 11:12:11] <brmbrmcar> grandparents computers = bad security
[2016/02/03 11:12:26] <brmbrmcar> Oracle knoes that well.
[2016/02/03 11:14:35] <brmbrmcar> Do they give back data to gain that?

[2016/02/03 12:04:12] <Hume2> It's yeallow.
[2016/02/03 12:04:24] <brmbrmcar> Good.

[2016/02/03 12:05:03] <Hume2> OK
[2016/02/03 12:05:24] <mt> brmbrmcar: please don't

[2016/02/03 12:05:47] <mt> abuse colors
[2016/02/03 12:05:56] <brmbrmcar> I won't.
[2016/02/03 12:06:02] <brmbrmcar> I tested it.
[2016/02/03 12:06:03] <mt> you did
[2016/02/03 12:06:27] <brmbrmcar> I know!
[2016/02/03 12:06:35] <mt> that wasn't testing, since -c is actually -c; if that wouldn't work it would've been discovered before
[2016/02/03 12:06:48] <mt> you did abuse it, that's what I was referring to
[2016/02/03 12:06:48] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2016/02/03 12:07:08] <mt> consider that as a warning
[2016/02/03 12:07:15] <brmbrmcar> I checked it for reasons of wierdness.

[2016/02/03 12:23:20] <sistemx> Hello, I want ask, if I can use sound and sprites and characters ets to my game. I am beginer and I don't undestand licence fully. Do sombody know?
[2016/02/03 12:29:43] <mt> the best thing you can do is consulting a lawyer
[2016/02/03 12:30:58] <Hume2> Yes, but don't ask two lawyers, because you wouldn't get the same thing :D
[2016/02/03 12:32:34] <Hume2> In short, you can use it even without asking, but uder some kind of termas. I don't remember it much.
[2016/02/03 12:33:21] <mt> most would fall under https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-%28gpl-3%29 or https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/
[2016/02/03 12:33:38] <Hume2> I don't know about the other, but I wouldn't blame you even if you used it incorrectly.
[2016/02/03 12:33:59] <mt> note that these simplifications are just for easier understanding
[2016/02/03 12:34:28] <mt> for the full legal implications, consult with a lawyer and ask them about the actual license content
[2016/02/03 12:35:50] <sistemx> I am talking about supertux
[2016/02/03 12:36:00] <mt> yes
[2016/02/03 12:36:21] <mt> most of supertux would fall under the licenses mentioned
[2016/02/03 12:36:25] <sistemx> I see, so it is not easy as I  thought :(
[2016/02/03 12:36:58] <Hume2> If you want to make some profit, then it's not easy.
[2016/02/03 12:37:19] <sistemx> I   thought, if some thing is "open source" you can use it as I can. But looks too difficult
[2016/02/03 12:37:48] <Hume2> Not really, there's some kind of law jungle arround it.
[2016/02/03 12:37:51] <sistemx> profit is not priority for me now, I am beginer and I want help to Ubuntu touch
[2016/02/03 12:38:05] <mt> it's still copyrighted and you've still got some restrictions
[2016/02/03 12:38:06] <sistemx> So I want make some games
[2016/02/03 12:38:15] <Hume2> Then you just mention the authors of the resources.
[2016/02/03 12:38:25] <Hume2> This should be enough, I hope.
[2016/02/03 12:39:10] <mt> I think even GPL and CC-BY-SA allow commercial redistribution in at least some cases, but DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A LAWYER
[2016/02/03 12:39:32] <Hume2> I am not a lawyer too.
[2016/02/03 12:39:40] <sistemx> So you mean that I will check contact from supertux web site and ask them? Or check names and ask directly to each person?
[2016/02/03 12:40:09] <Hume2> You don't have to ask, I hope.
[2016/02/03 12:40:22] <mt> you don't usually even need to ask, just put their name somewhere in your game (e.g. in the credits)
[2016/02/03 12:40:35] <mt> for most open source licenses
[2016/02/03 12:40:50] <sistemx> Something like this I read before
[2016/02/03 12:41:07] <mt> also, be sure to check the files included in the repos if a file you're going to use is not under the usual license
[2016/02/03 12:41:28] <sistemx> But I just worry, play with license is not fun :(
[2016/02/03 12:41:42] <mt> e.g. there's a soundtrack included in the game that we're only allowed to use due to permission from the original author
[2016/02/03 12:42:05] <sistemx> I see
[2016/02/03 12:42:21] <Hume2> Yes, the GPL says that it should be distributed under the same license.
[2016/02/03 12:42:31] <sistemx> So maybe better way find open source game from one owner
[2016/02/03 12:42:55] <sistemx> it is too complicate :)
[2016/02/03 12:42:56] <mt> most open source projects have multiple authors
[2016/02/03 12:42:58] <sistemx> :(
[2016/02/03 12:43:01] <mt> that's the entire point of it
[2016/02/03 12:43:20] <mt> also http://opengameart.org/ for more art (but check the license too)
[2016/02/03 12:43:37] <mt> oh and what's important to mention:
[2016/02/03 12:43:48] <Hume2> I think that this my mad response speaks for everything: https://github.com/SuperTux/addons/issues/9
[2016/02/03 12:44:04] <mt> we might be exaggerating about this
[2016/02/03 12:44:19] <mt> but we don't want to be liable for stuff you do
[2016/02/03 12:44:20] <sistemx> This site I know, But best is find all together. on this website I can not find all together..
[2016/02/03 12:45:37] <sistemx> Anyway, thanks for help..
[2016/02/03 12:45:45] <mt> Hume2: (that's still open)
[2016/02/03 12:45:54] <Hume2> damn
[2016/02/03 12:46:12] <Hume2> Anyway, do you know why I put there that response?
[2016/02/03 12:46:41] <mt> Hume2: (also in the level files you seem to have specified GPL 2+/CC-BY-SA 3.0 even if you don't care, so something public domain-ish would be appropriate)

[2016/02/03 12:47:05] <mt> if we don't specify in the source place
[2016/02/03 12:47:17] <mt> we'll have a problem when we want to move away from github oslt

[2016/02/03 12:47:57] <Hume2> I responsed like this because I wanted to know whether he really needs to know the license.
[2016/02/03 12:49:02] <Hume2> I knew that this was created just because he wanted to complain.

[2016/02/03 14:04:29] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/03 14:04:39] <Tobbi> Unless you look (or it makes this "ding" sound) the baby might or might not be alive.
[2016/02/03 14:06:09] <Hume2> If the baby was smaller than the wavelength, it would stay alive.

[2016/02/03 14:20:39] <Hume2> They cost only 59 CZK.
[2016/02/03 14:21:46] <Hume2> The price is excluding those wooden parts: http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/necyklopedie/images/6/61/Mezery_v_plotu.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091220130747
[2016/02/03 14:29:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: Surely the baby can observe itself? :D
[2016/02/03 14:29:41] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, the cat can observe itself as well.
[2016/02/03 14:30:07] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/03 14:30:12] <Hume2> Yes, but the wave fuction would collapse for us after we open the microwave.
[2016/02/03 14:30:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hmmm. I don't understand schrodinger's cat...
[2016/02/03 14:30:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's just about the person being outside not being able to observer.
[2016/02/03 14:30:30] <Tobbi> *observe
[2016/02/03 14:30:42] <Tobbi> Also, I forgot quite a lot about this anyway...
[2016/02/03 14:31:50] <Hume2> It's also hard to get it, I think.
[2016/02/03 14:32:25] <Hume2> And it's not much useful if you aren't going to construct quantum computers.
[2016/02/03 14:32:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: But surely whether the person can observe or not doesn't matter :D
[2016/02/03 14:33:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: But, you need an actual observer to make a finite decision about whether the baby is alive or not.
[2016/02/03 14:33:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: What about God :P :D
[2016/02/03 14:33:38] <Karkus> ?
[2016/02/03 14:34:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Way too philosophical for me.
[2016/02/03 14:34:10] <Hume2> Don't you think Chuck Norris?
[2016/02/03 14:34:13] <Hume2> :P
[2016/02/03 14:34:19] <Tobbi> Oh god... :D Well, he'd know...same for someone who'd observe the baby's cries vanish...
[2016/02/03 14:34:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's actually a physics analogy.
[2016/02/03 14:34:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is it something to do with Quantum Superpositions?
[2016/02/03 14:35:02] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes...exactly.
[2016/02/03 14:35:23] <Karkus> Tobbi: It certainly helps me to not understand them at all...
[2016/02/03 14:35:27] <Hume2> Some people are at superposition of two opinions.
[2016/02/03 14:35:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: I was bad at everything in high school.
[2016/02/03 14:35:57] <Tobbi> everything...no exceptions.
[2016/02/03 14:36:58] <Hume2> It doesn't matter. They teach just crap anyway.
[2016/02/03 14:37:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Nothing at all? Well, I guess with programming you found your place?
[2016/02/03 14:37:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, okay I was good at Philosophy and computer science.
[2016/02/03 14:37:37] <Tobbi> And I might've even been good at other subjects if I had been interested in them.
[2016/02/03 14:37:39] <Tobbi> But I wasn't.
[2016/02/03 14:37:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: You should've tried being interested at maths :D
[2016/02/03 14:38:27] <Tobbi> And no, with programming, I didn't find my place. This is just a temporary thing, I imagine.
[2016/02/03 14:38:34] <Tobbi> I want this to be just a temporary thing.
[2016/02/03 14:38:45] <Tobbi> The outlook of having to program my entire life makes me sad.
[2016/02/03 14:38:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: Fair enough.
[2016/02/03 14:39:01] <Tobbi> :)
[2016/02/03 14:39:35] <Hume2> I don't want to program my life as well. This scares me.
[2016/02/03 14:39:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: About flexlay
[2016/02/03 14:39:41] <Karkus> ~excuse
[2016/02/03 14:39:41] <red_bot> Karkus: It's not plugged in.
[2016/02/03 14:39:48] <Tobbi> Flexlay is not plugged in?
[2016/02/03 14:40:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, I'm trying to get a suitable excuse for not committing for a while...
[2016/02/03 14:40:21] <Tobbi> Karkus: oh, don't worry. Neither have I...
[2016/02/03 14:40:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I've been more busy than usual lately...
[2016/02/03 14:40:36] <Karkus> I will get round to it, soon as I can.
[2016/02/03 14:40:39] <Karkus> ~excuse
[2016/02/03 14:40:39] <red_bot> Karkus: routing problems on the neural net
[2016/02/03 14:40:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: Again, don't worry about it... I have been busy with stuff as well... college...
[2016/02/03 14:41:34] <Karkus> Tobbi, Hume2: Anyways, gtg afk now, bye :D
[2016/02/03 14:41:42] <Tobbi> See you.
[2016/02/03 14:41:49] <Hume2> Bye!
[2016/02/03 14:42:46] <Hume2> Narre has a special subject for numeric technologies.
[2016/02/03 14:43:31] <Hume2> He says that all students except him and one more, fail it properly.
[2016/02/03 14:44:20] <Hume2> And the tests are only transfering numbers from hexadecimary to binary, to decimal etc.
[2016/02/03 14:44:25] <Tobbi> The stuff we do in college is boooring...
[2016/02/03 14:44:39] <Tobbi> And by boring I mean: I cannot just think fastly...
[2016/02/03 14:44:50] <Tobbi> *fast
[2016/02/03 14:44:57] <Hume2> That makes sense.
[2016/02/03 14:45:07] <Tobbi> Hume2: Really or are you kidding me?
[2016/02/03 14:45:17] <Hume2> The most of the request use to be think something fast.
[2016/02/03 14:45:22] <Hume2> I know that.
[2016/02/03 14:45:36] <Tobbi> I really have a problem with long tasks where you don't get somewhere...
[2016/02/03 14:45:44] <Hume2> I too.
[2016/02/03 14:45:59] <Hume2> It gets boring.
[2016/02/03 14:46:12] <Tobbi> Hume2: But maybe that's not a special thing...
[2016/02/03 14:46:33] <Tobbi> Not sure if faster pace is really what I want...
[2016/02/03 14:47:03] <Hume2> I think speed is not as useful as the results.
[2016/02/03 14:47:27] <Tobbi> I know...
[2016/02/03 14:49:06] <Hume2> I liked maths, but it started to bore me, because it starts to be the same all the time.
[2016/02/03 14:49:37] <Hume2> Well, there is a difference between maths and school maths.
[2016/02/03 14:51:05] <Hume2> The teachers accidentally sometimes learn also something from the maths, but that's not important for getting a good mark from test.
[2016/02/03 14:52:48] <Tobbi> Hume2: School is crap. :P
[2016/02/03 14:52:54] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/03 14:53:01] <Tobbi> Who needs school, if I want I could rule the world. :D
[2016/02/03 14:53:19] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/03 14:55:16] <Hume2> Do you know, how hard is it now?
[2016/02/03 14:55:42] <Hume2> First you must wait for a bad economic situation and think a way how to solve it.
[2016/02/03 14:55:49] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/03 14:57:03] <Tobbi> ohrm.
[2016/02/03 14:57:05] <Tobbi> hrm
[2016/02/03 14:58:06] <Hume2> And then you just anschluss the states arround and hope that you win :DDDDD
[2016/02/03 15:00:28] <Tobbi> anschluss?
[2016/02/03 15:00:31] <Tobbi> connection?
[2016/02/03 15:00:50] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/03 15:02:02] <Hume2> In Czech we have a special word for connecting Austria to Germany, "anšlusovat".

[2016/02/03 18:27:56] <sydney_untangle> have you*
[2016/02/03 18:28:32] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Not much. I watched videos of "The Hoax Hotel" (scamming scammers). And I just watched a short clip from Pulp Fiction.
[2016/02/03 18:29:25] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Hrm.
[2016/02/03 18:29:34] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Do you know Pulp Fiction?
[2016/02/03 18:29:44] <Tobbi> actually, how old are you?
[2016/02/03 18:30:27] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: 16.
[2016/02/03 18:30:30] <sydney_untangle> No i don't.
[2016/02/03 18:30:56] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Okay, you would be allowed to watch it...
[2016/02/03 18:30:58] <Tobbi> but, nah.
[2016/02/03 18:31:15] <Tobbi> But you can read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction
[2016/02/03 18:32:13] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Eh, i think i will skip.
[2016/02/03 18:32:19] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/02/03 18:35:18] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Watch some pink panther instead...
[2016/02/03 18:35:28] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Not at the moment...
[2016/02/03 18:35:46] <sydney_untangle> Heh. :)
[2016/02/03 18:46:23] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: You just reminded me: I let Microsoft Sam read out this PDF some time ago: http://www.catholiclabor.org/gen-art/cafod-computers.pdf
[2016/02/03 18:46:42] <Tobbi> I still remember it saying "Clean up your computer - Working conditions in the electronic sector"

[2016/02/04 10:09:38] <Tobbi> Okay, what I did was not good.
[2016/02/04 10:09:48] <Tobbi> Force-pushing tinygettext because I tried to integrate upstream changes.
[2016/02/04 10:09:49] <Tobbi> gargh
[2016/02/04 10:10:20] <Tobbi> Should've done a branch instead.

[2016/02/04 11:12:06] <mt> ewww
[2016/02/04 11:12:18] <mt> could you *please* test things in a *test* branch
[2016/02/04 11:13:12] <Tobbi> mt: I have an upstream branch now, which is the test branch.
[2016/02/04 11:13:32] <Tobbi> mt: And, yes, I did manage to restore things to normal and enable branch protection...
[2016/02/04 11:13:41] <Tobbi> for that tinygettext master branch.
[2016/02/04 11:13:58] <mt> I'm talking about the supertux master branch
[2016/02/04 11:14:08] <mt> You shouldn't abuse it as a sandbox to play with
[2016/02/04 11:14:19] <Tobbi> mt: I did test things locally, not knowing that it doesn't fetch the tinygettext source from a different directory.
[2016/02/04 11:14:25] <mt> Because in master, history shouldn't be rewritten
[2016/02/04 11:14:41] <Tobbi> mt: So, I thought it fetches the source from external/tinygettext, but it doesn't...
[2016/02/04 11:14:51] <Tobbi> It creates a different directory, and reuses the source.
[2016/02/04 11:15:03] <Tobbi> And, yes, I am sorry about this.

[2016/02/04 12:01:29] <Tobbi> Okay, I am out of ideas for that appveyor build.
[2016/02/04 12:01:37] <Tobbi> But at least we're now at the latest upstream.
[2016/02/04 12:03:29] <Tobbi> mt, sydney_untangle, Karkus: What do you guys think about having symbols for levelset / worldmap in the game instead of writing it in the add-ons manager?
[2016/02/04 12:03:42] <Tobbi> That way, the list takes up way less space than before.
[2016/02/04 12:03:59] <Tobbi> If we have an icon there...
[2016/02/04 12:04:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: Symbols?
[2016/02/04 12:04:12] <mt> if we have TTF
[2016/02/04 12:04:20] <mt> we could easily add that as character
[2016/02/04 12:04:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: For example: You have one symbol for levelset, I don't know, make something up, and one symbol for worldmap.
[2016/02/04 12:04:45] <Tobbi> Yup, but adding an icon shouldn't be too difficult.
[2016/02/04 12:05:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: That way you know which is which? Sounds good
[2016/02/04 12:06:28] <Tobbi> Karkus: Exactly.

[2016/02/04 14:10:14] <Karkus> Hume2: I guess worldmap could be a small island, and levelset a list?
[2016/02/04 14:10:22] <Karkus> icon of a list
[2016/02/04 14:10:33] <Hume2> Icon of a list, hmmm...
[2016/02/04 14:11:18] <Hume2> A moment...
[2016/02/04 14:12:19] <Hume2> Karkus: Currently we have only worlds.
[2016/02/04 14:12:31] <Karkus> Hume2: test levels?
[2016/02/04 14:13:06] <Hume2> So are we speking about addon manager or about  contrib level menu?
[2016/02/04 14:14:32] <Karkus> Idk it was Tobbi's idea. I guess probably addon manager in which case you are correct
[2016/02/04 14:15:16] <Hume2> Karkus: So currently we have only worldmap addons.
[2016/02/04 14:15:37] <Karkus> Hume2: Then maybe this isn't needed?
[2016/02/04 14:15:47] <Hume2> And I think we should also start considering the quality of the new addons.
[2016/02/04 14:16:09] <Hume2> That way we won't have any levelsets among addons.
[2016/02/04 14:16:35] <Karkus> Hume2: Do you think it would be possible to add the ability to specify a level directory, and the levels appear? e.g. supertux2 ~
[2016/02/04 14:17:09] <Hume2> I'm not sure what are you talking about.
[2016/02/04 14:17:24] <Hume2> Don't you mean supertux2/levels ?
[2016/02/04 14:18:37] <Hume2> Karkus: also: The good levels from levelsets could be included in bonus islands.
[2016/02/04 14:19:39] <Karkus> Hume2: It's an idea. You specify a directory, instead of a single level, and the .stl & .stwm files are displayed so you can play them
[2016/02/04 14:19:57] <Karkus> Hume2: I think we have way too many levels in the bonus islands tbh
[2016/02/04 14:20:09] <Hume2> Karkus: got what you mean.
[2016/02/04 14:21:11] <Hume2> Anything < 30 levels is just a little thingy :D

[2016/02/05 09:23:09] <Tobbi> Hello maths22 (?)
[2016/02/05 09:24:25] <mt> it's an unstable connection
[2016/02/05 09:25:14] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2016/02/05 09:25:31] <mt> I actually have this useful feature in my script
[2016/02/05 09:25:52] <mt> if I ban-forward someone to ##fix-your-connection
[2016/02/05 09:26:09] <mt> it will/should automatically unban that after some (12?) hours
[2016/02/05 09:26:56] <mt> s/##fix-your-connection/##fix_your_connection/
[2016/02/05 09:26:56] <red_bot> mt: You did something wrong... Try s/you/me/ or tell me "help sed"
[2016/02/05 09:27:02] @ Quit: maths22: Ping timeout: 276 seconds
[2016/02/05 09:29:16] <Tobbi> Didn't know that existed.
[2016/02/05 09:29:35] <Tobbi> mt: How do you ban-forward guys anyway?
[2016/02/05 09:29:48] <mt> magic
[2016/02/05 09:30:08] <Tobbi> mt: You're not capable of using humor, so stop trying.
[2016/02/05 09:30:51] <mt> /mode #channel1 +b $a:Tobbi$#channel2
[2016/02/05 09:31:15] <mt> or globally, matching all bans, invites, etc...: /mode #channel1 +f #channel2
[2016/02/05 09:31:26] <Tobbi> Ah, nice
[2016/02/05 09:31:29] <Tobbi> I will note that.
[2016/02/05 09:31:38] <mt> per-ban forwards have a higher priority than +f
[2016/02/05 09:32:37] <mt> obligatory-alias-usage: please have a look at https://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml to see what modes do on freenode

[2016/02/05 10:12:57] <sydney_untangle> It's just suprising how serious she is taking it...
[2016/02/05 10:17:43] <mt> sydney_untangle: why are you highlighting me?

[2016/02/06 03:06:35] <mcmic> Hello
[2016/02/06 03:07:00] <mcmic> The wiki is still saying «newest version:SuperTux 0.3.5 (Changelog) »
[2016/02/06 03:14:59] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki is the wiki you want
[2016/02/06 03:16:35] <mt> the old wiki's history has been imported to https://github.com/SuperTux/wiki/tree/mediawiki and will hopefully be converted to be Gollum-compatible and merged with the current Gollum wiki
[2016/02/06 03:23:17] <mcmic> hum ok
[2016/02/06 03:23:31] <mcmic> It should be more clear on the old wiki that it’s obsolete
[2016/02/06 03:24:55] <mt> open an issue on github
[2016/02/06 03:25:16] <mt> that will annoy all the responsible people via email
[2016/02/06 03:38:09] <mcmic> ^^

[2016/02/07 08:35:24] <Hume2> mt: I think we should consider two discussion-needed issues.
[2016/02/07 08:35:47] <Hume2> #258 and #319.
[2016/02/07 08:36:36] <mt> what's to be discussed at https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/319?
[2016/02/07 08:37:17] <Hume2> I guess just whether it's an issue or not.
[2016/02/07 08:37:27] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/258 - sho8uld be oriented more at the colors of the current hats
[2016/02/07 08:37:51] <Hume2> How do you think that?
[2016/02/07 08:38:15] <mt> well, just use approximately the same color as in the actual hat
[2016/02/07 08:38:39] <Hume2> Yes, that would make sense.
[2016/02/07 08:38:58] <Hume2> So it's a needs-work then.
[2016/02/07 08:39:28] <mt> oh and I'd like .xfc, .psd, .kra or some other kind of source file
[2016/02/07 08:39:49] <mt> want to comment or should I do that?
[2016/02/07 08:39:57] <Hume2> OK, I'll response on it.
[2016/02/07 08:40:47] <mt> btw
[2016/02/07 08:40:56] <mt> did we ever consider GSoC?
[2016/02/07 08:41:02] <pentagon> [10supertux] 07Hume2 commented on issue 09#258: Ice, air and earth Christmas hats 13https://git.io/vRAYt
[2016/02/07 08:41:11] <Hume2> What is GSoc?
[2016/02/07 08:41:25] <mt> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code
[2016/02/07 08:41:47] * Hume2 is reading that
[2016/02/07 08:42:17] <mt> The STK folks participated in that, and I think there were quite a few contributors
[2016/02/07 08:44:41] <Hume2> Well, contest are always won by someone else. :D
[2016/02/07 08:44:53] <mt> what?
[2016/02/07 08:45:03] <Hume2> Win that kind of contest is quite hard, you know.
[2016/02/07 08:45:37] <Hume2> If we want to win that, we should get who sponsors it first.
[2016/02/07 08:45:37] <mt> you mean getting the project accepted?
[2016/02/07 08:45:51] <Hume2> Yes, I guess.
[2016/02/07 08:46:10] <Hume2> Or get a good position.
[2016/02/07 08:46:15] <mt> Well, it's not really about winning I think
[2016/02/07 08:46:31] <Hume2> hmmm…
[2016/02/07 08:46:31] <mt> It's more, you get your project accepted
[2016/02/07 08:46:40] <mt> Look for students you can mentor
[2016/02/07 08:46:58] <Hume2> I didn't read it whole.
[2016/02/07 08:47:02] <mt> They'll write you an application and you decide who you'd consider mentoring
[2016/02/07 08:47:14] <mt> Google then says 'you get to mentor x people'
[2016/02/07 08:47:21] <mt> And they'll code for you
[2016/02/07 08:47:29] <mt> or whatever
[2016/02/07 08:47:38] <Hume2> Well…
[2016/02/07 08:48:26] <mt> ping leyyin - do you want to tell us more about GSoC?
[2016/02/07 08:52:23] <mt> Hume2: hmm
[2016/02/07 08:52:31] <mt> it would be something to consider fast
[2016/02/07 08:52:38] <Hume2> mt: I didn't get it.
[2016/02/07 08:52:44] <mt> since the mentor organization application window starts tomorrow
[2016/02/07 08:52:52] <mt> it's open until February 19th
[2016/02/07 08:53:01] <Hume2> So do we have to be on the top positions to get some mentors?
[2016/02/07 08:53:04] <mt> https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/
[2016/02/07 08:53:15] <mt> nah, the mentors would be us
[2016/02/07 08:53:30] <Hume2> ah
[2016/02/07 08:53:46] <mt> https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/
[2016/02/07 08:54:05] <Hume2> LOL, translation error:      Domovská stránka Resources History Rules
[2016/02/07 08:55:31] <mt> pentagon: later tell Tobbi hi, we should consider participating as GSoC mentor organization - https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/ (we'd have to decide fast, organizations can apply from 2016-02-08 to 2016-02-19)
[2016/02/07 08:55:31] <pentagon> mt: The operation succeeded.
[2016/02/07 08:57:16] <Hume2> I'm getting lost.
[2016/02/07 08:57:21] <mt> why?
[2016/02/07 08:57:58] <Hume2> I can't get it. So we will tech some studetnst to program SuperTux and they will program it? Or what?
[2016/02/07 08:58:39] <mt> we will mentor computer science students - explain the SuperTux's codebase, and yes they can code some features
[2016/02/07 08:58:52] <mt> and Google pays them
[2016/02/07 08:59:18] <mt> https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq
[2016/02/07 09:01:52] <Hume2> I start getting it…
[2016/02/07 09:05:35] <leyyin> mt, what do you want to know?
[2016/02/07 09:05:42] <mt> everything
[2016/02/07 09:05:45] <leyyin> pff
[2016/02/07 09:05:49] <leyyin> kinda vague
[2016/02/07 09:06:22] <leyyin> the website or wikipedia explains it better imho
[2016/02/07 09:06:31] <leyyin> if you have specific questions
[2016/02/07 09:07:06] <mt> did STK have any specific goals before the mentor organization application?
[2016/02/07 09:07:12] <leyyin> yes
[2016/02/07 09:07:25] <mt> do you need them at that time?
[2016/02/07 09:07:31] <leyyin> they have some ideas
[2016/02/07 09:07:32] <Hume2> Imagine Tobbi as a mentor :D

[2016/02/07 09:08:44] <leyyin> when students apply it would be nice to have the ideas there
[2016/02/07 09:09:00] <leyyin> some general ideas of projects they can do
[2016/02/07 09:09:07] <mt> what would mentors do exactly? Answer the student's questions?
[2016/02/07 09:09:28] <leyyin> mentor him, show him when he is stuck
[2016/02/07 09:09:34] <leyyin> answer questions, etc
[2016/02/07 09:09:48] <Hume2> And say words beginning on * and ending on * :D
[2016/02/07 09:10:12] @ irungentoo joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/07 09:10:18] <Hume2> Yeah, I should stop.
[2016/02/07 09:10:36] <leyyin> Tobbi, you are a mentor, congrats
[2016/02/07 09:10:44] <Tobbi> leyyin: WHAT?
[2016/02/07 09:10:45] <pentagon> Tobbi: Sent 15 minutes ago: <mt> hi, we should consider participating as GSoC mentor organization - https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/ (we'd have to decide fast, organizations can apply from 2016-02-08 to 2016-02-19)
[2016/02/07 09:10:51] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2016/02/07 09:11:05] <Tobbi> Something tells me there's gonna be a lot of scrollback.
[2016/02/07 09:11:12] <Tobbi> leyyin: Problem is: As a mentor, I cannot get money, can I?
[2016/02/07 09:11:41] <Tobbi> Hume2: Oh, yes, and saying *sigh* is one of the key features of being a mentor
[2016/02/07 09:11:49] <Tobbi> Finally I can say that without fear of retribution.
[2016/02/07 09:11:55] <leyyin> you get 500$
[2016/02/07 09:12:02] <Tobbi> leyyin: As a mentor, I do?
[2016/02/07 09:12:05] <leyyin> yes
[2016/02/07 09:12:12] <Tobbi> mt: Apply immediately!
[2016/02/07 09:12:13] <leyyin> or hmm, the organization
[2016/02/07 09:12:16] <leyyin> which is you :D
[2016/02/07 09:12:22] <Tobbi> leyyin: My point exactly.
[2016/02/07 09:12:25] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/02/07 09:12:29] <Hume2> And do I have to provide my personal info to get the money?
[2016/02/07 09:12:33] <mt> Tobbi: we can't until tomorrow
[2016/02/07 09:12:36] <Tobbi> Hume2: You?
[2016/02/07 09:12:44] <Tobbi> Why would you be getting any money? :D
[2016/02/07 09:12:52] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/07 09:13:16] <mt> 500 USD/$number_of_mentors
[2016/02/07 09:13:40] <Hume2> What about this, Tobbi: You'll be the official mentor and I'll be mentoring :D
[2016/02/07 09:13:51] <Tobbi> Hume2: Meaning, I'll get the money? :D
[2016/02/07 09:13:56] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/07 09:13:56] <Tobbi> damn this.
[2016/02/07 09:14:03] <Tobbi> actually, that's not fair.
[2016/02/07 09:14:09] <Tobbi> Hume2: We can split evenly, if you want
[2016/02/07 09:15:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: I know I often joke about getting money to pay for various things in my life, but honestly, I would probably not feel happy with keeping the money...
[2016/02/07 09:15:32] <Hume2> I thought so.
[2016/02/07 09:15:36] <mt> "* Mentors should expect to spend at least 10 hours a week for each student."
[2016/02/07 09:15:52] <mt> (http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsoc-mentoring/about-this-manual/)
[2016/02/07 09:16:07] <Tobbi> That sounds good. I can do that...
[2016/02/07 09:16:12] <Tobbi> I spend 10 hours a week anyway.
[2016/02/07 09:16:24] <Tobbi> Actually, be back in a bit getting something to eat.
[2016/02/07 09:17:02] <pentagon> [10supertux] 07brmbrmcar commented on issue 09#258: Ice, air and earth Christmas hats 13https://git.io/vRAYt
[2016/02/07 09:17:04] <mt> Yeah, we're probably even having more than 10 hours a week discussing silly topics in here
[2016/02/07 09:17:13] <mt> Would be nice to fill that with something useful
[2016/02/07 09:17:22] <leyyin> like politics
[2016/02/07 09:17:23] * leyyin runs
[2016/02/07 09:17:46] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/07 09:18:23] <Tobbi> leyyin: Who do you want to win the presidential elections? :P
[2016/02/07 09:19:16] <mt> that's off-topic and since there's an on-topic discussion right now this discussion shouldn't take place in here :D
[2016/02/07 09:19:35] <leyyin> mt, kick me then :P
[2016/02/07 09:19:42] <mt> so, I could probably be a "backup mentor"
[2016/02/07 09:19:49] <Hume2> OK, do they need any personal info?
[2016/02/07 09:19:52] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/07 09:20:09] <leyyin> Hume2, your blood type
[2016/02/07 09:20:10] <mt> Hume2: google already has that anyway :D
[2016/02/07 09:20:24] <Hume2> mt: No, they don't :P
[2016/02/07 09:20:33] <leyyin> Tobbi, Donald Trump, so that I can watch the world burn
[2016/02/07 09:20:36] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/07 09:20:38] <Tobbi> leyyin: Great.

[2016/02/07 09:21:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: Also, blood type is actually pretty important in case you keep hitting your head against your desk and get a head wound and lose blood...
[2016/02/07 09:21:18] <leyyin> or you are a vampire and need food
[2016/02/07 09:21:35] <mt> Hume2: why not "Hume the Second"
[2016/02/07 09:21:49] <Hume2> mt: Because TeraTux was first.
[2016/02/07 09:21:56] <Tobbi> I'm Hume, the second I am, HUme the second, I am I am, I got married to the widow next door.
[2016/02/07 09:22:01] <Tobbi> She's been married 7 times before.
[2016/02/07 09:22:05] <Hume2> Yes and I'm 116 years old on Google :D
[2016/02/07 09:22:28] <leyyin> Hume2, believe me, google know everything about you
[2016/02/07 09:22:43] <Hume2> Hmmm…
[2016/02/07 09:23:08] <Hume2> Maybe the IP-detect? crap
[2016/02/07 09:23:17] <mt> oh right, some STK GSoC students work(ed) at Google, so you know that
[2016/02/07 09:23:30] <Tobbi> leyyin: Can you believe that I wanted to get a Doner yesterday at 11:40pm and they didn't have any?
[2016/02/07 09:23:43] <Tobbi> I was so furious...
[2016/02/07 09:23:47] <Tobbi> Well, actually, not really.
[2016/02/07 09:24:00] <leyyin> eating fast food at night
[2016/02/07 09:24:05] <leyyin> were you drunk?
[2016/02/07 09:24:13] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, just hungry.
[2016/02/07 09:24:18] <Tobbi> Also, döner is healthy fast food
[2016/02/07 09:24:25] <leyyin> " healthy fast food"
[2016/02/07 09:24:41] <Tobbi> leyyin: There's actual vegetables in there...
[2016/02/07 09:25:03] <Tobbi> So, the more vegetables, the healthier...
[2016/02/07 09:25:04] <leyyin> the salad at MC has 500 Kcal

[2016/02/07 09:25:39] <mt> guys
[2016/02/07 09:25:52] <mt> can we stop talking about $useless-thing
[2016/02/07 09:25:52] <Tobbi> mt: We concluded the GsoC talks, saying that we want to participate...
[2016/02/07 09:26:01] @ Mode -o mt by mt
[2016/02/07 09:26:03] <mt> okay
[2016/02/07 09:26:21] <mt> so, we'll look into what's required for applying tomorrow?
[2016/02/07 09:26:24] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2016/02/07 09:26:34] <Hume2> The students choose between the projects freely, right?
[2016/02/07 09:26:36] <Tobbi> If they need a bank account, I will apply myself...
[2016/02/07 09:26:37] * sydney_untangle yawns...
[2016/02/07 09:26:45] <mt> we should also look at some issues we'd like to get done
[2016/02/07 09:26:45] <Tobbi> Good afternoon sydney_untangle
[2016/02/07 09:27:16] <Tobbi> mt: By the way: I don't think that dashes are allowed in variables, so $useless-thing is likely a useless thing.
[2016/02/07 09:27:41] <leyyin> Tobbi, did you try perl?
[2016/02/07 09:27:45] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: hola.
[2016/02/07 09:27:54] <leyyin> I am pretty sure perl is a monster and allows everything :D
[2016/02/07 09:27:56] <Tobbi> leyyin: I did try it once, and had a hangover for several years.
[2016/02/07 09:28:40] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: JS is a monster and allows everything as well, anyways, in websites...
[2016/02/07 09:28:49] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: JS is beautiful, perl isn't.
[2016/02/07 09:29:06] <mt> node.js <3
[2016/02/07 09:29:14] <Tobbi> Perl is the ugliest thing, right after <insert non-appropriate yo mamma joke here>
[2016/02/07 09:29:43] <Tobbi> I'll probably get a Döner now...or something else from the bakery...
[2016/02/07 09:29:54] <Tobbi> So, you can continue talking about on-topic things.
[2016/02/07 09:29:55] <mt> but heh, JS actually allows Unicode for variables
[2016/02/07 09:30:07] <Tobbi> var döner = {}
[2016/02/07 09:30:09] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/07 09:30:19] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/07 09:30:32] <mt> var döner = new Food('döner');
[2016/02/07 09:30:36] <leyyin> https://i.imgur.com/6Vuf2Ws.gifv
[2016/02/07 09:30:50] <Tobbi> lol.
[2016/02/07 09:31:17] <Tobbi> Guys, can we discuss what we're gonna let the GsoC students work on once I get back and am fed?
[2016/02/07 09:31:24] <mt> sure
[2016/02/07 09:31:30] <Tobbi> So, probably 30-45 minutes.
[2016/02/07 09:31:33] <Tobbi> See you later.
[2016/02/07 09:31:54] <Hume2> OK.
[2016/02/07 09:32:06] <Hume2> I think they could fix that AppVeyor error :D
[2016/02/07 09:32:21] <mt> in that time, sydney_untangle can read the log and tell us what he thinks about GSoC
[2016/02/07 09:33:15] <mt> AppVeyor is silly for some reason
[2016/02/07 09:33:54] <mt> it runs the test suite for my IRC library multiple times: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maxteufel/node-notreallyirc/build/11
[2016/02/07 09:34:43] <mt> (it says 153 tests passed, in reality it's just 31 tests)
[2016/02/07 09:35:00] <Hume2> So it's an AppVeyor's problem, OK.
[2016/02/07 09:36:13] <mt> nah
[2016/02/07 09:36:21] <mt> it's a windows problem, I guess
[2016/02/07 09:36:37] <Hume2> That's more likely.
[2016/02/07 09:37:38] <Hume2> Windows forces the computer to operate with ones, zeros and errors :D

[2016/02/07 10:41:45] <Hume2> Well, it was a bit more.
[2016/02/07 10:41:50] <Tobbi> No problem.
[2016/02/07 10:42:00] <Tobbi> Who wants to participate_
[2016/02/07 10:42:02] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/07 10:42:08] <Tobbi> I mean: In this discussion...
[2016/02/07 10:42:10] <Hume2> I told you to not wait for me.
[2016/02/07 10:42:13] <Hume2> OK
[2016/02/07 10:42:14] <Tobbi> I know.
[2016/02/07 10:43:27] <Hume2> So if anyone wants to be a mentor, then please don't behave like Bernd das Brot.
[2016/02/07 10:43:46] <Hume2> In that case tell someone else to do it instead.
[2016/02/07 10:44:23] <Tobbi> >D
[2016/02/07 10:44:24] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/07 10:44:41] <Tobbi> Hume2: You know Bernd das Brot? :D Was I the one who introduced you to that one?
[2016/02/07 10:44:49] <Hume2> Yes, indeed.
[2016/02/07 10:44:52] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/07 10:44:59] <Tobbi> I am not sure if I can mentor.
[2016/02/07 10:45:08] <Tobbi> I mean 1) I need to make the time commitment...
[2016/02/07 10:45:19] <Tobbi> and 2) Do I actually know enough about the code base?
[2016/02/07 10:45:27] <Hume2> I know that.
[2016/02/07 10:46:00] <Hume2> Therefore I suggest that we all could be mentors.
[2016/02/07 10:46:08] <Tobbi> Mentoring together might work, really.
[2016/02/07 10:46:30] <Hume2> Each mentor could be for another part of SuperTux.
[2016/02/07 10:46:47] <Tobbi> I suggest we should discuss what we want to achieve first
[2016/02/07 10:46:50] <Tobbi> And then we can see...
[2016/02/07 10:47:02] <Hume2> Yes, that'd be better.
[2016/02/07 10:47:12] <Tobbi> I would suggest we do a) 2-player mode.
[2016/02/07 10:47:18] <Tobbi> and b) maybe font engine improvements_
[2016/02/07 10:47:19] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/07 10:47:26] <Tobbi> right? wrong?
[2016/02/07 10:47:27] <Hume2> hmmm…
[2016/02/07 10:47:28] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/07 10:47:34] <Tobbi> mt: Sorry, meeting started.
[2016/02/07 10:47:37] <Tobbi> Ideas?
[2016/02/07 10:47:47] <Hume2> 2-player mode was postponed to 0.6.0, wasn't it?
[2016/02/07 10:48:10] <Hume2> Font improvements could be good.
[2016/02/07 10:49:12] <Tobbi> Hume2: I believe most of the things GSOC students can work on would be for 0.5.0 or 0.6.0.
[2016/02/07 10:49:23] <Tobbi> Hume2: We want the project to be interesting.
[2016/02/07 10:49:52] <Hume2> So we can start with 0.5.0 and then 0.6.0.
[2016/02/07 10:50:20] <Tobbi> I really am not sure which is which.
[2016/02/07 10:50:23] <Hume2> OK, so what's for 0.5.0?
[2016/02/07 10:50:28] <Tobbi> Just saying that we should consider bigger projects.
[2016/02/07 10:50:41] <Tobbi> It doesn't matter if one of them is scheduled for 0.6, because we can reschedule any time.
[2016/02/07 10:50:48] <Hume2> Editor ? :P
[2016/02/07 10:51:09] <Hume2> I didn't want to tell that on the first place.
[2016/02/07 10:51:09] <Tobbi> Hume2: Actually! Flexlay...
[2016/02/07 10:51:24] <Tobbi> That might be a fun project to work on...Problem is: Who mentors that?
[2016/02/07 10:51:35] <Hume2> Karkus, I hope.
[2016/02/07 10:51:44] <Tobbi> Hume2: Does he know enough about the editor?
[2016/02/07 10:51:50] <Tobbi> Also, can he make the time commitment?
[2016/02/07 10:51:56] <Tobbi> I doubt that.
[2016/02/07 10:52:03] <Hume2> I'm not sure.
[2016/02/07 10:52:28] <Hume2> I'd like to mentor the in-game editor or the game mechanism.
[2016/02/07 10:52:44] <Tobbi> Okay, in-game editor can be fun!!! :)

[2016/02/07 10:52:55] <Tobbi> That might be good project...also, that's self-contained.
[2016/02/07 10:52:58] <Tobbi> more or less.
[2016/02/07 10:54:06] <Hume2> The slope sliding could be good too.
[2016/02/07 10:54:30] <Tobbi> Slope sliding?
[2016/02/07 10:54:49] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Do you have anything to contribute?
[2016/02/07 10:55:00] <Hume2> It was decided that this will be implemented.
[2016/02/07 10:55:23] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Can you give me a rough overview of what we are talking about?
[2016/02/07 10:55:32] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Google summer of code.
[2016/02/07 10:55:38] <sydney_untangle> Oh.
[2016/02/07 10:55:49] <sydney_untangle> And what about it?
[2016/02/07 10:55:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: Oh, you mean the belly slide, right? :D
[2016/02/07 10:56:00] <Hume2> Tobbi: Yes, exactly.
[2016/02/07 10:56:06] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: We'd like to participate and wonder what projects the students can work on.
[2016/02/07 10:57:17] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/07 10:57:37] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Oh.
[2016/02/07 10:57:40] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Everything? :D
[2016/02/07 10:57:53] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Everything is not a good description to get people interested.
[2016/02/07 10:58:46] <sydney_untangle> Maybe that Puffin bird, tux swimming, tux belly diving? Not sure what else.
[2016/02/07 10:59:07] <Hume2> Just that.
[2016/02/07 10:59:18] <Hume2> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/292
[2016/02/07 10:59:24] <mt> re time commitment
[2016/02/07 10:59:26] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: So, we have talked about the font thing...migrating to freetype or sdl_ttf, 2-player thing...
[2016/02/07 10:59:34] <mt> we can always assign two mentors to one student
[2016/02/07 10:59:39] <Tobbi> oh, sure.
[2016/02/07 10:59:54] <sydney_untangle> two player would be cool, but i don' see the use of it for this game tbh.
[2016/02/07 11:00:06] <Tobbi> It's a much wanted feature...
[2016/02/07 11:00:19] <mt> sydney_untangle: have you seen multiplayer in the Wii (U) mario games?
[2016/02/07 11:00:35] <mt> it would work
[2016/02/07 11:00:36] <Hume2> *mršidlo
[2016/02/07 11:00:54] <Hume2> We are not mario, are we?
[2016/02/07 11:01:17] <mt> So,
[2016/02/07 11:01:33] <Tobbi> No, we aren't, but this is a universal feature. Hell, if I had any friends, I'd love to play SuperTux with them.
[2016/02/07 11:01:34] <mt> multiplayer: good idea, but it might be too much
[2016/02/07 11:01:40] <Tobbi> probably...
[2016/02/07 11:01:42] <Tobbi> I am not sure.
[2016/02/07 11:01:54] <mt> in-game editor: Hume2 is already working on this
[2016/02/07 11:02:05] <Hume2> mt: well well…
[2016/02/07 11:02:09] @ Quit: lumidify: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2016/02/07 11:02:17] <mt> flexlay: great idea, but might be too easy? since large parts of flexlay already work
[2016/02/07 11:02:57] <mt> but yeah, I guess the font thing, in-game-editor, or multiplayer would be nice ideas
[2016/02/07 11:03:18] <mt> and ideas will also develop when students submit more proposals
[2016/02/07 11:03:29] <Hume2> We shouldn't also think too many features.
[2016/02/07 11:03:37] <mt> yeah
[2016/02/07 11:03:45] <Hume2> I think we should pick the best ones.
[2016/02/07 11:03:47] <mt> I guess two students would be enough
[2016/02/07 11:03:56] <mt> since we need enough mentors
[2016/02/07 11:04:03] <Hume2> Do you think that we'll get more?
[2016/02/07 11:04:07] <Tobbi> mt: Flexlay isn't too easy, not the way we think about it anyway. We have terrain generator, and the add-on packaging thing.
[2016/02/07 11:04:19] <mt> Tobbi: okay
[2016/02/07 11:04:22] <Tobbi> We could delete or export my add-on packaging branch and let them start from scratch...
[2016/02/07 11:04:25] <Tobbi> Not sure.
[2016/02/07 11:05:33] <mt> Hume2: if we get accepted as a project we'll get a lot more students applications than two. I think STK had like, a lot more than 10 applications, but only accepted 3 students
[2016/02/07 11:06:05] <mt> however, students usually do some easy tasks before the actual work, to get to know the project
[2016/02/07 11:06:13] <Hume2> mt: So we only need to be accepted, right?
[2016/02/07 11:06:23] <Tobbi> Students will probably like SuperTux until they start working on the code base :D
[2016/02/07 11:06:28] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/07 11:06:36] <mt> Hume2: yes, I think so
[2016/02/07 11:06:44] <Tobbi> So, actually, we should reconsider not applying :D
[2016/02/07 11:06:53] <mt> however, we should probably spread the word of our GSoC participation
[2016/02/07 11:06:59] <mt> D:
[2016/02/07 11:07:13] <mt> (if we get chosen to be a mentor organization)
[2016/02/07 11:07:29] <Hume2> (I hope so)
[2016/02/07 11:07:48] <Hume2> mt: spreading the world?
[2016/02/07 11:08:15] <Tobbi> Like, on twitter or something.
[2016/02/07 11:08:17] <Tobbi> the forums etc.
[2016/02/07 11:08:56] <Hume2> I could make a TeraTux Reborn walktrough :D
[2016/02/07 11:09:20] <Hume2> Or any other walktrough.
[2016/02/07 11:09:40] <mt> Tobbi: possibly also ask other open-source game projects, maybe there's someone interested
[2016/02/07 11:09:45] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2016/02/07 11:09:46] <mt> I mean heh
[2016/02/07 11:09:50] <mt> the students get paid
[2016/02/07 11:10:45] <Hume2> And who controls the students that they really work?
[2016/02/07 11:10:54] <mt> the mentors
[2016/02/07 11:11:01] <mt> who will also write an evaluation
[2016/02/07 11:11:02] <sydney_untangle> mt: Yes i have, but only in maryo racing
[2016/02/07 11:11:19] <mt> sydney_untangle: of the more supertux-like games
[2016/02/07 11:11:38] <sydney_untangle> No i haven't.
[2016/02/07 11:11:41] <sydney_untangle> Im not much of a gamer.
[2016/02/07 11:11:56] <mt> sydney_untangle: then look on youtube oslt
[2016/02/07 11:13:56] <Hume2> We also have to decide how many mentors we will have.
[2016/02/07 11:14:28] <Hume2> Of course that everyone could do that work, but I guess that Google needs to know that.
[2016/02/07 11:14:36] <mt> for flexlay: preferrably Karkus
[2016/02/07 11:14:46] <mt> for the core: preferrably Tobbi or Hume2
[2016/02/07 11:15:02] <Tobbi> Oh dman.
[2016/02/07 11:15:06] <Tobbi> We need to write evaluations_
[2016/02/07 11:15:06] <mt> I could be backup mentor; sydney_untangle probably too
[2016/02/07 11:15:07] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/07 11:15:13] <Tobbi> I am not that good at this.
[2016/02/07 11:15:16] <mt> yes
[2016/02/07 11:15:46] <mt> http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsoc-mentoring/evaluations/
[2016/02/07 11:15:50] <sydney_untangle> I'm no good with the code, but i know a couple things. mt would be better in my opinion for backup though.
[2016/02/07 11:16:08] <mt> sydney_untangle: but at least you can point people to the right things
[2016/02/07 11:16:27] <mt> possibly for core or backup mentors: old contributors
[2016/02/07 11:16:48] <mt> and I don't know what about maths22, haven't seen him talking in here for a long time
[2016/02/07 11:16:55] <sydney_untangle> Yes, i think im capable of that.
[2016/02/07 11:17:11] <Tobbi> mt: I assume he's busy with college.
[2016/02/07 11:17:19] <Tobbi> I don't think he'd leave the project like this.
[2016/02/07 11:17:26] <Tobbi> or high school or whatever.
[2016/02/07 11:18:30] <mt> oh good idea
[2016/02/07 11:18:40] <mt> we should fix the windows build
[2016/02/07 11:18:51] <mt> because I think there's many people using Windows
[2016/02/07 11:19:55] <Tobbi> mt: It's got something to do with an include file that is missing for some reason.
[2016/02/07 11:20:16] <mt> can we easily disable tinygettext?
[2016/02/07 11:20:29] <Tobbi> I am not sure.
[2016/02/07 11:20:31] <mt> so that we have a working, english-only build?
[2016/02/07 11:20:40] <Tobbi> I don't think we can.
[2016/02/07 11:20:57] <mt> would possibly need a fallback _() call that just returns the given arguments
[2016/02/07 11:21:17] <mt> and those called in the language menu
[2016/02/07 11:23:16] <Tobbi> yup.
[2016/02/07 11:23:35] <mt> let's debug appveyor
[2016/02/07 11:23:46] <mt> since when has this been happening? (what commit)

[2016/02/07 11:25:49] <Tobbi> mt: I think I have a regression range, or had one for that matter.

[2016/02/07 11:27:33] <Hume2> OK, should the mentors register anywhere?
[2016/02/07 11:28:48] <mt> I don't get it
[2016/02/07 11:29:19] <mt> this line hasn't been added recently
[2016/02/07 11:29:21] <Hume2> Can just someone say that he's the mentor or he needs to tell it to Google first?
[2016/02/07 11:30:21] <mt> Ask Google's docs
[2016/02/07 11:30:41] <Tobbi> mt: I believe the issue is buried somewhere in that subproject setup.
[2016/02/07 11:30:59] <Tobbi> iirc, the issue first occurred when maths22 did something to the cmake subprojects
[2016/02/07 11:31:53] <Hume2> I think so.

[2016/02/07 11:34:56] <Hume2> I wouldn't like that.

[2016/02/07 11:54:18] <Hume2> Tobbi: You shouldn't hesitate.
[2016/02/07 11:54:18] <Tobbi> mt: What I did to tinygettext was: Include the latest upstream changes in the upstream branch.
[2016/02/07 11:54:22] <Tobbi> And point to that.
[2016/02/07 11:54:35] <Tobbi> Did you change anything in tinygettext's master_
[2016/02/07 11:54:36] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/07 11:55:13] <mt> I told git to use tinygettext/master
[2016/02/07 11:55:18] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/02/07 11:55:26] <Tobbi> Shouldn't fix the build, but might be a necessary thing.
[2016/02/07 11:55:28] <mt> meh
[2016/02/07 11:55:45] <mt> well, the SuperTux/tinygettext master
[2016/02/07 11:56:08] <mt> but since it was broken before you changed it to upstream
[2016/02/07 11:56:12] <mt> it's probably useless
[2016/02/07 11:57:14] <Tobbi> That's what I meant.
[2016/02/07 11:57:58] <mt> however
[2016/02/07 11:58:07] <mt> "Fix build" and "Fix build (again)"
[2016/02/07 11:58:10] <mt> interesting
[2016/02/07 11:58:22] <mt> these aren't in the master branch
[2016/02/07 11:58:26] <mt> but it still builds fine
[2016/02/07 11:59:23] <Tobbi> mt: Those are things I didn't spot during rebasing with upstream tinygettext.

[2016/02/07 11:59:44] <Tobbi> Thanks, Hume2.
[2016/02/07 12:00:00] <mt> you can mention people in commit messages btw
[2016/02/07 12:00:11] <mt> so 'Fixed @tobbi's werror'
[2016/02/07 12:00:17] <Hume2> Travis complains even when the parameter shadows but still can distinguish those variables.
[2016/02/07 12:00:18] <mt> should mention tobbi on github
[2016/02/07 12:00:37] <Tobbi> That's weird. It doesn't shadow, since I prefixed one with this->
[2016/02/07 12:00:40] <Tobbi> but, hey, who cares.
[2016/02/07 12:00:55] <Hume2> Tobbi: Travis would complain anyway.

[2016/02/08 10:43:21] <ElementW> I was talking to uwjesq about Supertux before mentioning the chan name
[2016/02/08 10:43:21] <mt> hi ElementW
[2016/02/08 10:43:26] <ElementW> Hi mt
[2016/02/08 10:43:28] <mt> what's up?
[2016/02/08 10:43:35] <sydney_untangle> Ah. And welcome to the channel ElementW.
[2016/02/08 10:43:39] <ElementW> :)
[2016/02/08 10:44:18] <ElementW> So I wanted to ask
[2016/02/08 10:44:37] <ElementW> has anyone worked on a GL(ES) 2.0 renderer for ST so far?
[2016/02/08 10:44:55] @ uwjesq joined channel #supertux

[2016/02/08 10:45:39] <uwjesq> How are you doing?
[2016/02/08 10:46:11] <mt> ElementW: Until just right now I didn't know what that is so I guess no
[2016/02/08 10:46:14] <sydney_untangle> uwjesq: Good, you?
[2016/02/08 10:46:37] <mt> /* contributions are always welcome */
[2016/02/08 10:46:40] <uwjesq> sydney_untangle: Great.
[2016/02/08 10:46:55] <ElementW> Prepare for PR impact someday then :D

[2016/02/08 10:47:15] <mt> out of curiosity, how did you find this channel?
[2016/02/08 10:48:02] <ElementW> DDG "supertux" -> github -> wiki -> contact
[2016/02/08 10:48:09] <ElementW> Also common sense for FLOSS projects.
[2016/02/08 10:48:45] <mt> and how did you find supertux?
[2016/02/08 10:49:12] <ElementW> Knew about it long ago, forgot, go to university in the meantime, friend plays it for the lulz
[2016/02/08 10:49:27] <ElementW> That's the story so far.
[2016/02/08 10:49:51] <mt> speaking of university: you might be interested in the fact that we're considering applying as a GSoC mentoring organization this year
[2016/02/08 10:50:33] <uwjesq> ElementW: This looks much better https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvmWz0ou_sc
[2016/02/08 10:50:59] <ElementW> uwjesq: indeed this is waaaaaaay more up to date
[2016/02/08 10:51:27] <mt> oh you didn't know about the new stable release?
[2016/02/08 10:51:47] <ElementW> Not even
[2016/02/08 10:52:01] <mt> the new release 0.4.0 is quite different compared to 0.1.3

[2016/02/08 10:53:06] <uwjesq> Oops.
[2016/02/08 10:53:19] <ElementW> >:D uwjesq
[2016/02/08 10:53:20] <mt> ElementW: it a) contains all the images and music and b) contains all the change history since 2000
[2016/02/08 10:53:57] <ElementW> You should've split code and data
[2016/02/08 10:54:16] <ElementW> So you do a full source clone but only a shallow data clone
[2016/02/08 10:54:21] <mt> in fact, some months ago we've tried splitting of the data directory
[2016/02/08 10:54:34] <ElementW> this way you get source history but not always past assets you might not need
[2016/02/08 10:54:43] <mt> but for some reason, it didn't work out and the change was reverted
[2016/02/08 10:54:54] <ElementW> uwjesq: Talk about your experience
[2016/02/08 10:55:00] <ElementW> How I destructed your repo :P
[2016/02/08 10:55:06] <uwjesq> mt: What was the problem?
[2016/02/08 10:55:17] <mt> uwjesq: I don't know
[2016/02/08 10:55:24] <mt> I think it was related to the build system
[2016/02/08 10:55:29] <uwjesq> mt: We did the same thing and cloning finaly is fun again.
[2016/02/08 10:55:44] <uwjesq> mt: How did you try to link the data? By submodules?
[2016/02/08 10:55:52] <mt> Yeah using a submodule
[2016/02/08 10:56:59] <ElementW> 132 MiB and counting...
[2016/02/08 10:57:15] <mt> afc26e0 introduced the change, 59ede11 reverted it
[2016/02/08 10:57:16] <uwjesq> mt: Submodule is the way to go.
[2016/02/08 10:58:03] <sydney_untangle> ElementW: It is quite large. IIRC its pushing 200MB.
[2016/02/08 10:58:09] <uwjesq> mt: The build system should not be affected since to it it makes no difference.
[2016/02/08 10:58:20] <ElementW> uwjesq and I went full idiot (but effective) and rewrote the whole history so the source repo "data" directory never happened.
[2016/02/08 10:58:37] <uwjesq> ElementW: Good times.
[2016/02/08 10:58:50] <uwjesq> mt: We removed binary data from the history, too.

[2016/02/08 10:59:57] <mt> But I don't know anymore
[2016/02/08 11:00:03] <ElementW> mt: IIRC it didn't
[2016/02/08 11:00:07] <ElementW> I was in charge of doing it
[2016/02/08 11:00:13] <ElementW> and nothing was broken
[2016/02/08 11:00:31] <mt> also, rewriting the history that far back is something I don't want
[2016/02/08 11:00:38] <Hume2> Excuse me please now, I should eat something.
[2016/02/08 11:00:54] <Hume2> I didn't plan that, discuss without me.
[2016/02/08 11:01:10] <mt> Hume2: I'm not sure we'll talk about GSoC now anyway

[2016/02/08 11:08:51] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/data/issues/2 is the problem why the change was reverted. However, since the data repo has been deleted, the issue isn't there anymore

[2016/02/08 11:10:21] <mt> Tobbi: why has the data submodule been removed?
[2016/02/08 11:10:28] <mt> We've been wondering about that right now
[2016/02/08 11:10:42] <Tobbi> mt: Because someone (I think it was grumbel) claimed that the history won't be kept intact.
[2016/02/08 11:10:55] <Tobbi> So, since we want that history, it's been revrted.
[2016/02/08 11:10:59] <uwjesq> ElementW: Big improvments in graphics, sound and animation here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFy2SNA3zVA
[2016/02/08 11:11:58] <mt> Tobbi: also, re dirent.h: I'd rather make that work without adding dirent.h, as that worked before as well
[2016/02/08 11:12:00] <Tobbi> Who are ElementW and uwjesq?
[2016/02/08 11:12:07] <ElementW> Tobbi: new guys
[2016/02/08 11:12:15] <ElementW> Coming from ##glportal
[2016/02/08 11:12:21] <Tobbi> mt: I *know*, but in order to get a working windows build, this was necessary...
[2016/02/08 11:12:31] <Tobbi> Feel free to fix the underlying issue. I don't know how.
[2016/02/08 11:12:41] <Tobbi> ElementW, uwjesq: Welcome. :)
[2016/02/08 11:13:24] <uwjesq> Thanks.
[2016/02/08 11:14:07] <uwjesq> Tobbi: Yes. You ruin your history and have to keep a seperate repository to keep your old tags intact.
[2016/02/08 11:14:25] <Tobbi> Yeah, so, let's keep it...
[2016/02/08 11:14:47] <ElementW> PSA: the current repo clone size is 320.73 MiB
[2016/02/08 11:14:48] <uwjesq> Tobbi: I still think it is a better option than keep the main repository broken.
[2016/02/08 11:14:51] <mt> Tobbi: (these people told us they've been rewriting the entire history of their project to remove their data dir)
[2016/02/08 11:15:03] <uwjesq> Tobbi: But I am speaking for myself.
[2016/02/08 11:15:04] <Tobbi> mt: Ouch, that's not a good solution.
[2016/02/08 11:15:20] <Tobbi> Actually, didn't we want to talk about GSoC?

[2016/02/08 11:24:59] <sydney_untangle> Hrm.

[2016/02/08 11:25:51] <Tobbi> Okay, no matter what I do I am getting a 403 error.
[2016/02/08 11:26:19] <Tobbi> I tried registering with two different e-mail addresses.
[2016/02/08 11:26:31] <Tobbi> Hopefully, that doesn't mean I won't be able to register with those again...
[2016/02/08 11:26:46] <mt> maybe we should wait

[2016/02/08 11:39:50] <Tobbi> grr...
[2016/02/08 11:39:52] <sydney_untangle> mt: And why pick on him? Why not pick on the tens of other canidates?
[2016/02/08 11:40:02] <Tobbi> leyyin: You probably wouldn't have said that if I hadn't said anything.
[2016/02/08 11:40:08] <leyyin> MAKING MERICA GREAT AGAIN
[2016/02/08 11:40:10] <leyyin> BOOM BOOM
[2016/02/08 11:40:10] <Tobbi> Actually, was that grammatically correct?
[2016/02/08 11:40:17] <mt> sydney_untangle: do you realize he's racist, and all whatever? anyway, this is not the channel for these discussions
[2016/02/08 11:40:29] <leyyin> look at what I started
[2016/02/08 11:40:44] <mt> Tobbi: well then
[2016/02/08 11:40:45] <leyyin> I should overthrow governments for a living
[2016/02/08 11:40:49] <Tobbi> mt: haha, you actually caught yourself being off-topic. If I had started this discussion, you'd have set <insert weird mode here> on the channel.
[2016/02/08 11:40:52] <mt> you can apply this evening if you want

[2016/02/08 11:42:11] <mt> okay
[2016/02/08 11:42:16] <leyyin> okay
[2016/02/08 11:42:18] <mt> now we can end that discussion
[2016/02/08 11:42:34] <leyyin> only way to end the discussion is to kick me
[2016/02/08 11:42:55] <sydney_untangle> Fine.
[2016/02/08 11:42:58] <Tobbi> leyyin: Don't provoke it.
[2016/02/08 11:43:09] <leyyin> gimme your best shot :P
[2016/02/08 11:43:24] * Tobbi gives leyyin a shot of adrenaline.
[2016/02/08 11:43:26] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Ify ou ignore him he will be quiet...
[2016/02/08 11:43:36] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I don't care... :D

[2016/02/08 11:43:45] <Tobbi> leyyin: What about dropshots?

[2016/02/08 11:44:01] <leyyin> is that mute?
[2016/02/08 11:44:10] <mt> (it will make you not receive any channel messages)
[2016/02/08 11:44:12] <Tobbi> mt: If you want to make channel mode jokes, do it where people are knowledgeable about the topic.
[2016/02/08 11:44:41] <mt> okay
[2016/02/08 11:44:45] <Tobbi> Here, people will be just like "okay, thanks mt, whatever, let the weird guy talk" and those jokes won't have any effect.
[2016/02/08 11:45:06] <mt> can we end the off-topic discussion now really?
[2016/02/08 11:45:14] <mt> Instead of making silly suggestions
[2016/02/08 11:45:25] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2016/02/08 11:45:42] <sydney_untangle> Im shocked Stallman if for abortion. He doesn't like having lives spied on, but doesn't care if they die without having their own choice on life. How sad.
[2016/02/08 11:46:01] * leyyin grabs popcorn
[2016/02/08 11:46:23] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Can i have some as well? And don't forget the salt. :D
[2016/02/08 11:46:32] <mt> sydney_untangle: please drop it
[2016/02/08 11:46:47] <mt> that's also a political view
[2016/02/08 11:46:57] <Tobbi> haha.
[2016/02/08 11:46:58] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, stallman is all about freedom, it makes sense imho
[2016/02/08 11:47:02] <Tobbi> I wasn't the one who started it...
[2016/02/08 11:47:08] <sydney_untangle> mt: fine.
[2016/02/08 11:47:13] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: But it doesn't make sense.
[2016/02/08 11:47:16] <leyyin> stallman wants freedom in everything
[2016/02/08 11:47:21] <leyyin> to everyone
[2016/02/08 11:47:45] <mt> now: all the people who are available should be here, 20:00 UTC+1 for discussing GSoC
[2016/02/08 11:47:52] <Tobbi> yes.
[2016/02/08 11:48:01] <mt> until then, we can have an off-topic discussion
[2016/02/08 11:48:18] <leyyin> soo, did you see the super bowl?
[2016/02/08 11:48:27] <leyyin> me neither, the rest of the world does not care :P
[2016/02/08 11:48:34] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: If he wants freedome to everyone, he would be against abortion, because being killed by your mom because of her poor choice doesn't seem correct.
[2016/02/08 11:48:36] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Okay, assuming the woman got pregnant due to rape, so she never wanted to have the child in the first place...
[2016/02/08 11:48:44] <Tobbi> Are you still not okay with abortion?
[2016/02/08 11:49:06] <leyyin> soo sydney_untangle, you are pro-life and pro-guns?
[2016/02/08 11:49:24] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: So what, its still a life, if they want to commit suicide later in life thats their choice, but when they are a baby...
[2016/02/08 11:49:34] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi leyyin YES!
[2016/02/08 11:49:55] <leyyin> you are contradicting yourself
[2016/02/08 11:50:05] <leyyin> discussion ends here for me
[2016/02/08 11:50:10] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: At which point does life start for you. I mean: Ovum and sperm cells were alive before that...
[2016/02/08 11:50:22] <sydney_untangle> We should ban TVs and make everyone register TVs because they kill more people by falling that guns do...
[2016/02/08 11:50:33] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/02/08 11:50:43] <Tobbi> And, yes, this time: *sigh* is appropriate.
[2016/02/08 11:50:43] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Its true though.
[2016/02/08 11:50:57] <Tobbi> Can this get merged? https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/363
[2016/02/08 11:51:02] <Tobbi> Can anyone test this?
[2016/02/08 11:51:29] * sydney_untangle is thinking...
[2016/02/08 11:51:33] <Tobbi> Okay, since no one volunteers, I will...
[2016/02/08 11:51:56] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, https://youtu.be/vZijLQGH1v0 :P
[2016/02/08 11:51:59] <leyyin> kinda NSFW
[2016/02/08 11:52:13] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I consider it to be a child at conception...
[2016/02/08 11:52:21] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: No youtube videos.
[2016/02/08 11:52:44] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Haven't i told you i don't like google as it is, and you are still forcing youtube upon me.
[2016/02/08 11:52:45] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: What makes the connection of sperm and ovum so different than the parts alone.
[2016/02/08 11:52:52] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/08 11:53:17] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, I do not care really :P
[2016/02/08 11:53:24] <mt> oh my god the pro-life idiots
[2016/02/08 11:53:39] <leyyin> mt, heathen :P
[2016/02/08 11:53:42] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/08 11:53:45] <Tobbi> haha...
[2016/02/08 11:53:45] <sydney_untangle> Good grief, this is going no where...
[2016/02/08 11:53:53] <sydney_untangle> mt: Thanks for calling me an idiot.
[2016/02/08 11:54:00] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I just asked you a question...Answer it?
[2016/02/08 11:54:23] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: No, because we have been over this before.
[2016/02/08 11:54:32] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: *sigh* Okay, okay.
[2016/02/08 11:54:48] <leyyin> no one will change their minds on this topic
[2016/02/08 11:54:50] <leyyin> soo move along
[2016/02/08 11:55:00] <Tobbi> leyyin: It's the same with the refugee crisis...
[2016/02/08 11:55:06] <Tobbi> mt: Your opinion regarding that, anyway?
[2016/02/08 11:55:20] <leyyin> Tobbi, Germany is to blame....
[2016/02/08 11:55:50] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yeah, that's true. But I think it'll all work out eventually... We just need to be strict enough.
[2016/02/08 11:56:08] <leyyin> I do no care a bout backwards american thinking, sydney_untangle you can think what you want, you do not live in Europe :D
[2016/02/08 11:56:13] <mt> re heathen: I'm sad to inform everyone who interprets religious texts literally that they suffer from unreflected obedience.
[2016/02/08 11:56:22] <Tobbi> I think the majority of them are willing to adapt to the culture, so yeah...
[2016/02/08 11:56:38] <mt> I think that we should help the refugees who need help
[2016/02/08 11:57:01] <mt> And we can't send them back to a place where they'd die, even if they're criminals here
[2016/02/08 11:57:01] <leyyin> and mantain the freaking borders
[2016/02/08 11:57:03] <Tobbi> mt: What about people who believe in the bible because it gives them hope or guidance? Isn't that worth fighting for?
[2016/02/08 11:57:29] <mt> But I also think that other EU countries should help refugees
[2016/02/08 11:57:38] <mt> (UK, FR, ...)
[2016/02/08 11:57:39] <Tobbi> I mean: You can't judge people for believing stupid things, if it makes them feel better?...oh, sorry for jumping topics here...
[2016/02/08 11:58:01] <mt> 'literally' 'unreflected'
[2016/02/08 11:58:38] <Tobbi> mt: My mother was religious, and I was grown up with the idea of believing in god...I never questioned it...
[2016/02/08 11:58:46] <Tobbi> So, do you call me stupid, only because I adapted?
[2016/02/08 11:58:55] <leyyin> mt, I disagree, get the criminal scum out of Europe
[2016/02/08 11:59:09] <leyyin> a part of them are not even from Syria
[2016/02/08 11:59:27] <mt> I'd call that unreflected obedience, not stupid. And children might be different, since they can't really think about stuff yet
[2016/02/08 11:59:33] <leyyin> and the legit ones do not get the help that they deserve
[2016/02/08 12:00:24] <Tobbi> mt: There were a lot of people who followed what Hitler said about stuff, because he had charisma. Can you judge people for that?
[2016/02/08 12:00:35] <leyyin> yes :D
[2016/02/08 12:00:45] <leyyin> people are stupid
[2016/02/08 12:00:47] <Tobbi> leyyin: C'mon group psychology...
[2016/02/08 12:00:56] <leyyin> my point = people are stupid
[2016/02/08 12:01:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: If I am too afraid to speak out loud... and just follow the crowd?
[2016/02/08 12:01:08] <Tobbi> Does that mean I am stupid?
[2016/02/08 12:01:20] <leyyin> yes, if you followed Hitler
[2016/02/08 12:01:27] <leyyin> or Trump, same thing :P
[2016/02/08 12:01:41] <Tobbi> leyyin: But group psychology is everywhere...Some things are hidden beneath the covers...Things we don't know about...
[2016/02/08 12:02:08] <Tobbi> And how will I ever get a reflected opinion when I don't know the truth.
[2016/02/08 12:02:19] <leyyin> try to think for yourself
[2016/02/08 12:02:43] <Tobbi> leyyin: I don't know anything about thinking :P
[2016/02/08 12:02:45] <Tobbi> Okay, this gets old.
[2016/02/08 12:03:06] <mt> well: I think people who think <stuff we discussed> and then also think freedom allows them to do everything, that's not okay
[2016/02/08 12:03:08] <Tobbi> leyyin: I guess the truth is somewhere in the middle probably...
[2016/02/08 12:03:21] <Tobbi> Maybe it depends on the situation.
[2016/02/08 12:03:27] <mt> many americans seem to think freedom allows them to do everything, just because they believe in it
[2016/02/08 12:03:48] <leyyin> most americans who folow Trump want fascism imho
[2016/02/08 12:03:57] <leyyin> not democracy
[2016/02/08 12:04:05] <Tobbi> mt: Problem with the concept of freedom is that stupid people do stupid things...
[2016/02/08 12:04:09] <Tobbi> We should protect them from doing it.
[2016/02/08 12:04:17] <Tobbi> Even smart people do stupid things.
[2016/02/08 12:04:52] <mt> well, freedom only can be freedom as long as it doesn't hurt other's freedom
[2016/02/08 12:05:00] <mt> if people still do stupid things then
[2016/02/08 12:05:05] <mt> that's their problem
[2016/02/08 12:05:05] <leyyin> soo, anarchy? :D
[2016/02/08 12:05:26] <mt> leyyin: no, that doesn't imply that
[2016/02/08 12:05:46] <sydney_untangle> *facepalm*, what have i started...
[2016/02/08 12:05:58] <mt> oh welcome back sydney_untangle
[2016/02/08 12:06:12] <mt> also re stallmans opionion on FOSS
[2016/02/08 12:06:19] <mt> I don't even agree with him on that
[2016/02/08 12:06:29] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I cannot seed anything on my internet speed, eh? Ive seeded 30GB over the past week.
[2016/02/08 12:06:38] <mt> BSD is real software freedom
[2016/02/08 12:06:40] <leyyin> do you want something seeded Tobbi ?
[2016/02/08 12:06:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: No? :D
[2016/02/08 12:06:56] <mt> >torrents
[2016/02/08 12:07:05] <mt> nope, thanks. at least here in Germany
[2016/02/08 12:07:18] <leyyin> I seed STK like crazy, I have the windows torrent ratio at 842 :D
[2016/02/08 12:07:22] <mt> (unless you want to receive an Abmahnung)
[2016/02/08 12:07:33] <leyyin> mt, you can't use torrents in germany?
[2016/02/08 12:07:34] <sydney_untangle> mt: I do agree with him to an extent, but he does push it a little too far.
[2016/02/08 12:07:46] <Tobbi> mt: Depends on what you seed.
[2016/02/08 12:07:54] <mt> leyyin: well for open source stuff it works
[2016/02/08 12:08:19] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: 842 times? o_O
[2016/02/08 12:08:26] <mt> but as soon as someone else sees you downloading illegal stuff they're allowed to ask a lawyer to send you an Abmahnung
[2016/02/08 12:08:29] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, that is low
[2016/02/08 12:08:45] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Ive seeded it 9 times, and that seems like alot for me. whopee. :p

[2016/02/08 12:09:22] <Tobbi> if I did that.
[2016/02/08 12:09:28] <sydney_untangle> lol.

[2016/02/08 12:11:00] <leyyin> sucks to live in Germany :/
[2016/02/08 12:11:00] <mt> some employees apparently told them they could continue
[2016/02/08 12:11:03] <leyyin> torrents are my life

[2016/02/08 12:12:13] <sydney_untangle> Hehe, same here.
[2016/02/08 12:12:16] <leyyin> lumidify, FLOSS movie?
[2016/02/08 12:12:35] <sydney_untangle> WHo watches movies? :p
[2016/02/08 12:12:37] <leyyin> or FLOSS music?
[2016/02/08 12:12:37] <lumidify> Programmers don't have a life, so they don't need movies.
[2016/02/08 12:12:48] <lumidify> *REAL programmers
[2016/02/08 12:12:53] <mt> You don't have a life then, apparently
[2016/02/08 12:13:00] * sydney_untangle hasn't watched a movie in a long time...
[2016/02/08 12:13:04] <leyyin> or books....
[2016/02/08 12:13:11] * sydney_untangle hasn't looked at a tv in a long time...
[2016/02/08 12:13:13] <leyyin> freaking DRM amazon, no thanks

[2016/02/08 12:13:46] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: At $1.29 a song, that is outrageous...
[2016/02/08 12:14:02] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, especially for eastern european salaries
[2016/02/08 12:14:09] <leyyin> the prices are not adapted for the local market
[2016/02/08 12:14:20] <sydney_untangle> And does me buying a song even support the band?
[2016/02/08 12:14:22] * sydney_untangle nods...
[2016/02/08 12:14:44] <leyyin> media companies still wonder why people pirate, because pirating is easy than legally doing it
[2016/02/08 12:14:53] <leyyin> when they make legally doing it more easier, I will do it
[2016/02/08 12:15:16] <sydney_untangle> Or cheaper at least.
[2016/02/08 12:15:24] <leyyin> netflix in Romania, crap
[2016/02/08 12:15:41] <leyyin> or netflix outside USA, it is pure crap
[2016/02/08 12:15:50] <leyyin> 90% of the content is not there
[2016/02/08 12:15:55] <leyyin> and you pay the same price or higher

[2016/02/08 12:21:25] <Tobbi> Hello Karkus.
[2016/02/08 12:21:27] <Tobbi> You're on time.
[2016/02/08 12:21:29] <Tobbi> actually...
[2016/02/08 12:21:34] <Karkus> Hello, Tobbi, sydney_untangle
[2016/02/08 12:21:44] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, we were thinking about applying for GSoC
[2016/02/08 12:21:55] <Tobbi> Applications open in 1 hour and 30 minutes approx.
[2016/02/08 12:22:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Google Summer of Code?
[2016/02/08 12:22:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: Correct.
[2016/02/08 12:22:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: What would that involve?
[2016/02/08 12:22:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: Uhm, we need projects for the students to work on, we'd need to write evaluations...
[2016/02/08 12:23:20] <Tobbi> Anything else...Uh?
[2016/02/08 12:23:27] <Tobbi> mt: Anything else we need to do?
[2016/02/08 12:24:02] <sydney_untangle> mt: A couple days ago i was talking to a friend, and he was trying to tell me that even though this certian company says in their privacy policy that they can do pretty much what they want if you install their program, that they won't do anything at all...
[2016/02/08 12:24:27] <sydney_untangle> That was quite the convo, to say the least.
[2016/02/08 12:25:03] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: We need to actually document what needs to be done? ;p we have never done that before. ;p
[2016/02/08 12:25:21] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I think it would make sense. We can have a look once the registrations are open.
[2016/02/08 12:25:34] <sydney_untangle> Yes, it does make sense
[2016/02/08 12:25:50] <Tobbi> Let's have a look at what's required...
[2016/02/08 12:27:47] <Tobbi> Okay, guys, I will go buy some groceries and some guns... and then I'll be back...
[2016/02/08 12:28:09] <Tobbi> Oh, did I say guns, I meant something completely different...
[2016/02/08 12:28:10] <Tobbi> :P

[2016/02/08 12:56:06] <Karkus> Tobbi: I am willing to help you out, but I don't think I'd like to be a mentor for Flexlay when its at this stage, and I don't have enough experience with SuperTux itself.
[2016/02/08 12:56:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: No problem. We'll just not do flexlay then.
[2016/02/08 12:57:28] <mt> Yeah
[2016/02/08 12:57:32] <mt> Sounds okay as well
[2016/02/08 12:57:51] <mt> Karkus: do you have any ideas for students?
[2016/02/08 12:58:04] <mt> I guess it should be kinda challenging, but not too hard
[2016/02/08 12:59:16] <Karkus> Maybe something to do with scripting? Or the menus (which are a bit ugly atm)?
[2016/02/08 13:01:31] <Tobbi> Refreshing the GUI is fun.
[2016/02/08 13:01:41] <Tobbi> or sure sounds like it
[2016/02/08 13:02:11] <Tobbi> 1 hour until registration opens.
[2016/02/08 13:02:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: What do we need to have in the application
[2016/02/08 13:02:51] <Karkus> ?
[2016/02/08 13:02:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: Not sure yet.
[2016/02/08 13:03:03] <Tobbi> We'll have to see that once they are open.
[2016/02/08 13:03:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: Surely we can look at last years then plan what we're going to put?

[2016/02/08 13:16:25] <Tobbi> but who cares.
[2016/02/08 13:16:45] <mt> nononono
[2016/02/08 13:16:53] <mt> don't create a wiki page in the github wiki
[2016/02/08 13:17:21] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/02/08 13:17:36] <mt> use https://github.com/supertux/wiki and push to that's origin/master and to https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux.wiki.git
[2016/02/08 13:17:48] <Tobbi> I'm gonna delete the page then.
[2016/02/08 13:18:00] <mt> that will also write git history
[2016/02/08 13:18:08] <mt> it will be overwritten by a force push
[2016/02/08 13:18:14] <mt> so create the file in the wiki repo
[2016/02/08 13:18:27] <mt> and also push it to the supertux.wiki repo
[2016/02/08 13:19:25] <Tobbi> mt: Actually, you can do it.
[2016/02/08 13:19:50] <mt> so now you deleted it?
[2016/02/08 13:19:56] <mt> did you have anything on that page?
[2016/02/08 13:20:32] <leyyin> what, github wiki can e connected to another repo? :D
[2016/02/08 13:20:38] <leyyin> TIL
[2016/02/08 13:20:41] <Tobbi> mt: No, I don't.
[2016/02/08 13:20:49] <mt> leyyin: the github wiki is a git repo
[2016/02/08 13:20:54] <mt> and because we don't want spam
[2016/02/08 13:21:07] <leyyin> you can edit the wiki directly there?
[2016/02/08 13:21:08] <mt> but still allow others to contribute, we manage the wiki in a separate repo
[2016/02/08 13:21:19] <mt> where people can pull request
[2016/02/08 13:21:37] <mt> and once there are changes, they will also be pushed to the hidden github wiki repo
[2016/02/08 13:21:52] <Karkus> mt: Automatically?
[2016/02/08 13:21:57] <mt> no

[2016/02/08 13:28:59] <Tobbi> mt: So, what ideas did we have?
[2016/02/08 13:32:11] <mt> multiplayer
[2016/02/08 13:32:38] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2016/02/08 13:32:51] <mt> font improvements (TTF, ...)
[2016/02/08 13:34:45] <mt> Earlier today ElementW asked if OpenGL ES was supported. I don't think it is, so that could be a project too.
[2016/02/08 13:35:04] <ElementW> GL(ES) 2.0 especially
[2016/02/08 13:35:13] <ElementW> Because fixed pipeline is the bane of my existence
[2016/02/08 13:35:40] <Tobbi> GL(ES)? GL for embedded systems?
[2016/02/08 13:35:44] <Tobbi> What would that include_
[2016/02/08 13:35:47] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/08 13:36:10] <ElementW> The ES part is mainly to target low-profile GPUs
[2016/02/08 13:36:14] <ElementW> if you support GL ES 2
[2016/02/08 13:36:20] <ElementW> you support GL 2
[2016/02/08 13:36:22] <Tobbi> ah ok
[2016/02/08 13:36:32] <ElementW> (with some changes between the 2)
[2016/02/08 13:36:42] <ElementW> (mainly shader preprocessor source)
[2016/02/08 13:36:51] <mt> well, a standard OpenGL renderer is already available (see the --renderer option)
[2016/02/08 13:37:00] <mt> would it be hard to then add GL ES?
[2016/02/08 13:37:07] <ElementW> Nope
[2016/02/08 13:37:25] <ElementW> But the current GL renderer is a fixed-pipeline GL 1.0 renderer
[2016/02/08 13:37:31] <ElementW> and GL 1.0 is slow as f!ck
[2016/02/08 13:37:36] <ElementW> (relatively)
[2016/02/08 13:37:47] <Tobbi> Our GL renderer is using opengl 1.0?
[2016/02/08 13:37:56] <ElementW> Yes.
[2016/02/08 13:37:59] <ElementW> Immediate mode calls
[2016/02/08 13:38:04] <ElementW> you pass vertex info 1 by 1
[2016/02/08 13:38:07] <Tobbi> Okay, so that should be changed, right?
[2016/02/08 13:38:12] <ElementW> Yes.
[2016/02/08 13:38:26] <ElementW> you can keep the legacy GL 1.0 backend though
[2016/02/08 13:38:43] <ElementW> just start the new one with a copypasta of GL 1.0, edit to make GL(ES) 2.0

[2016/02/08 13:39:18] <ElementW> Oh in the same vein of ideas and statements, Wayland support isn't coming for you if you stick to GLEW.
[2016/02/08 13:39:20] <Tobbi> Someone else can format that or add stuff...
[2016/02/08 13:39:30] <Tobbi> Oh.
[2016/02/08 13:39:37] <Tobbi> So we *should* switch to GLbinding.
[2016/02/08 13:39:40] <Tobbi> right?
[2016/02/08 13:39:48] <ElementW> don't know GLBinding
[2016/02/08 13:39:57] <Tobbi> ElementW: What else is there?
[2016/02/08 13:40:07] <ElementW> libepoxy
[2016/02/08 13:40:31] <ElementW> EGL support is what you're aiming for max "portability" here
[2016/02/08 13:40:31] @ Wuzzy joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/08 13:40:33] <ElementW> GLX is X only
[2016/02/08 13:40:39] <ElementW> WGL is windows only
[2016/02/08 13:40:42] <ElementW> EGL is cross platform
[2016/02/08 13:40:45] <Tobbi> This is GLbinding https://github.com/cginternals/glbinding
[2016/02/08 13:41:34] <ElementW> Oh that is pretty cool
[2016/02/08 13:41:37] <ElementW> sure you can use that
[2016/02/08 13:42:55] <Tobbi> ElementW: This is not you, is it? https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/323
[2016/02/08 13:43:17] <ElementW> Tobbi: nah, but I saw this issue
[2016/02/08 13:43:19] <mt> Wayland... I like that someone finally wants to replace the decades-old X11 stuff. What annoys me with it is that they don't seem to be willing to add *BSD support :(
[2016/02/08 13:43:20] <Tobbi> ok.
[2016/02/08 13:43:51] <Tobbi> oh! I never heard about wayland before.
[2016/02/08 13:44:03] <ElementW> mt: officially no BSD support yes, but it's still fairly portable
[2016/02/08 13:44:24] <ElementW> Wayland itself only relies on POSIX shm and UNIX sockets
[2016/02/08 13:44:28] <mt> I've seen in 2013 there was some patches, but they weren't tested apparently
[2016/02/08 13:45:26] <Tobbi> What does Canonical have against Wayland?
[2016/02/08 13:45:31] <mt> Well, if it's not systemd-like: 'We're not interested in *BSD stuff even if you write it for us' it's okay. But I don't know much about Wayland.
[2016/02/08 13:46:03] <mt> Canonical also disliked systemd and used upstart until Debian shipped systemd
[2016/02/08 13:46:15] <mt> Canonical dislikes everything
[2016/02/08 13:46:23] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/02/08 13:46:39] @ brmbrmca1 is now known as brmbrmcar

[2016/02/08 13:47:10] <ElementW> mt: Wayland's intent is to kill all the legacy that X is and bears
[2016/02/08 13:47:22] <ElementW> That includes the many dependencies on, today, Linux
[2016/02/08 13:47:37] <mt> Well, would they accept patches to make it support *BSD?
[2016/02/08 13:48:09] <ElementW> depends on who is "they"
[2016/02/08 13:48:14] <mt> Wayland
[2016/02/08 13:48:19] <ElementW> Wayland is a (non-networked) protocl
[2016/02/08 13:48:20] <ElementW> procol
[2016/02/08 13:48:23] <ElementW> no more no less
[2016/02/08 13:48:32] <mt> The team writing the reference implementation
[2016/02/08 13:48:44] <ElementW> then you're talking about the Weston guys
[2016/02/08 13:49:29] <ElementW> But if you're ready to make patches and test them for *BSD
[2016/02/08 13:49:37] <ElementW> I don't see why they'll reject them
[2016/02/08 13:50:08] <Tobbi> Guys, back to topic...
[2016/02/08 13:50:12] <mt> some freedesktop.org projects (e.g. systemd) don't seem to want *BSD support
[2016/02/08 13:50:16] <Tobbi> mt: Is there anything else for GSoC?
[2016/02/08 13:50:27] <mt> For ideas?
[2016/02/08 13:50:37] <ElementW> Was gonna say "graphics" but graphics != code
[2016/02/08 13:50:42] <Tobbi> mt: Yes.
[2016/02/08 13:50:52] <mt> I guess, as I wrote on the page, we'll let students also propose own ideas
[2016/02/08 13:50:57] <Tobbi> Sure...
[2016/02/08 13:51:08] <Tobbi> Just wondering whether there's something we want done. Also, please review my scribblings.
[2016/02/08 13:51:31] <mt> But no my-idea-is-completely-ridiculous-but-Im-the-best-gsoc-student-that-will-apply ideas
[2016/02/08 13:52:08] <Tobbi> mt: Maybe to prevent that, I should apply myself :P
[2016/02/08 13:52:24] <Tobbi> I would get money for being a student and money for being the mentoring organization.
[2016/02/08 13:52:32] <Tobbi> Also, does Google specifically not say that anywhere?
[2016/02/08 13:52:44] <Tobbi> I mean: Say that you're not allowed to do that?
[2016/02/08 13:52:56] <mt> You can't apply as student when you're organization admin or mentor
[2016/02/08 13:53:11] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2016/02/08 13:53:13] <Tobbi> damn...
[2016/02/08 13:53:19] <ElementW> That'd be too easy
[2016/02/08 13:53:25] <Tobbi> mt: But I could apply for other projects, couldn't I? :P
[2016/02/08 13:53:32] <mt> I'm not sure
[2016/02/08 13:53:35] <leper`> wasn't there something about being able to work on it as a student, but you need someone else to mentor?
[2016/02/08 13:53:36] <Tobbi> oh, okay.
[2016/02/08 13:53:36] <mt> read the /rules/

[2016/02/08 13:56:29] <ElementW> Here lies Tobbi's hopes.
[2016/02/08 13:56:35] <Tobbi> yeah, damn it.
[2016/02/08 13:56:47] <mt> "At the end of the Program, Organizations may receive (i) a $500 USD stipend per Student mentored, and (ii) subject to Sections 7.1(e)(vi) and (vii), a $2,200 USD stipend to send up to two (2) Members to the Mentor Summit, by making a request through the form provided by Google by August 22, 2016.

[2016/02/08 13:57:12] <mt> "GET TOBBI ALL THE MONEY"
[2016/02/08 13:57:12] <brmbrmcar> Why do the students get $5500 but the organisation just $500?
[2016/02/08 13:57:29] <mt> brmbrmcar: because the students do the hard work, not the organizations
[2016/02/08 13:57:31] <Tobbi> What? A mentor summit? :D
[2016/02/08 13:57:40] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/02/08 13:57:44] <Tobbi> I will totally be there.
[2016/02/08 13:57:45] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/08 13:57:45] <brmbrmcar> I guess that's alright.
[2016/02/08 13:57:48] <Tobbi> Who else?
[2016/02/08 13:58:08] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/08 13:59:41] <Tobbi> mt: Will you be joining the mentor summit with me? :D
[2016/02/08 13:59:47] <Tobbi> Or sydney_untangle
[2016/02/08 13:59:58] <Tobbi> or eeh...Karkus
[2016/02/08 14:00:05] <Tobbi> or who else? ;D
[2016/02/08 14:00:27] <Tobbi> Okay, I can now apply...
[2016/02/08 14:01:04] <mt> Just make all the people mentors and invite the to the mentor summit!!!1
[2016/02/08 14:01:12] <Tobbi> mt: Maximum is 2...
[2016/02/08 14:01:14] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/08 14:01:22] <mt> Well, only 2 receive money I think
[2016/02/08 14:02:05] <mt> The others would probably still get invited, but have to pay travel costs
[2016/02/08 14:03:12] <Tobbi> Ah, okay...
[2016/02/08 14:03:29] <Tobbi> mt: Our organization name is "SuperTux Team" or just "SuperTux"?
[2016/02/08 14:03:38] <mt> That stipend for the mentor summit is kinda useless for people who live in the SF Bay area (if Google's campus is referring to that in Mountain View, CA, US)
[2016/02/08 14:03:43] <mt> just "SuperTux"
[2016/02/08 14:03:45] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/02/08 14:05:19] <Tobbi> OKay, now...

[2016/02/08 14:07:26] <Tobbi> I put down 1-5 members...
[2016/02/08 14:07:31] <mt> Tobbi: are keywords enough or do you want us to write 1000 words of blablabla (or is that 1 characters)
[2016/02/08 14:07:33] <Tobbi> Because the other one would be 5-10 members.
[2016/02/08 14:07:39] <mt> s/1 /1000 /
[2016/02/08 14:07:39] <red_bot> mt meant: "Tobbi: are keywords enough or do you want us to write 1000 words of blablabla (or is that 1000 characters)"
[2016/02/08 14:07:44] <Tobbi> I think writing a text would be great.
[2016/02/08 14:08:09] <mt> actually, 1000 words seems a bit too much, right?
[2016/02/08 14:08:13] <Tobbi> I am not sure if I would be a good member...
[2016/02/08 14:08:18] <Tobbi> Yes, 1000 words is excessive.

[2016/02/08 14:08:36] <Tobbi> I am not sure if I would be a good mentor.
[2016/02/08 14:09:09] <Hume2> So I could be a mentor voluntarily.
[2016/02/08 14:09:16] <Tobbi> Hume2: Oh, sure you could.
[2016/02/08 14:09:41] <Tobbi> mt: It's 1000 characters :D
[2016/02/08 14:09:44] <Hume2> Is it like 1000 chars maximum or minimum?
[2016/02/08 14:09:49] <Tobbi> maximum.
[2016/02/08 14:09:54] <Hume2> At least.
[2016/02/08 14:11:00] <mt> can we have an etherpad for this?
[2016/02/08 14:11:04] <Hume2> Well, what questions should be filled truly?
[2016/02/08 14:11:42] <Tobbi> I put down:sure.
[2016/02/08 14:11:45] <Tobbi> eh, wait.

[2016/02/08 14:13:11] <Hume2> I'm not good at this.

[2016/02/09 07:43:52] <MCMic> Is there any easy way to display tux speed on screen?
[2016/02/09 07:48:06] <mt> Tux speed?
[2016/02/09 07:50:02] <MCMic> mt: yes
[2016/02/09 07:50:21] <MCMic> With some scripting or whatever.
[2016/02/09 07:50:33] <MCMic> The same way I can display fps
[2016/02/09 07:50:59] <mt> what unit would you even use for that?
[2016/02/09 07:51:07] <mt> px/s or tiles/s
[2016/02/09 07:51:53] <mt> or x*10**y px/min or tiles/min
[2016/02/09 07:51:57] <MCMic> I don’t really care, I just want to see when I’m slowed down or not
[2016/02/09 07:52:12] <MCMic> I’m only interested in x speed
[2016/02/09 07:52:33] <mt> I'm 99.999% sure it's not possible with the current scripting API
[2016/02/09 07:52:47] <mt> Shouldn't be that hard though
[2016/02/09 07:52:51] <mt> (to implement)
[2016/02/09 07:53:10] <MCMic> I’m trying to do some kind of «Tool Assisted Speedrun» (but I’m lacking the mentioned tools, I just edit a supertux demo file by hand and play it)
[2016/02/09 07:53:35] <MCMic> ok :-/
[2016/02/09 07:55:31] <mt> hm
[2016/02/09 07:55:35] <mt> so it appears
[2016/02/09 07:55:56] <mt> that if you can access Tux as 'ScriptedObject'
[2016/02/09 07:56:11] <mt> you could call get_velocity_x() (or _y())
[2016/02/09 07:58:29] <MCMic> Interesting
[2016/02/09 07:58:43] <mt> if you can't access that for the Player, I can set up a test branch on git to add that
[2016/02/09 07:58:52] <mt> seems like a copy-and-paste task
[2016/02/09 07:59:00] <MCMic> mt: I need to go, but I’ll come back :-)
[2016/02/09 07:59:21] <MCMic> Is it easy to add a script to an existing level? Or a specific game session?
[2016/02/09 07:59:59] <mt> if it works now, in a script 'Tux.get_velocity_x()' or in the console 'sector.Tux.get_velocity_x()'
[2016/02/09 08:00:17] <MCMic> ok I’ll try that
[2016/02/09 08:00:21] <MCMic> see you

[2016/02/09 08:00:38] <pentagon> mt: The operation succeeded.
[2016/02/09 08:03:46] <mt> right now I wonder
[2016/02/09 08:04:09] <mt> if it would be possible to unit test using recorded levels
[2016/02/09 08:05:10] @ Quit: lumidify: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2016/02/09 08:30:18] <mt> is it possible to use a float as string in squirrel?
[2016/02/09 08:30:22] <sydney_untangle> mt: Is'nt supertux also a FLOSS project?
[2016/02/09 08:30:33] * sydney_untangle is reading through that etherpad link...
[2016/02/09 08:31:38] <mt> ugh stallman terms for describing open source software
[2016/02/09 08:32:12] <mt> is it me, or is squirrel's classes syntax *very* similar to ES6's?
[2016/02/09 08:32:22] <sydney_untangle> mt: Ok, FOSS? ;)
[2016/02/09 08:32:34] <mt> "an open source project"
[2016/02/09 08:32:39] <mt> in the first answer
[2016/02/09 08:32:51] <mt> isn't that enough
[2016/02/09 08:32:56] * sydney_untangle is thinking...
[2016/02/09 08:33:08] <sydney_untangle> Yes, i guess it is...
[2016/02/09 08:33:46] <sydney_untangle> Cool, i did not know about Etherpad.
[2016/02/09 08:36:07] <sydney_untangle> I'm still trying to piece together my opinions about free and open source software.
[2016/02/09 08:37:17] <sydney_untangle> I agree with Stallman to an extent, but i also think he over-does it quite a bit.
[2016/02/09 08:37:37] * sydney_untangle flosses his teeth...

[2016/02/09 08:44:42] <Tobbi> Hello.
[2016/02/09 08:44:46] <Tobbi> mt: You there?
[2016/02/09 08:49:50] <Tobbi> mt: In any case, we need to decide on criteria for the students and how they should apply with us...
[2016/02/09 08:51:20] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Well, that they know how to code, thats a big one.
[2016/02/09 08:51:32] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: But people won't apply if they don't know how to code.
[2016/02/09 08:51:38] <Tobbi> It's called "Google Summer of code" afterall.
[2016/02/09 08:51:41] <sydney_untangle> Who knows. :)
[2016/02/09 08:51:44] <Tobbi> I do.
[2016/02/09 08:52:03] <sydney_untangle> nm...
[2016/02/09 08:52:23] <mt> pentagon: later tell MCMic as in the git master, Player.get_velocity_?() doesn't exist, I added it and will soon push it to a separate branch: https://urandom.eu.org/i/9YkaGO7T.png
[2016/02/09 08:52:23] <pentagon> mt: The operation succeeded.
[2016/02/09 08:52:51] <mt> I coded^Wcopy-pasta'ed that right now
[2016/02/09 08:53:44] <mt> Tobbi: have you submitted the application yet?
[2016/02/09 08:53:50] <Tobbi> mt: Not yet.
[2016/02/09 08:54:35] <Tobbi> mt: Actually, not sure if I did... I have to complete the supertux profile first before we're being considered.
[2016/02/09 08:54:41] <Tobbi> So, that's why we need the rules...
[2016/02/09 08:55:33] <Tobbi> mt: So, how do we want the students to apply?
[2016/02/09 08:57:42] <Tobbi> Send an e-mail with their skills?
[2016/02/09 08:57:46] <mt> Aren't there any rules from GSoC
[2016/02/09 08:57:53] <mt> I'd use the mailing list
[2016/02/09 08:58:03] <Tobbi> Guidance for students on how to apply to your organization. Should include any prerequisites or requirements. You may wish to include a template or tips for their proposals. May include limited Markdown.
[2016/02/09 08:58:27] <Tobbi> mt: Mailing list or supertuxteam at openmailbox
[2016/02/09 08:58:31] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/09 08:58:36] <mt> mailing list
[2016/02/09 08:58:41] <Tobbi> hmm, ok.
[2016/02/09 08:58:51] <mt> or get all the people with +o here access to supertuxteam
[2016/02/09 08:58:57] <mt> (forwarding?)
[2016/02/09 08:58:58] <Tobbi> mt: Prerequisites or requirements?
[2016/02/09 08:59:06] <Tobbi> I think sydney_untangle can do that.
[2016/02/09 08:59:13] <mt> are there any limits on that?
[2016/02/09 08:59:21] <Tobbi> on what? requirements?
[2016/02/09 08:59:23] <mt> yeah
[2016/02/09 08:59:28] <Tobbi> hmm
[2016/02/09 08:59:33] <mt> also, do applications need to be open?
[2016/02/09 08:59:43] <Tobbi> It only says Guidance for students on how to apply to your organization. Should include any prerequisites or requirements. You may wish to include a template or tips for their proposals. May include limited Markdown.
[2016/02/09 08:59:47] <Tobbi> I will check the rules.
[2016/02/09 09:01:26] <Tobbi> Oh god, the student has to submit an evaluation of the mentors as well :D
[2016/02/09 09:01:52] <mt> sydney_untangle: you might want to forward mails to that address to mteufel@urandom.eu.org
[2016/02/09 09:03:31] <Tobbi> mt: So, do I put down supertuxteam@ openmailbox and I can agree to forward all mails to admins?
[2016/02/09 09:03:53] <mt> where?
[2016/02/09 09:04:05] <mt> for the official recommendations for the place to apply, yes
[2016/02/09 09:04:13] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/02/09 09:04:18] <mt> I guess so
[2016/02/09 09:04:24] <mt> unless someone else objects
[2016/02/09 09:04:55] <Tobbi> mt: What information do we want from potential candidates?

[2016/02/09 09:46:22] <mt> ^^: opinions?
[2016/02/09 09:47:28] <Tobbi> mt: More than two people means three and above.
[2016/02/09 09:48:02] <Tobbi> serveral -> several
[2016/02/09 09:48:06] <mt> "We should totally add a project: convert everything to use trigraphs!!!!!111"
[2016/02/09 09:48:13] <mt> Tobbi: thanks, will fix
[2016/02/09 09:49:14] <Tobbi> but looks good.
[2016/02/09 09:49:27] <Tobbi> I believe it's also fairly diverse.

[2016/02/09 09:50:47] <mt> what do you think about trigraphs? :D
[2016/02/09 09:51:38] <Tobbi> Trigraphs?
[2016/02/09 09:51:42] <Tobbi> What is that?
[2016/02/09 09:52:02] <mt> int main(void){ ... } becomes int main(void)??< ... ??>
[2016/02/09 09:52:13] <Tobbi> ah :D
[2016/02/09 09:52:17] <Tobbi> Yes, fun!
[2016/02/09 09:52:17] <mt> int arr[1] = {1}; becomes int arr??(1??) = ??<1??>;
[2016/02/09 09:52:52] <Tobbi> Only thing missing now is us needing at least two org admins.
[2016/02/09 09:53:15] <mt> "I don't have enough money to buy me a new keyboard, so I'll continue using trigraphs"
[2016/02/09 09:53:38] <Tobbi> mt: I actually invited hume as org admin. Problem is you have to be 18 or older.
[2016/02/09 09:53:52] <Tobbi> A requirement he doesn't meet.
[2016/02/09 09:53:54] <mt> we should ask giby or gr_umbel
[2016/02/09 09:54:01] <Tobbi> mt: You're not 18, are you?
[2016/02/09 09:54:16] <mt> I don't want to be org admin
[2016/02/09 09:54:20] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/02/09 09:54:23] <Tobbi> mt: Why not?
[2016/02/09 09:54:29] <mt> because
[2016/02/09 09:54:45] <Tobbi> giby likely won't be around much...
[2016/02/09 09:54:57] <Tobbi> And gr.umbel...not sure if he's interested.
[2016/02/09 09:55:04] <mt> do org admins have to be around much?
[2016/02/09 09:55:08] <Tobbi> Who else is there?
[2016/02/09 09:55:14] <mt> Karkus?
[2016/02/09 09:55:17] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2016/02/09 09:55:20] <Tobbi> Not sure how old he is.
[2016/02/09 09:56:12] <Tobbi> mt: Also, giby can't be admin because he's coming from france, a country currently embargoed by the US. Every country embargoes France :P
[2016/02/09 09:56:20] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/09 09:56:59] <mt> tell him to move to Iceland again
[2016/02/09 09:57:26] <Tobbi> mt: In Iceland they have internet by penguin, which is even less reliable than that pidgin protocol.
[2016/02/09 09:57:41] <sydney_untangle> mt: Move to iceland so he can be a supertux org admin? I don't think so...
[2016/02/09 09:57:59] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Har har har.
[2016/02/09 09:58:13] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: What? Any experience with internet by penguin?
[2016/02/09 09:58:17] <sydney_untangle> I'm not old enough. :)
[2016/02/09 09:58:18] <mt> sydney_untangle: I don't think Tobbi's comment on France was meant so serious...
[2016/02/09 09:58:28] <Tobbi> Of course it wasn't.
[2016/02/09 09:58:29] <sydney_untangle> :-)
[2016/02/09 09:58:53] <mt> did you forget Hume is 116 years old, for google?
[2016/02/09 09:58:57] <Tobbi> mt: http://pastebin.com/JTZFMkjP
[2016/02/09 09:59:00] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2016/02/09 09:59:01] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2016/02/09 09:59:20] <Tobbi> Yet, he has to accept the invitation.
[2016/02/09 09:59:21] <sydney_untangle> My computer is like 70 years old in computer years. :p Does that count? :p
[2016/02/09 09:59:24] <Tobbi> I sent it to his teratux mail.
[2016/02/09 09:59:44] <mt> I'd rather use a new account
[2016/02/09 09:59:55] <Tobbi> I can cancel that.
[2016/02/09 09:59:56] <mt> because otherwise, Google will ask him to be a special guest
[2016/02/09 10:00:00] <mt> :D
[2016/02/09 10:00:11] <mt> because he's the oldest GSoC org admin :>
[2016/02/09 10:00:16] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/09 10:00:25] <sydney_untangle> heh.
[2016/02/09 10:00:54] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Ask your grandma to be an org admin for supertux?
[2016/02/09 10:01:00] <Tobbi> Just tell her she'll get candy and save the goats.
[2016/02/09 10:01:04] <mt> 15:54 -- We would like to take this moment to remind you that we accept absolutely no liability for the insanity you're about to endure.
[2016/02/09 10:01:06] <Tobbi> That will make her agree.
[2016/02/09 10:01:14] <mt> we should add this as an entry message for this channel
[2016/02/09 10:01:20] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/09 10:01:26] <Tobbi> With brmbrmcar, certainly.
[2016/02/09 10:01:32] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Her house is full of candy as it is and she doesn't like it when i bring my goats into her house. ;p
[2016/02/09 10:01:34] <Tobbi> *with brmbrmcar present.
[2016/02/09 10:01:46] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Okay, then tell her she'll get a goat and save the candy.
[2016/02/09 10:01:56] <Tobbi> She'll get a live chocolate goat.
[2016/02/09 10:02:26] <sydney_untangle> No. NO.
[2016/02/09 10:02:38] <sydney_untangle> ;)
[2016/02/09 10:02:58] <Tobbi> Okay, who else can be an org admin.
[2016/02/09 10:03:02] <Tobbi> leyyin can.
[2016/02/09 10:03:11] <Tobbi> He knows a lot about this community.
[2016/02/09 10:03:15] <Tobbi> At least he knows who to avoid.
[2016/02/09 10:03:21] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: You have automatically been OPed to be an admin. :D
[2016/02/09 10:03:35] @ Mode -o leyyin by ChanServ
[2016/02/09 10:03:37] <Tobbi> He's away.
[2016/02/09 10:03:40] <sydney_untangle> lol. ;)
[2016/02/09 10:03:40] <mt> :(
[2016/02/09 10:03:48] <Tobbi> mt: Was that you? :D
[2016/02/09 10:03:51] <mt> yeah
[2016/02/09 10:03:51] <leyyin> why?
[2016/02/09 10:03:53] <leyyin> what?
[2016/02/09 10:03:56] <Tobbi> oh, he's awake.
[2016/02/09 10:04:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: We need another person besides me who is above 18 years old.
[2016/02/09 10:04:08] * sydney_untangle is afk...
[2016/02/09 10:04:15] <Tobbi> for gsoc.
[2016/02/09 10:04:16] <leyyin> for?
[2016/02/09 10:04:24] <Tobbi> gsoc.
[2016/02/09 10:04:26] <leyyin> to do what?
[2016/02/09 10:04:34] <Tobbi> leyyin: Be an org admin. Google requirement.
[2016/02/09 10:04:44] <leyyin> and why can't you be? Tobbi
[2016/02/09 10:05:00] <Tobbi> leyyin: There need to be at least two people.
[2016/02/09 10:05:06] <Tobbi> I am already one.
[2016/02/09 10:05:09] <leyyin> and mt?
[2016/02/09 10:05:15] <mt> don't want to
[2016/02/09 10:05:18] <mt> >_>
[2016/02/09 10:05:19] <Tobbi> doesn't want to for undisclosed reasons.
[2016/02/09 10:05:19] <leyyin> why not?
[2016/02/09 10:05:28] <leyyin> maths22, ?
[2016/02/09 10:05:32] <Tobbi> not around.
[2016/02/09 10:05:41] <leyyin> I am not that involved with supertux :P
[2016/02/09 10:05:49] <mt> we should ask all the possible people via email, I already said that
[2016/02/09 10:05:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: Neither am I :P
[2016/02/09 10:06:10] <Tobbi> mt: No, we'll make it easy: If leyyin doesn't want to, we'll ask brmbrmcar.
[2016/02/09 10:06:18] <mt> maybe giby or maths22 have time
[2016/02/09 10:06:27] <leyyin> I will do it, if no one else wants to
[2016/02/09 10:06:33] <Tobbi> We can see...
[2016/02/09 10:06:47] <Tobbi> mt: Send an e-mail...and we can see...
[2016/02/09 10:06:59] <mt> leyyin wants to save the project from brmbrmcar's insanity? :D
[2016/02/09 10:07:36] <mt> I'll write one, you'll send it from the supertuxteam account?
[2016/02/09 10:07:41] <Tobbi> Okay, fine.
[2016/02/09 10:07:46] <Tobbi> To whom actually?
[2016/02/09 10:07:52] <mt> giby and maths22
[2016/02/09 10:07:52] <Tobbi> Do we have all their e-mail addresses?
[2016/02/09 10:07:55] <Tobbi> Okay, fine.
[2016/02/09 10:07:56] <mt> in git
[2016/02/09 10:08:00] <Tobbi> mt: And Karkus?
[2016/02/09 10:08:06] <Tobbi> Maybe he's above 18.
[2016/02/09 10:08:08] @ Mathnerd314 joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/09 10:08:15] <Tobbi> Actually...
[2016/02/09 10:08:28] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: Would you be willing to be a mentor for SuperTux during GSoC?
[2016/02/09 10:08:29] <mt> Karkus, will probably be here later
[2016/02/09 10:08:49] <mt> (and org admin)
[2016/02/09 10:08:53] <Tobbi> eh, yes.
[2016/02/09 10:08:59] <Tobbi> org admin was what I meant.
[2016/02/09 10:09:06] <mt> but more mentors would be good as well, I guess
[2016/02/09 10:09:21] <Mathnerd314> Tobbi: maybe. I think SuperTux is unlikely to get in though
[2016/02/09 10:09:27] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: Why?
[2016/02/09 10:11:04] <Mathnerd314> they've been scaling down the program, last year was mostly core infrastructure like GNU and research projects in NLP / machine learning
[2016/02/09 10:11:12] <Tobbi> oh...
[2016/02/09 10:11:16] <Tobbi> Anyway, doesn
[2016/02/09 10:11:18] <mt> eh
[2016/02/09 10:11:19] <Tobbi> 't hurt to try.
[2016/02/09 10:11:33] <mt> I think this year they'll accept more projects than they ever did before, math
[2016/02/09 10:11:43] <mt> s/math/Mathnerd314/
[2016/02/09 10:11:43] <red_bot> mt meant: "I think this year they'll accept more projects than they ever did before, Mathnerd314"
[2016/02/09 10:12:05] <leyyin> well it's math :D
[2016/02/09 10:12:20] <mt> "500+ open source organizations"
[2016/02/09 10:12:28] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: If you can PM me your e-mail address, I will send you an invitation.
[2016/02/09 10:12:49] <mt> I think there was around ~150-175 organizations in the years before
[2016/02/09 10:14:29] <mt> ref: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/ (wikipedia still lists the old website on google-melange)
[2016/02/09 10:18:24] <Mathnerd314> well, the 500+ might just be how many applied. but who knows
[2016/02/09 10:21:11] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: Can you please accept the e-mail?
[2016/02/09 10:21:41] <Mathnerd314> I'm filling it out, it's slow. I have to figure out which t-shirt size...
[2016/02/09 10:21:47] <Tobbi> ah...
[2016/02/09 10:23:45] <Mathnerd314> done
[2016/02/09 10:24:34] <Tobbi> Good, so we're now at 100%
[2016/02/09 10:25:18] <Tobbi> I guess that's it.
[2016/02/09 10:25:29] <Mathnerd314> well, I might edit the application a bit
[2016/02/09 10:25:59] <Tobbi> sure.
[2016/02/09 10:26:04] <Tobbi> Do whatever you want.
[2016/02/09 10:26:12] <mt> we should also have an ack from Hume2, Karkus and sydney_untangle
[2016/02/09 10:26:16] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2016/02/09 10:27:35] <Tobbi> I hope it won't be too stressful...
[2016/02/09 10:28:37] <Mathnerd314> hmm. we already have multi-player mode, the supertux-coop patch is easily resurrected
[2016/02/09 10:29:11] <Tobbi> really?
[2016/02/09 10:30:01] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: But that's not split-screen, is it?
[2016/02/09 10:30:14] <Tobbi> Maybe we should adapt that to say co-operative multiplayer.
[2016/02/09 10:30:18] <Tobbi> So, both get the same level...
[2016/02/09 10:30:23] <Tobbi> and have a splitscreen.
[2016/02/09 10:30:32] <Mathnerd314> no, it isn't split-screen. so I guess there would be some work involved
[2016/02/09 10:30:53] <mt> why split screen?
[2016/02/09 10:31:17] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/09 10:31:28] <Tobbi> mt: I don't know.
[2016/02/09 10:31:32] <Tobbi> Just thought it might be fun.
[2016/02/09 10:31:55] <mt> also, where's that patch? I remember there might have been a branch but that doesn't seem to be there anymore?
[2016/02/09 10:32:02] <Mathnerd314> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/contrib/supertux-coop.diff
[2016/02/09 10:32:05] <Tobbi> in contrib, isn't it?
[2016/02/09 10:32:42] <Mathnerd314> the split-screen is useful for if there's a faraway switch, I'd like it for some of our cutscenes too
[2016/02/09 10:33:06] <mt> ok
[2016/02/09 10:33:41] <Mathnerd314> but that patch handles the input and multiple player instances, so a student wouldn't have much to do
[2016/02/09 10:34:04] <mt> what about Wiimotes or similar input methods?
[2016/02/09 10:34:37] <brmbrmcar> Wiimotes need proprietary stuff, right?
[2016/02/09 10:35:30] <Mathnerd314> those would be handled in SDL, not in SuperTux
[2016/02/09 10:36:28] <mt> what about network multiplayer?
[2016/02/09 10:36:49] <mt> or generally, some kind of network integration
[2016/02/09 10:37:26] <mt> the add-on system (especially the currently non-existent API) would need some rework
[2016/02/09 10:38:45] <mt> RESTful API returning S-exp responses :D
[2016/02/09 10:39:04] <Mathnerd314> I guess we could turn the addon system into a Mario Maker clone
[2016/02/09 10:41:22] <mt> integration with the in-game editor?
[2016/02/09 10:44:13] <Mathnerd314> yeah, in-game editor and a backend website for level-sharing
[2016/02/09 10:44:30] <mt> could be two separate projects, I think
[2016/02/09 10:44:40] <Tobbi> mt: Oh, yeah, backend website.
[2016/02/09 10:44:42] <Tobbi> That's a good idea.
[2016/02/09 10:46:07] <mt> re coop patch: wouldn't it make sense to move that to a devel branch?
[2016/02/09 10:49:07] <Mathnerd314> yeah, but it was written back when SuperTux was using SVN (or even CVS, I'm not sure)
[2016/02/09 10:49:48] <mt> doesn't the patch tool accept all kinds of diffs?
[2016/02/09 10:52:27] <Mathnerd314> with coaxing
[2016/02/09 10:54:07] <Mathnerd314> looks like SuperTux would work with https://wiki.gnome.org/Wiican and the config in https://github.com/haxney/wiimote-mupen64, it doesn't look like it would take a summer
[2016/02/09 10:56:55] <Tobbi> bbl, gonna go for a walk.
[2016/02/09 10:58:42] <mt> well, SuperTuxKart has some nice UI for configuring a Wiimote (including pairing with it) and setting up different buttons
[2016/02/09 11:07:11] @ Quit: Tobbi: Remote host closed the connection
[2016/02/09 11:09:27] <Mathnerd314> yeah, I guess we could implement support for wiiuse
[2016/02/09 11:16:26] <Mathnerd314> amazing, there was already a SuperTux GSOC last year: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/tkachov/5707702298738688
[2016/02/09 11:17:03] <mt> Céu? what's that
[2016/02/09 11:17:20] @ mcmic joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/09 11:17:58] <Mathnerd314> oh, it ended up being pingus: https://github.com/Tkachov/ceu_pingus
[2016/02/09 11:19:03] <Mathnerd314> ceu is some kind of experimental reactive programming language
[2016/02/09 11:19:31] <mt> how is it a programming language when it's C++ code
[2016/02/09 11:19:45] <Mathnerd314> http://ceu-lang.org/

[2016/02/09 12:01:00] <mt> fwiw, I usually watch out to keep lines in the wiki at about 80 characters
[2016/02/09 12:01:08] <mt> so it displays properly on smaller terminals
[2016/02/09 12:01:24] <mt> (just like PEP8 wants it)
[2016/02/09 12:01:43] <Mathnerd314> eh, I really wish I could care, but nobody I've met uses 80-char terminals
[2016/02/09 12:02:20] <mt> well, when I want a smaller terminal window I have a 90 char wide one
[2016/02/09 12:02:26] <Mathnerd314> and it's text, any decent editor has line wrapping
[2016/02/09 12:02:34] <mt> but usually I also have my IRC client half of the screen
[2016/02/09 12:02:51] <mt> (which is in a terminal)
[2016/02/09 12:03:07] <Mathnerd314> Tobbi: about the proposals. The GSOC website has its own submission system, do you really need them to also email it?
[2016/02/09 12:03:28] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: I don't know...It's the form that asked...
[2016/02/09 12:04:22] <Mathnerd314> the form is so you can add extra instructions, like "meet with us on IRC before you submit your proposal so we can discuss it"
[2016/02/09 12:04:35] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: Sounds fun, go ahead and add it.
[2016/02/09 12:05:33] <mt> I guess it would still be nice if we had the proposals available for everyone in some way

[2016/02/09 12:51:51] <Tobbi> The web application should output lisp, anyway.
[2016/02/09 12:51:58] <Hume2> Are the admins automatically marked as mentors or they need to specify it somehow?
[2016/02/09 12:52:18] <mt> Everyone who's interested in mentoring and is a contributor, please add you as a possible mentor
[2016/02/09 12:52:35] <Tobbi> I suggest sydney_untangle as a mentor for graphics design.
[2016/02/09 12:52:38] <Mathnerd314> Hume2: I think first we need to get accepted, then we get a new interface to add/remove mentors
[2016/02/09 12:52:49] <Hume2> OK
[2016/02/09 12:53:01] <mt> Tobbi: feel free to edit it on the wiki
[2016/02/09 12:53:13] <mt> also, do we want to restrict it to a specific language?
[2016/02/09 12:53:21] <Hume2> Just a note: water physics != swimming
[2016/02/09 12:53:31] <Tobbi> mt: I was kidding. sydney isn't good at that.
[2016/02/09 12:53:43] <mt> Tobbi: that was re web app output
[2016/02/09 12:53:55] <Tobbi> ah...

[2016/02/09 12:54:04] <Tobbi> Details can be defined whenever.
[2016/02/09 12:54:22] <mt> in the end we'll get a web app written in lisp :D

[2016/02/09 12:55:40] <mt> Mathnerd314: I've got https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux.wiki.git as a separate git remote and also push it to that one
[2016/02/09 12:55:58] <mt> that way, the content will end up being displayed in the project wiki for supertux/supertux
[2016/02/09 12:56:43] <mt> it's being managed like this because we don't want random people to add random content to the wiki, but still allow people who seriously want to change something to submit a pull request
[2016/02/09 12:56:54] <Mathnerd314> ah. I'm just using the web interface, maybe there's some way to add a post-commit hook

[2016/02/09 12:59:13] <Hume2> Because it's too complitated and would reveal our rectangular hitboxes?
[2016/02/09 13:00:12] <Mathnerd314> hmm, I should mention that it requires rewriting the collision detection
[2016/02/09 13:00:14] <mt> Mathnerd314: right, you'd need some server listening on github's webhook notifications

[2016/02/09 13:14:03] <mt> I could actually make it trigger some script to run for supertux/wiki commits, but I'd rather not load the shell module

[2016/02/09 13:18:35] <Mathnerd314> I guess I would not mind so much if the wiki was smaller. but it is 90MB, insane
[2016/02/09 13:18:54] <mt> it's because grumbel imported the mediawiki history in a branch there
[2016/02/09 13:19:13] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/wiki/tree/mediawiki
[2016/02/09 13:20:50] <Mathnerd314> actually, travis-ci can do networked scripts. easy enough to add a little hook
[2016/02/09 13:23:43] <mt> you mean 'script: true' and 'after_success: run-a-shell-script-that-decrypts-some-ssh-key-and-uses-it-to-push-to-github.sh'
[2016/02/09 13:23:54] <Mathnerd314> yeah, the only problen is authentication
[2016/02/09 13:24:23] <mt> you can add a deploy key
[2016/02/09 13:24:44] <mt> and store that, encrypted with AES-256-whatever in the repo
[2016/02/09 13:24:56] <mt> and then use a secret travis variable to decrypt the key
[2016/02/09 13:25:45] <mt> however, I'm not sure if deploy keys support pushing to wikis
[2016/02/09 13:26:12] <mt> otherwise, create an account 'supertux-bot' and give it limited access to the supertux/supertux repo
[2016/02/09 13:37:03] <Mathnerd314> hmm, travis already adds a deploy key for the main repo. I wonder if I can copy it so it accesses both
[2016/02/09 13:38:42] <mt> are you sure that this deploy key might not just have been added by maths22?
[2016/02/09 13:39:04] <mt> because in a repo I manage and have Travis enabled, there's no deploy key by default
[2016/02/09 13:39:06] <Mathnerd314> oh, it's only automatically added for private repos
[2016/02/09 13:39:36] <mt> it just needs read access to the supertux/wiki repo
[2016/02/09 13:40:04] <mt> so it would be good to only add it to the supertux/supertux repo
[2016/02/09 13:40:10] <mt> where it's needed to push
[2016/02/09 13:41:16] @ Quit: mcmic: Quit: Konversation terminated!
[2016/02/09 13:41:40] <Mathnerd314> and apparently github disallows using deploy keys on multiple repos
[2016/02/09 13:41:55] <mt> ah right
[2016/02/09 13:42:13] <mt> I noticed that as well when we still had the main repo hosted on Google Code
[2016/02/09 13:42:15] <Mathnerd314> I'll generate a keypair and add it as an encrypted file to the wiki repo, that should work
[2016/02/09 13:42:19] <mt> And I had a mirroring cronjob
[2016/02/09 13:44:24] <Mathnerd314> I can't imagine that Github restricts wiki access, that would be weird
[2016/02/09 13:47:31] <mt> Want me to post some tweet about us considering to apply for GSoC? (https://twitter.com/supertux_team if you haven't seen that yet)

[2016/02/10 06:11:15] <leyyin> yes
[2016/02/10 06:11:26] <mt> Well, depends on your questions I guess
[2016/02/10 06:11:40] <leyyin> it is true that your name must be on the mailbox or otherwise the mail man will not deliver the correspondence?
[2016/02/10 06:12:07] <leyyin> you can't open a bank account because your name is not on the mail box? wth?
[2016/02/10 06:12:16] <leyyin> you have proof you live there
[2016/02/10 06:14:26] <mt> Deutsche Post apparently insists on that from what I've heard.
[2016/02/10 06:19:17] <mt> Apparently there is a law from 1871 that requires that your name must be on the mailbox
[2016/02/10 06:26:00] <leyyin> if you have a family of 10, your mailbox must have 10 names :D
[2016/02/10 06:26:06] <leyyin> where those all those names fit
[2016/02/10 06:26:24] <mt> then you write "Family $Lastname"

[2016/02/10 07:50:20] <mcmic_> https://github.com/MCMic/supertux/commits/release/0.4 started to work on supertux TAS
[2016/02/10 07:50:53] <mt> TAS?
[2016/02/10 07:51:06] <mcmic_> Tool assisted speedrun
[2016/02/10 07:52:23] <mcmic_> Basically I create a record for each level and then edit it by hand to make it perfect (as fast as possible). And I make a version with an option to play all these records as if it was playing the game, with the worldmap and all
[2016/02/10 07:53:39] <mt> can't you extend the existing --*-demo options?
[2016/02/10 07:54:46] <mcmic_> mt: Maybe, but it would be fairly more complicated. It would need to support any world map, etc…
[2016/02/10 07:55:17] <mcmic_> mt: I use the record-demo option to create the record and the play-demo to test it of course
[2016/02/10 07:58:46] <mt> why would it be more complicated to integrate it into the existing options than to implement it as new options?
[2016/02/10 07:59:10] <mcmic_> mt: It depends what you mean by integrating it with the new options
[2016/02/10 08:00:05] <mcmic_> If you mean being able to record/play demo of the whole game, it seems more complicated than just adding hardcoded menu choices in the code.

[2016/02/10 11:34:05] <Hume2> SuperTux-bot?
[2016/02/10 11:35:08] <Hume2> Actually the morphology of the word "robot" is usually desinterpreted.
[2016/02/10 11:35:26] <Hume2> "rob" is root and "ot" is suffix.
[2016/02/10 11:41:38] @ Quit: lumidify: Ping timeout: 276 seconds
[2016/02/10 11:44:36] <mt> it's common to call automated things 'bot', as in IRC bot, build bot

[2016/02/10 11:53:14] <Tobbi> Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?
[2016/02/10 11:58:08] <Hume2> Do you know that it's in terms of GitHub that the user must be human?
[2016/02/10 11:58:13] <Hume2> No offense.
[2016/02/10 11:58:54] <Hume2> Actually I don't know who wants to control that.
[2016/02/10 12:00:48] <mt> "Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted."
[2016/02/10 12:00:59] <mt> "registered *by*"
[2016/02/10 12:01:11] <mt> it means they don't want automated registrations
[2016/02/10 12:01:18] <brmbrmcar> I don't think they'd really care anyway.
[2016/02/10 12:01:22] <Hume2> Oh, I forgot.
[2016/02/10 12:01:55] <Hume2> I really can't read.
[2016/02/10 12:03:11] <mt> They even explicitly allow CI bots or similar

[2016/02/10 12:11:37] <brmbrmcar> Awesome
[2016/02/10 12:11:50] <brmbrmcar> They might come around soon.
[2016/02/10 12:12:10] <brmbrmcar> Closed-source though, undoubtably, to start.
[2016/02/10 12:12:13] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2016/02/10 12:12:21] <Hume2> That's a shame.
[2016/02/10 12:12:53] <Hume2> It could study all the laws and find the holes in it :D
[2016/02/10 12:13:09] <brmbrmcar> I guess.
[2016/02/10 12:13:40] <brmbrmcar> But it would only be availbable closed-source if it was difficult to make.
[2016/02/10 12:13:51] <brmbrmcar> LIke if it is revolutionary.

[2016/02/11 10:20:13] <mt> maths22: since you're apparently interested in mentoring the web thing, should we restrict that to any specific language(s)?
[2016/02/11 10:28:04] <maths22> I don't think so-We should allow the student to choose something they are comfortable with
[2016/02/11 10:28:42] <mt> Indeed
[2016/02/11 10:29:18] <maths22> I will think, however, if there are any suggestions we should make (i.e. Would suggest x, but feel free to suggest something else with a good explanation of why it is better)
[2016/02/11 10:30:27] <maths22> By the way, if you want to see a really good getting started/ideas/etc page, see http://brlcad.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code
[2016/02/11 10:30:49] <maths22> They have participated most years since 2008, so their process is nice and polished

[2016/02/11 12:49:20] <Tobbi> Also, language packs translations should always be preferred.

[2016/02/11 12:49:30] <Tobbi> And third, there should be different dictionaries.
[2016/02/11 12:49:52] <maths22> What do you mean different dictionaries?
[2016/02/11 12:49:58] <maths22> sydney_untangle: OK
[2016/02/11 12:50:21] <Tobbi> maths22: What I mean is: Translations for strings in worlds should be preferred over translations for generic strings in worlds...
[2016/02/11 12:50:34] <Tobbi> Actually, that's probably unnecessary...
[2016/02/11 12:51:05] <maths22> Tobbi: The same string should translate the same across the applicaiton (unless there is some funny case I can't think of)
[2016/02/11 12:51:16] <Tobbi> Hmm, probably right.
[2016/02/11 12:51:30] <Tobbi> maths22: But actually, we should check the translation files for duplicates and remove them.
[2016/02/11 12:51:35] <Tobbi> That's something that should be done.

[2016/02/11 14:19:09] <Hume2> Or doesn't it?
[2016/02/11 14:19:13] <mt> yes, it does work I tested it
[2016/02/11 14:19:26] <mt> there's a few comments missing and I'm too lazy to add those :D
[2016/02/11 14:19:35] <mt> otherwise it's ok
[2016/02/11 14:19:38] <Hume2> Then I think you can merge it.
[2016/02/11 14:20:03] <brmbrmcar> Tilemaps via scripting?
[2016/02/11 14:20:08] <Hume2> I think that get_velocity_x/y doesn't need any comment IMO.
[2016/02/11 14:20:08] <brmbrmcar> AWESOME
[2016/02/11 14:20:56] <Hume2> 48 is the brown block, I tested that on this one.
[2016/02/11 14:21:21] <mt> I'll add comments anyway, for doxygen completeness
[2016/02/11 14:21:45] <Hume2> Yeah, that could be better :D
[2016/02/11 14:22:12] <Hume2> I don't know why, but I still remember some tile IDs.

[2016/02/11 14:22:49] <mt> src/scripting/scripted_object.hpp also doesn't have comments for that
[2016/02/11 14:23:14] <Hume2> True.
[2016/02/11 14:23:28] <Hume2> How the doxygen works by the way?
[2016/02/11 14:23:56] <Hume2> I guess it scans the code and looks for comments, doesn't it?

[2016/02/12 09:20:36] <mt> 22:05:32 <+Tobbi> mt: Can you constify those get_velocity functions?
[2016/02/12 09:20:40] <mt> yay low level languages
[2016/02/12 09:20:57] <mt> should they be const so that the result can't be changed?
[2016/02/12 09:21:12] <Tobbi> mt: Well, const means they don't change the object's state.
[2016/02/12 09:21:14] <Tobbi> Which is the case.
[2016/02/12 09:21:18] <Tobbi> They just return stuff.
[2016/02/12 09:21:24] <mt> ah
[2016/02/12 09:21:24] <Tobbi> And I know, I am OCD about const correctness.
[2016/02/12 09:23:04] <Tobbi> mt: Actually, if you want, you can go through all of the scripting/ functions and check whether they are marked const.
[2016/02/12 09:23:37] <mt> so basically for all get_ functions?
[2016/02/12 09:24:51] <Tobbi> mt: Basically yes. However, I have seen getter functions which change the state of the object.
[2016/02/12 09:25:21] <Tobbi> ...in the SuperTux codebase even.

[2016/02/12 09:32:26] <pentagon> [10supertux] 07tobbi 145faeb20 More work on const correctness in trigger/ [ci skip]
[2016/02/12 09:33:57] <Tobbi> mt: Oh, also, only class methods can be const...
[2016/02/12 09:34:03] <Tobbi> If you have namespace methods, they can't be const.
[2016/02/12 09:34:09] <Tobbi> Actually, that's self-explanatory.
[2016/02/12 09:35:15] <mt> so, namespaces serve no other purpose than code readability?
[2016/02/12 09:35:59] <Tobbi> mt: I *believe* namespace methods are more general convenience methods... since they're only declared once, and are not specific to the object.
[2016/02/12 09:36:06] <Tobbi> leyyin: Correct? not correct?
[2016/02/12 09:36:41] <mt> yeah well namespaces have nothing to write into, like class methods have _this, right?
[2016/02/12 09:37:03] <Tobbi> mt: Well, I think you can declare namespace variables, if I am not mistaken?
[2016/02/12 09:37:03] <leyyin> namespaces have not other purpose than code maintainability
[2016/02/12 09:37:07] <Tobbi> Okay, good.
[2016/02/12 09:37:20] <mt> okay, so what I assumed
[2016/02/12 09:37:25] <leyyin> Tobbi::print and leyyin::print
[2016/02/12 09:37:28] <leyyin> my print is better :P
[2016/02/12 09:37:43] <Tobbi> leyyin: But, still, if I create an instance of an object it also creates an instance of all the methods, right?
[2016/02/12 09:37:57] <leyyin> huh?
[2016/02/12 09:38:08] <leyyin> instance of all the methods?
[2016/02/12 09:38:12] <leyyin> what is that
[2016/02/12 09:38:25] <Tobbi> leyyin: You know, if I say "auto i = new Tobbi();" and class Tobbi has method "print"...
[2016/02/12 09:38:58] <leyyin> you have a new object, you can call any methods of that class
[2016/02/12 09:39:06] <leyyin> I do not understand your question
[2016/02/12 09:39:33] <Tobbi> leyyin: When I instantiate a new class, it allocates memory, right?
[2016/02/12 09:39:44] <Tobbi> And it allocates memory for the method code and for all the properties...
[2016/02/12 09:39:45] <leyyin> depends if on the heap or the stack
[2016/02/12 09:39:54] <Tobbi> Hrm, right.

[2016/02/12 09:40:40] <Tobbi> leyyin: What I mean is: namespace methods are shared across the program, thus only allocated once...and methods of classes you instantiate (on the heap for example) are allocated once for each instance?
[2016/02/12 09:40:42] <Tobbi> hrm, okay.

[2016/02/13 08:32:39] <Tobbi> No problem.
[2016/02/13 08:33:08] <mt> can we trash ./configure?
[2016/02/13 08:37:09] <Hume2> Tobbi: OK, thanks for your opinion.
[2016/02/13 08:37:29] <Tobbi> Hume2: Huh? Since when are you so nice? :P
[2016/02/13 08:37:39] <Tobbi> Hume2: Remember: My opinion doesn't count anything.
[2016/02/13 08:37:57] <Hume2> I was just about to ask the others.
[2016/02/13 08:38:24] <mt> from what I can see on the added/changed files of the pull request, I have the same opinion as Tobbi
[2016/02/13 08:39:08] <Hume2> Thanks, mt.

[2016/02/13 08:40:46] <mt> I wonder why the old developer team doesn't comment on any issues :/
[2016/02/13 08:41:07] <mt> Those that are in the organization are subscribed to all the issues and pull requests
[2016/02/13 08:41:41] <Hume2> I'd say that they have no time.
[2016/02/13 08:41:50] <Hume2> That is acceptable.
[2016/02/13 08:42:05] <mt> Sure
[2016/02/13 08:42:16] <Hume2> However, it's strange that we don't have any feedback from them.
[2016/02/13 08:42:48] <Hume2> At least some: "Hello, nice job" or whatever.
[2016/02/13 08:43:34] <Hume2> It seems like they have forgotten that any SuperTux exists.
[2016/02/13 08:44:37] <Tobbi> mt: I wonder whether they really care.
[2016/02/13 08:44:49] <mt> maybe you have better things to do when you work at large tech companies or research in "Vehicular networking"
[2016/02/13 08:44:51] <Tobbi> I mean: If I participated in a game 10 years ago...
[2016/02/13 08:45:03] <Tobbi> I would probably not want to check up on that.
[2016/02/13 08:45:23] <Tobbi> I'd say we're doing a great job.
[2016/02/13 08:45:51] <mt> Tobbi: well, they didn't only "participate", they wrote a lot of the Milestone 2 codebase (which was, basically, rewritten)
[2016/02/13 08:46:04] <Tobbi> mt: But still...long time ago.
[2016/02/13 08:46:59] <Hume2> I know, but I'd then expect at least some minor feedback. This seems me like they have forgotten.
[2016/02/13 08:48:15] <Tobbi> probably...
[2016/02/13 08:49:34] <Hume2> It looks like WolfgangB hasn't forgotten, he even commited 8 times between 2013
[2016/02/13 08:49:39] <Hume2> and 2015.
[2016/02/13 08:50:16] <Hume2> I'm not even speaking about commits, I'm speaking about any feedback.
[2016/02/13 08:51:04] <Tobbi> Yup.

[2016/02/13 09:16:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: What is "Czech (Czech Republic)" in Czech?
[2016/02/13 09:17:16] <Hume2> Tobbi: Do you mean the name of the language or the name of the country?
[2016/02/13 09:17:30] <Tobbi> Hume2: The literal translation for the above string.
[2016/02/13 09:17:37] <Hume2> It depends.
[2016/02/13 09:17:45] <Tobbi> Hume2: I am working on adding name_localized to tinygettext.
[2016/02/13 09:17:58] <Hume2> So it's the name of the language.
[2016/02/13 09:18:02] <Hume2> right?
[2016/02/13 09:18:44] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yes.
[2016/02/13 09:18:50] <Hume2> Then it's: Čeština
[2016/02/13 09:18:53] <Tobbi> But the name of the country in brackets.
[2016/02/13 09:19:04] <Hume2> (Česká Republika)

[2016/02/13 11:01:42] <Tobbi> mt: I've been thinking: We should add "Improve localization system" to GSoC ideas, I think. Thing is: It'd be great if it could auto-create langpacks in defined intervals by pulling from transifex.
[2016/02/13 11:02:03] <mt> Needs infrastructure
[2016/02/13 11:02:08] <mt> (well, web thing does too)
[2016/02/13 11:02:43] <mt> could Travis pull from Transifex?
[2016/02/13 11:02:54] <Tobbi> I am not sure.
[2016/02/13 11:03:04] <Tobbi> Could be.
[2016/02/13 11:03:07] <mt> like, let's say we have a branch deploy/langpacks

[2016/02/13 11:03:19] <mt> (latest master)

[2016/02/13 11:04:08] <mt> or, for the web app project

[2016/02/13 11:04:19] <mt> 'rebuild language pack'
[2016/02/13 11:04:35] <Tobbi> mt: And then we could also have rebuild translation template.
[2016/02/13 11:04:51] <mt> feel free to add it as a separate idea; however I think that's not enough work for the students
[2016/02/13 11:05:29] <Tobbi> Hmm, probably not.
[2016/02/13 11:05:43] <Tobbi> No, it's fine. once the webapp is in place (in case it is) we can add it.

[2016/02/14 10:45:43] <Tobbi> Yeah, that's settled. I'll be a janitor.
[2016/02/14 10:45:44] <leyyin> you earn more than a programmer in Romania
[2016/02/14 10:46:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes, but everything is less expensive in Romania.
[2016/02/14 10:46:40] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, I was told we start off with 3000 gross pay as a B. Sc.
[2016/02/14 10:47:15] <Tobbi> But I'd rather go for a M. Sc. and then **** up completely :P
[2016/02/14 10:47:52] <leyyin> you earn 3000 euro per month in germany? as a beginner???
[2016/02/14 10:48:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: gross, not net.
[2016/02/14 10:48:10] <leyyin> still a lot
[2016/02/14 10:48:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: That's what I was told...
[2016/02/14 10:48:23] <Tobbi> by others who started...
[2016/02/14 10:49:13] <leyyin> I should work for western company and live in Romania
[2016/02/14 10:49:17] <leyyin> like a king :D
[2016/02/14 10:49:20] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/14 10:49:35] <leyyin> I would buy an apartment every year
[2016/02/14 10:49:44] <leyyin> and rent them
[2016/02/14 10:49:47] <leyyin> and live off the rent
[2016/02/14 10:49:50] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/14 10:50:04] <leyyin> this does not sound bad at all
[2016/02/14 10:50:17] <Tobbi> leyyin: How much do you get with a B. Sc. in Romania?
[2016/02/14 10:50:41] <leyyin> 600 euro is average I think
[2016/02/14 10:50:44] <Tobbi> What?
[2016/02/14 10:50:50] <leyyin> low, high?
[2016/02/14 10:50:53] <Tobbi> low.
[2016/02/14 10:50:57] <leyyin> as a beginner
[2016/02/14 10:51:09] <Tobbi> leyyin: People stacking shelves in the supermarket get 400 EUR / month.
[2016/02/14 10:51:13] <leyyin> some go as low as 500 euro

[2016/02/14 11:00:02] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Well, as a farm we handle nearly a half million gross, but make about $20,000 net... and the govornment wants to tax us on gross... not fun.
[2016/02/14 11:00:20] <leyyin> huh?
[2016/02/14 11:00:27] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, do you know that gross and net is?
[2016/02/14 11:00:44] <leyyin> on is after taxes and one is before taxes
[2016/02/14 11:00:47] <leyyin> *one
[2016/02/14 11:00:52] <Tobbi> gross != synonym for goat.
[2016/02/14 11:01:01] <Tobbi> although goats can be gross sometimes.
[2016/02/14 11:01:01] * sydney_untangle blinks at Tobbi...
[2016/02/14 11:01:06] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/02/14 11:01:07] <Tobbi> sorry.
[2016/02/14 11:01:22] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: to me gross is before payments and net is what we are left with...
[2016/02/14 11:01:42] <leyyin> I do not think it is that way
[2016/02/14 11:01:50] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Of course the government taxes you on gross, net is what you're left with after taxes have been deduced.
[2016/02/14 11:02:01] <sydney_untangle> \o/ well, you get my point. ;0
[2016/02/14 11:02:03] <sydney_untangle> )*
[2016/02/14 11:02:16] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, Net (or Nett) refers to the amount left over after all deductions are made. Once the net value is attained, nothing further is subtracted. The net value is not allowed to be made lower.
[2016/02/14 11:02:29] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Precisely.
[2016/02/14 11:02:53] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Your government deduces 480k from 500k?
[2016/02/14 11:03:05] <Tobbi> I don't get it.
[2016/02/14 11:03:06] <mt> sydney_untangle: the 0.5 M/20 K is per year or per month?
[2016/02/14 11:03:08] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I'm sure they would like to. ;)
[2016/02/14 11:03:19] <sydney_untangle> mt: Per year.
[2016/02/14 11:03:30] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I don't get your point... You make half a million per year and are only left with 20k ?
[2016/02/14 11:03:35] <leyyin> that kind of farmer will be a millionare here
[2016/02/14 11:03:51] <sydney_untangle> I'm just saying that people seem to think that we float on a pool of cash, when actually most of it goes back into cows and maintainance.
[2016/02/14 11:03:51] <Tobbi> But I guess not all of it is deductions...but also stuff like electricity etc.
[2016/02/14 11:03:59] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/02/14 11:04:04] <Tobbi> Okay, now I get your point.
[2016/02/14 11:04:25] <sydney_untangle> And there is *alot* of maintainance...
[2016/02/14 11:04:33] <leyyin> robots

[2016/02/14 11:04:48] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: They still are not cost efficient.
[2016/02/14 11:04:50] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, anyway, 2 people independently told me that they earn 3k gross...so it seems to be some standard for B. Sc. people.
[2016/02/14 11:05:11] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: You feed your cows with money?
[2016/02/14 11:05:13] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: They are such high maintainance, and so expensive up front that they never pay for themselves.
[2016/02/14 11:05:23] <leyyin> THE FUTURE
[2016/02/14 11:05:29] <leyyin> people are redudant

[2016/02/14 11:05:55] <leyyin> no one will do manual labour in first world countries in 200 years

[2016/02/14 11:06:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: Stop those negative outlooks... I got enough negative outlooks yesterday...
[2016/02/14 11:06:35] <leyyin> what is negative?
[2016/02/14 11:06:37] <sydney_untangle> mt: Good question.
[2016/02/14 11:06:49] <sydney_untangle> Maybe we won't be here in 200 years? ;)
[2016/02/14 11:06:52] <leyyin> america will starve without the mexicans
[2016/02/14 11:07:16] <Tobbi> leyyin: You know my father is like: "Government got money for refugees but doesn't have any money for pension increases"
[2016/02/14 11:07:47] <Tobbi> I'm so tired of hearing this. My father got enough money by himself...and I'm sick of hearing this bullshit...
[2016/02/14 11:07:59] <Tobbi> I mean: Why would you need money...?
[2016/02/14 11:08:07] <leyyin> to buy old man things
[2016/02/14 11:08:13] <leyyin> oh, your dad is on a pension
[2016/02/14 11:08:34] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes, but he works anyway...
[2016/02/14 11:08:36] <Tobbi> to have more money.
[2016/02/14 11:08:48] <leyyin> what does he want to do with it?
[2016/02/14 11:08:51] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: I cannot help it that we are raising people to live on govornment funds, and only the mexicans are willing to take the lower paying more physically demanding jobs...
[2016/02/14 11:08:56] <leyyin> If I was old I would play only games all day
[2016/02/14 11:08:57] <Tobbi> leyyin: Just "have" it.
[2016/02/14 11:09:28] <leyyin> I am a strong believer that everyone should have a home and food
[2016/02/14 11:09:30] <Tobbi> leyyin: C'mon, Germany is like: The more money you have the higher your status. Or at least some people think that's the case.
[2016/02/14 11:09:32] <leyyin> provided by the state
[2016/02/14 11:09:35] <leyyin> that is socialism
[2016/02/14 11:10:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: I do have a home and food, yet I am not happy.
[2016/02/14 11:10:05] <leyyin> works well for Europe
[2016/02/14 11:10:06] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: I'm a strong believer that if you don't work you don't eat.

[2016/02/14 11:10:25] <leyyin> help the homeless, etc
[2016/02/14 11:10:50] <leyyin> Europe still has a lot of homeless people :(
[2016/02/14 11:11:11] <leyyin> does anyone feel happy when you see someone homeless?
[2016/02/14 11:11:12] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: I am fine with helping, but them living on our help is not right.
[2016/02/14 11:11:28] <Tobbi> leyyin: Problem is: People come towards me asking me for money...and I'm not comfortable getting them some.
[2016/02/14 11:11:37] <Tobbi> Money doesn't help, they'll just buy beer and what not.
[2016/02/14 11:11:49] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Alot of time people around here who are "homeless" are not.
[2016/02/14 11:11:50] <leyyin> yeah Tobbi, but an organization from the goverment maybe cand find out his problem, etc
[2016/02/14 11:12:01] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, tell that to San Francisco
[2016/02/14 11:12:05] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: And *that* is exactly the problem we're facing: Individualism doesn't help.
[2016/02/14 11:12:20] <sydney_untangle> yay, another government program. *facepalm*.
[2016/02/14 11:12:25] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/02/14 11:12:29] <Tobbi> Okay, let's stop this.
[2016/02/14 11:12:47] <leyyin> a conservative supreme justice died
[2016/02/14 11:13:13] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Yes lets. ;) datahead7777 told me that he installed M2 on windows, but it still had the development version logo... i wonder if he doesn't have the latest version...
[2016/02/14 11:13:24] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/02/14 11:13:32] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Do you come in here just to discuss politics? ;)
[2016/02/14 11:13:37] <leyyin> yes
[2016/02/14 11:13:39] <Tobbi> leyyin: I really don't know how much money I need to live...
[2016/02/14 11:13:46] <Tobbi> I have no basis for comparison.
[2016/02/14 11:13:54] <leyyin> I love fighting with yanks
[2016/02/14 11:14:14] <Tobbi> leyyin: How much money do you spend per month, approximately?
[2016/02/14 11:14:32] <leyyin> rent 100 euro, food 100
[2016/02/14 11:14:37] <mt> do we need to banforward leyyin to ##politics because he's always talking about politics?
[2016/02/14 11:14:44] <Tobbi> No, we don't.
[2016/02/14 11:14:48] <leyyin> yes we do
[2016/02/14 11:14:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: Okay, that's cheap...
[2016/02/14 11:14:56] <leyyin> can you ban forward?
[2016/02/14 11:15:03] <leyyin> is that a thing you can do?
[2016/02/14 11:15:11] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Are you living with relatives? If not, why is your rent so cheap?
[2016/02/14 11:15:26] <sydney_untangle> $600/ month is bottom of the line here.
[2016/02/14 11:15:27] <leyyin> rent is 200, I live with a friend in a 2 bedroom apartment
[2016/02/14 11:15:34] <mt> leyyin: please have a look at https://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml to see what modes do on freenode
[2016/02/14 11:15:43] <mt> and yes, you can banforward
[2016/02/14 11:15:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: I live in a house...and I can afford it...But I don't spend money on useless things.
[2016/02/14 11:16:11] <leyyin> but now I am at my parents house
[2016/02/14 11:16:28] <leyyin> school break
[2016/02/14 11:16:43] <Tobbi> leyyin: Me, too. But we still have regular project meetings.
[2016/02/14 11:17:17] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, Eastern Europe
[2016/02/14 11:17:25] <leyyin> do you want for our rents to be higher?
[2016/02/14 11:17:43] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: No, its fine, im just rather suprised.
[2016/02/14 11:17:48] <leyyin> we earn like a quarter of what you earn
[2016/02/14 11:17:58] <leyyin> a quarter or less
[2016/02/14 11:18:08] <sydney_untangle> Inflation... ;)
[2016/02/14 11:18:37] <leyyin> it's harder for us to buy electronics, because they are soo expensive compared to our wages
[2016/02/14 11:18:50] <sydney_untangle> So i've heard.
[2016/02/14 11:19:04] <leyyin> an iphone costs 1000$ here
[2016/02/14 11:19:08] <leyyin> you got to be crazy
[2016/02/14 11:19:35] <leyyin> second hand android phone FTW
[2016/02/14 11:19:47] <leyyin> 1/4 of the price :P
[2016/02/14 11:19:47] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: And most Americans go into debt to buy christmas presents...
[2016/02/14 11:20:05] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, well they can make another credit to repay the previous credit :P
[2016/02/14 11:20:19] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Yes, iphones are alot, thats one of the reason i don't have one. ;)
[2016/02/14 11:20:56] <sydney_untangle> I also am not a supporter of apple, or the mini "jail" of an OS.
[2016/02/14 11:21:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: Americans are spending crazy...
[2016/02/14 11:21:36] * sydney_untangle worded that wrong...
[2016/02/14 11:21:44] <sydney_untangle> Sadly, yes we are...
[2016/02/14 11:21:47] <leyyin> Tobbi, and they do not save money
[2016/02/14 11:21:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yeah...
[2016/02/14 11:21:55] <leyyin> I never understood that
[2016/02/14 11:22:04] <leyyin> Europeans, save almost all their money :P
[2016/02/14 11:22:09] <sydney_untangle> I cannot say my family does, but its easy to point fingers. ;)
[2016/02/14 11:22:10] <leyyin> at least we easterns do
[2016/02/14 11:22:43] <sydney_untangle> Seems like money is tight enough without trying to borrow money...
[2016/02/14 11:22:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: I save a lot of money...not currently, though.
[2016/02/14 11:23:03] <sydney_untangle> or buying lots of new equipment or the newest farm tech, etc...
[2016/02/14 11:23:05] <Tobbi> I don't have any income currently.
[2016/02/14 11:23:14] <leyyin> me neither
[2016/02/14 11:23:21] <leyyin> oh wait, my schoolarship
[2016/02/14 11:23:27] <leyyin> which is about 100$ per month :D
[2016/02/14 11:23:30] <Tobbi> leyyin: I used to get Bafög...
[2016/02/14 11:23:32] <leyyin> pays for food
[2016/02/14 11:23:37] <Tobbi> Bundesausbildungsförderungsgesetz.
[2016/02/14 11:23:44] <leyyin> sigh
[2016/02/14 11:24:26] <leyyin> Tobbi, http://ci.memecdn.com/15/4948015.jpg
[2016/02/14 11:24:29] <Tobbi> leyyin: That's my word.
[2016/02/14 11:25:08] <sydney_untangle> sigh, thats is a very good word...
[2016/02/14 11:25:19] <sydney_untangle> We sit here tearing eachother appart. ;)
[2016/02/14 11:25:40] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, ever tasted east european food?
[2016/02/14 11:26:29] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Probably, not sure though. Not specifically.
[2016/02/14 11:26:49] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: We're not tearing each other apart.
[2016/02/14 11:27:14] <leyyin> you should taste it, most of the traditional food was invented in times of famine :D
[2016/02/14 11:27:26] <leyyin> good times
[2016/02/14 11:28:08] <leyyin> I do not know what is with food and invetions, when they get starving they invent something new
[2016/02/14 11:28:31] <leyyin> if I starve myself, maybe I will be a genius
[2016/02/14 11:28:40] <sydney_untangle> LOL, maybe...
[2016/02/14 11:28:55] <leyyin> BIG MAYBE
[2016/02/14 11:29:01] <leyyin> how is GSOC?
[2016/02/14 11:29:10] <leyyin> did you apply yet?
[2016/02/14 11:29:49] <Tobbi> <Tobbi> macrobat: I wonder whether there's a difference between nationalities when it comes to readiness for violence.
[2016/02/14 11:29:49] <Tobbi> <macrobat>Tobbi: here, it is considered racist to wonder about such things
[2016/02/14 11:30:08] <Tobbi> I'm in this channel for a few minutes only and I had my first faux-pax.
[2016/02/14 11:30:42] <Tobbi> leyyin: We did apply...and things will start once the application phase is closed.
[2016/02/14 11:30:48] <Tobbi> We might be considered.
[2016/02/14 11:32:53] <Tobbi> leyyin: But seriously: Are certain nationalities more prone to react violently than others? And I'm not asking in a racist context.
[2016/02/14 11:33:11] <Tobbi> Actually...maybe it depends on how you handled things previously.
[2016/02/14 11:33:16] <Tobbi> or how you were treated.
[2016/02/14 11:40:58] <datahead7777> sydney_untangle, it said I had 2 copies of Super Tux installed, I think.  I saw two icons.
[2016/02/14 11:43:17] <leyyin> Tobbi, of course, but it depends where they grew up
[2016/02/14 11:43:30] <Tobbi> leyyin: It depends how they grew up, right?
[2016/02/14 11:43:56] <leyyin> yes
[2016/02/14 11:44:15] <leyyin> and ISIS kid will chop your head off
[2016/02/14 11:44:26] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/02/14 11:45:03] <leyyin> if they grew in the slums with gangs
[2016/02/14 11:45:15] <leyyin> they are higher prone to react violently
[2016/02/14 11:46:19] <leyyin> if your enviromenet is violent, there is a high chance you will be too
[2016/02/14 11:46:30] <leyyin> now I am an expert in sociology? Tobbi
[2016/02/14 11:46:43] <sydney_untangle> datahead7777: You may want to try uninstalling all the versions of supertux that you have installed, then go to the supertux website and re-download the latest version.
[2016/02/14 11:47:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: probably.
[2016/02/14 12:07:27] <datahead7777> Will uninstalling wipe out my saved games?
[2016/02/14 12:09:27] <Tobbi> datahead7777: Better be save than sorry...
[2016/02/14 12:09:29] <Tobbi> *safe
[2016/02/14 12:09:36] <Tobbi> You can safe the .supertux2 folder.
[2016/02/14 12:09:39] <Tobbi> *save
[2016/02/14 12:09:40] <Tobbi> damn this.
[2016/02/14 12:10:29] <mt> Upgrading from 0.1.3 to 0.3+ will render the old savegames unusable, I think
[2016/02/14 12:10:45] <mt> At least unless you move the old savegames to the new location
[2016/02/14 12:11:09] <mt> [just so you know]
[2016/02/14 12:11:52] <mt> And usually, package managers don't remove user configuration
[2016/02/14 12:23:04] <datahead7777> So I'd need to backup the .supertux2 folder and then move over the saves games within it manually, afterwards
[2016/02/14 12:29:40] <mt> 0.1.3 doesn't use the .supertux2 folder
[2016/02/14 12:29:53] <mt> I don't know what version you're using
[2016/02/14 12:30:12] <mt> with 0.3+, it should be safe to leave the .supertux2 folder as-is

[2016/02/14 13:34:11] <Hume2> It's a couple of numbers.
[2016/02/14 13:35:15] <Hume2> It's like: I'll increment your number and youl'll give me <something>.
[2016/02/14 13:36:06] <Hume2> This seems as something unstable.
[2016/02/14 13:44:52] <Hume2> Almost all states are in debt, maybe it's that thing.

[2016/02/15 09:08:20] <leyyin> Tobbi, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11100271
[2016/02/15 09:08:40] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/15 09:08:43] <Tobbi> leyyin: Same here.
[2016/02/15 09:08:43] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/15 09:11:39] <Tobbi> leyyin: I believe, this will never happen to my Bachelor thesis...
[2016/02/15 09:14:01] <Tobbi> leyyin: Also, you cannot view your university score account, although it should've worked...
[2016/02/15 09:14:17] <Tobbi> I mean: Our uni messed up again.
[2016/02/15 09:14:22] <leyyin> "it is obvious that..." or "the reader will quickly see..."
[2016/02/15 09:14:30] <leyyin> not it's not asshole, explain it
[2016/02/15 09:14:43] <leyyin> I hate when reading papers with that language
[2016/02/15 09:15:07] <leyyin> so high pretentious
[2016/02/15 09:15:25] <Tobbi> heh.
[2016/02/15 09:16:14] <Tobbi> I wonder whether my thesis contains these terms.
[2016/02/15 09:17:25] <leyyin> my university sucks "Access Denied for consultation notes between 8-16 hours due to overloaded servers! You can only view notes provisional"
[2016/02/15 09:17:35] <leyyin> and they breach good quality software and stuff
[2016/02/15 09:17:42] <leyyin> and the website is shit
[2016/02/15 09:17:49] <leyyin> even our group projects have higher quality
[2016/02/15 09:18:02] <leyyin> *preach good quality
[2016/02/15 09:22:54] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/15 09:23:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: My uni loves changing stuff. So they never make it on time...
[2016/02/15 09:23:49] <Tobbi> Even though most of the time it's the same process over and over again...
[2016/02/15 09:26:00] <Tobbi> This term, they unified login processes.
[2016/02/15 09:26:07] <Tobbi> So, maybe that's a pseudo-excuse.
[2016/02/15 09:26:14] <Tobbi> However, they had so long to do it.
[2016/02/15 09:26:32] <leyyin> university teaches X they do Y
[2016/02/15 09:26:40] <leyyin> they do not even do what they preach
[2016/02/15 09:28:08] <Tobbi> yup.

[2016/02/15 12:08:08] <Hume2> Hello
[2016/02/15 12:11:34] <mt> hi
[2016/02/15 12:12:00] <mt> >https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/364#issuecomment-184160393
[2016/02/15 12:12:06] <mt> 'please do $thing'
[2016/02/15 12:12:18] <mt> how often have we told that guy to drop it
[2016/02/15 12:12:44] <mt> anyway, to block someone from an organization, as I have found out
[2016/02/15 12:12:54] <mt> an owner has to request the block use github's contact form
[2016/02/15 12:13:03] <mt> s/use/using/
[2016/02/15 12:13:03] <red_bot> mt meant: "an owner has to request the block using github's contact form"
[2016/02/15 12:13:17] <Hume2> ah
[2016/02/15 12:15:09] <Hume2> Anyway I could merge it then.
[2016/02/15 12:15:09] <mt> if you want to do that, you've got my ok; you might want to ask others
[2016/02/15 12:15:30] <mt> I'm not saying the Mr Rocket idea is entirely bad
[2016/02/15 12:15:34] <mt> I like it actually
[2016/02/15 12:15:41] <mt> however this guy has been so annoying
[2016/02/15 12:15:49] <Hume2> Yeah.
[2016/02/15 12:15:54] <mt> please do x, please do y
[2016/02/15 12:16:11] <mt> I still don't like the way it's not, after x and y are done
[2016/02/15 12:16:26] <mt> s/not/now/
[2016/02/15 12:16:26] <red_bot> mt meant: "I still don't like the way it's now, after x and y are done"
[2016/02/15 12:16:34] <Hume2> Anyway, the mr. rocket is in "grumbel glumbles"
[2016/02/15 12:16:44] <mt> link?
[2016/02/15 12:17:14] <Hume2> And yeah, please do x IS annoying.
[2016/02/15 12:17:32] <Hume2> http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Grumbel_grumbles
[2016/02/15 12:17:52] <Hume2> citation: Rockets being sqished? Never heard of that.
[2016/02/15 12:18:29] <mt> actually a really good quote :D
[2016/02/15 12:19:04] <Hume2> Some things are obsolette, but many things still aren't.
[2016/02/15 12:19:47] <Hume2> And this is really weird: http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/File:Howtonotdesignlevels.jpg
[2016/02/15 12:20:12] <mt> why is it weird?
[2016/02/15 12:20:46] <Hume2> I figured out that it is really possible to get hurt from the spike on the top.
[2016/02/15 12:21:23] <Hume2> However, a sane player wouldn't.
[2016/02/15 12:21:45] <mt> "i am saying that this scheme needs to provide proper guidance to clients to make them properly implement this functionality without getting someone killed" <--- I like this discussion on some IRC channel
[2016/02/15 12:22:08] <mt> Hume2: also depends on the value of g in the level
[2016/02/15 12:22:28] <Hume2> Yes, I suppose it's normal gravity. = 10
[2016/02/15 12:22:54] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/15 12:23:02] <mt> is Tux's size actually affecting behavior?
[2016/02/15 12:23:16] <Hume2> He's higher then.
[2016/02/15 12:23:35] <Hume2> However the jump and run velocity is the same.
[2016/02/15 12:24:13] <Hume2> Yes and he can make butt-jump.
[2016/02/15 12:25:18] <mt> I mean that related to gravity
[2016/02/15 12:25:41] <mt> oh well, it doesn't really make any difference
[2016/02/15 12:25:43] <Hume2> The tux's height doesn't change gravity.
[2016/02/15 12:28:37] <Hume2> I just realized that I have tendency to make too hard levels.
[2016/02/15 12:28:53] <Hume2> Narre was unable to pass them through.
[2016/02/15 12:29:40] <mt> "i've lost all future interest in [...] because it's filled with people who are so security clueless they will get someone killed" :D this is actually a discussion about the IRC protocol
[2016/02/15 12:30:04] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/15 12:30:42] <Hume2> At least we don't have suggestions like:
[2016/02/15 12:30:45] <mt> they're talking about activists (and similar people) getting killed
[2016/02/15 12:30:56] <Hume2> The same as <existing thing here>, but bigger
[2016/02/15 12:31:08] <mt> that would be
[2016/02/15 12:31:13] <mt> horrible suggestion
[2016/02/15 12:31:16] <mt> D:
[2016/02/15 12:31:20] <Hume2> or: The same as <existing thing here>, but another color
[2016/02/15 12:31:49] <Hume2> Yeah, I hate those copypastas.
[2016/02/15 12:32:19] <Hume2> The "The same as <existing thing here>, but bigger" is usually a boss suggestion.
[2016/02/15 12:33:10] <mt> Hume2: s/bigger/<positive adjective>/
[2016/02/15 12:33:18] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/15 12:34:01] <Hume2> And also those super modern things as suggestions :P
[2016/02/15 12:34:15] <Hume2> Add cars to SuperTux! :D
[2016/02/15 12:34:33] <mt> one thing I don't really understand: early days of mobile phones: too big. make them smaller. early smartphone era: yay phones are smaller. now: our smartphones are still way too small
[2016/02/15 12:34:48] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/15 12:35:29] <mt> like, why would I want a 7 inch phone
[2016/02/15 12:35:52] <Hume2> Because it's cool? :D
[2016/02/15 12:36:57] <Hume2> Well, I have smaller, but not the smart stuff.
[2016/02/15 12:37:02] <Hume2> :P
[2016/02/15 12:37:10] <mt> Hume2: re leafshot
[2016/02/15 12:37:22] <mt> why is the directory/file with the sprite called leaf_shot
[2016/02/15 12:37:28] <mt> and in the code it's leafshot
[2016/02/15 12:37:48] <Hume2> Well....
[2016/02/15 12:38:11] <Hume2> I dunno.
[2016/02/15 12:38:35] <mt> consistency is important
[2016/02/15 12:38:35] <Hume2> I should change it.
[2016/02/15 12:39:56] <Hume2> citation: Animation? None found. SuperTux, the game as a whole, not just the sprite, looks horrible, all static, with no fun animations around, boring.
[2016/02/15 12:40:15] <Hume2> Don't you know what is meant by the animation there?
[2016/02/15 12:40:32] <Hume2> Maybe the cutscenes, isn't it?
[2016/02/15 12:40:46] <mt> from grumbel grumbles?
[2016/02/15 12:40:54] <mt> ask grumbel when he's here
[2016/02/15 12:41:27] <Hume2> I'll ask him.
[2016/02/15 12:43:58] <Hume2> Penguins are tetrachromatic, so why do we have trichromatic lighting?
[2016/02/15 12:45:09] <mt> :D
[2016/02/15 12:45:46] <mt> CMYK colors?!
[2016/02/15 12:46:05] <Hume2> No, red, green, blue and ultra-violet
[2016/02/15 12:46:30] <mt> We'd have to ask display producers first
[2016/02/15 12:46:37] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/15 12:46:53] <mt> "Excuse me, but we'd like you to implement ultra-violet lighting in your displays"
[2016/02/15 12:47:04] <Hume2> Hum(e)ans see that kind of ultra-violet as violet.
[2016/02/15 12:47:16] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/15 12:47:27] <mt> "It totally is very healthy!!!1"
[2016/02/15 12:47:52] <Hume2> It's only 900THz, nothing dangerous.
[2016/02/15 12:48:06] <mt> "And you'll get 50% of the profit of our game!!!!11" (wouldn't even be a lie, 0.5*0 = 0)
[2016/02/15 12:48:06] <Hume2> Or something like that.
[2016/02/15 12:48:23] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/15 12:49:45] <mt> I mean, I might get ultra-violet ink and paper optimized for that kind of ink, but displays are a bit harder
[2016/02/15 12:50:00] <Hume2> That was from a very secret resource: Hume2 grumbles.
[2016/02/15 12:50:38] <Hume2> You eat a flower and a hat appears on your head. That makes very sense.
[2016/02/15 12:51:04] <mt> (re ink: I know people in the publishing and printing industry)
[2016/02/15 12:51:19] <Hume2> hmmm...
[2016/02/15 12:52:06] <Hume2> Don't worry, the majority of Hume2 grumbles is not meant seriously.
[2016/02/15 12:52:15] <mt> :D
[2016/02/15 12:52:35] <Hume2> I mean everyhing except the rule for suggesting worlds.
[2016/02/15 12:52:35] <mt> Hume2 hue2ms
[2016/02/15 12:52:41] <Hume2> :D

[2016/02/15 13:52:09] <mt> Hume2: "The IDs of worldmap tiles are messed up properly." what? messed up properly :D
[2016/02/15 13:52:30] <mt> anyway, hi!
[2016/02/15 13:52:40] <Hume2> mt: You know, these IDs, are messed up.
[2016/02/15 13:52:49] <Hume2> There are many ignored tile IDs.
[2016/02/15 13:52:55] <mt> ikr
[2016/02/15 13:53:06] <mt> but, that's not done properly then
[2016/02/15 13:53:10] <Hume2> However, I'm going to fill those gaps :P
[2016/02/15 13:53:37] <mt> who is "Jára Cimrman"
[2016/02/15 13:56:06] <Hume2> It was the world best philosopher, writer, teacher and skier.
[2016/02/15 13:56:33] <Hume2> We can negotitate about it, we can disagree, but that's the only thing we can do with it.
[2016/02/15 13:57:16] <Tobbi> Isn't that the guy who invented the holographic doctor on Voyager?
[2016/02/15 13:57:25] <Tobbi> Oh no, his first name's Louis.

[2016/02/15 13:58:38] <Tobbi> Hume2: The Doctor's PE lessons?
[2016/02/15 13:58:54] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/15 13:58:54] <Hume2> Yes, he was the PE teacher too.
[2016/02/15 13:59:40] <Hume2> "Where can you find polished poles outside? Climb real trees!"
[2016/02/15 14:01:36] <Hume2> He also predicted the discovery of telephones, so he learnt the students to use them.
[2016/02/15 14:03:51] <Tobbi> Hume2: What episode is this in?
[2016/02/15 14:04:22] <Hume2> I don't remember, it was the episode about his teaching.
[2016/02/15 14:04:35] <Tobbi> ok...
[2016/02/15 14:04:55] <Tobbi> Hume2: Are we talking about the same thing? Star Trek Voyager?
[2016/02/15 14:05:06] <Hume2> No, we aren't.
[2016/02/15 14:05:15] <Hume2> I'm talking about Jára Cimrman.
[2016/02/15 14:05:42] <Hume2> It's the cimrmanology.
[2016/02/15 14:06:44] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2016/02/15 14:06:46] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/02/15 14:07:32] <Hume2> Maybe you could try some Cimrman's sports. :)
[2016/02/15 14:08:09] <Tobbi> Hume2: I do Karate.
[2016/02/15 14:08:16] <Tobbi> That's enough IMO
[2016/02/15 14:08:43] <Hume2> Yes, altrough it's not cimrmanish :D
[2016/02/15 14:10:18] <Hume2> I do running with luggage.
[2016/02/15 14:10:56] <Hume2> Well, sometimes, only when it's useful at the moment.
[2016/02/15 14:10:58] <mt> >Jára Cimrman won the voting for The Greatest Czech in 2005 (only the fact that Cimrman is fictional prevented him from actually winning)
[2016/02/15 14:10:59] <mt> lol
[2016/02/15 14:11:14] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/15 14:11:22] <mt> also "Cimrman" somehow sounds very similar to the German word "Zimmermann"
[2016/02/15 14:11:29] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/15 14:16:44] <Tobbi> So, Cimrman is like the Czech Jakob Maria Mierscheid
[2016/02/15 14:18:37] <Hume2> Maybe, I didn't know him. Cimrman lived in the secound half of the 19th century and on the beginning of the 20th.
[2016/02/15 14:20:05] <Tobbi> Hume2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Maria_Mierscheid
[2016/02/15 14:20:17] <Hume2> I'm just there.
[2016/02/15 14:25:30] <Tobbi> ah okay.
[2016/02/15 14:31:37] <Hume2> I'm not sure. Cimrman did many things, not just stuff arround politics.
[2016/02/15 14:32:03] <Hume2> They are similar in a way though.

[2016/02/17 07:49:22] <Tobbi> How comes I am not affected by these netsplits?
[2016/02/17 07:49:35] <gynter> you are
[2016/02/17 07:50:11] <gynter> other users see you splitting :)
[2016/02/17 07:50:20] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2016/02/17 07:51:05] <gynter> netsplit occurs when node drops from the network
[2016/02/17 07:51:49] <Tobbi> gynter: I see... According to the notice, they're apparently restarting the servers due to upgrade day.
[2016/02/17 07:51:55] <Tobbi> So I should be disconnecting, shouldn't I?
[2016/02/17 07:52:48] <gynter> if they restart the server node to which you are connected then yes
[2016/02/17 07:52:54] <gynter> irc network consists of multiple server nodes
[2016/02/17 07:53:04] <gynter> basically like high availibility thing
[2016/02/17 07:53:14] <Tobbi> Yup, I got that.
[2016/02/17 07:53:48] <Tobbi> They probably scheduled the update to cameron later that day.
[2016/02/17 07:53:56] <gynter> basically it consists of nodes (servers) and hubs (a set of nodes connected together)
[2016/02/17 07:54:06] <gynter> if a hub drops then it's kind of bad netsplit :P
[2016/02/17 07:54:24] <Tobbi> According to MOTD, I'm on Cameron...
[2016/02/17 07:54:28] <Tobbi> So, yeah, let's wait for that.

[2016/02/17 09:50:23] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: No you never netsplit.
[2016/02/17 09:50:29] <Tobbi> Good thing.
[2016/02/17 09:50:33] <Tobbi> Might make it happen again.
[2016/02/17 10:02:59] <mt> if you're wondering why the netsplits happened: glibc upgrade day (don't forget to do that, if you haven't done yet)
[2016/02/17 10:07:28] <sydney_untangle> mt: Already done.
[2016/02/17 10:08:37] <Tobbi> I don't know anything about glibc.
[2016/02/17 10:10:03] <mt> It's GNU's C standard library :>
[2016/02/17 10:10:16] <Tobbi> mt: That much I do know.
[2016/02/17 10:10:22] <mt> I'd hope you know what a C standard library is
[2016/02/17 10:10:56] <Tobbi> mt: Yeah, it comes right after the A and B standard libs.
[2016/02/17 10:11:19] <mt> so basically it's a pretty normal C standard library, but with all of Stallman's insecure and sillyly licensed code
[2016/02/17 10:14:03] <Tobbi> I'm downloading libreoffice core...
[2016/02/17 10:14:04] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/17 10:14:10] <Tobbi> Quite an extensive package.
[2016/02/17 10:15:48] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Yes is it quite extensive.
[2016/02/17 10:15:58] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Ever downloaded it?
[2016/02/17 10:16:09] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I use it on a day to day basis.
[2016/02/17 10:16:19] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I am talking about the source code.
[2016/02/17 10:16:29] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Not the source.
[2016/02/17 10:16:37] <Tobbi> The source is around 2 GB.
[2016/02/17 10:16:43] <sydney_untangle> THe main package is quite large as well.
[2016/02/17 10:16:52] <Tobbi> That I don't care about.
[2016/02/17 10:16:57] <Tobbi> I want to probably submit a patch.
[2016/02/17 10:18:27] <Tobbi> hah, damn.
[2016/02/17 10:18:35] <Tobbi> Only 264 MB available.
[2016/02/17 10:18:35] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/17 10:18:44] <Tobbi> Okay, I guess I'll use another VM for that.
[2016/02/17 10:18:46] <sydney_untangle> Error performing TLS handshake: An unexpected TLS packet was received.
[2016/02/17 10:18:48] <sydney_untangle> Yay...
[2016/02/17 10:19:00] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: :)
[2016/02/17 10:19:14] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Be glad you aren't downloading 2gb on my speed. ;)
[2016/02/17 10:19:29] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Your speed is greater than with this pidgin protocol thingy.
[2016/02/17 10:19:33] <Tobbi> IP over Avian Carriers.
[2016/02/17 10:20:28] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: har har har/
[2016/02/17 10:21:07] <sydney_untangle> .
[2016/02/17 10:22:48] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Actually pidgins are faster, since they can carry drives with the data.
[2016/02/17 10:23:04] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Depends on the capacity of the drive.
[2016/02/17 10:23:41] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: true...
[2016/02/17 10:23:58] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: You'd better start training your pidgin to fly accross the ocean. ;p
[2016/02/17 10:24:09] <Tobbi> I don't own a pidgin.
[2016/02/17 10:24:13] <Tobbi> You train your goat.
[2016/02/17 10:24:15] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/17 10:24:23] <sydney_untangle> I've got some wild pidgins in our barn i can give you. They poop everywhere. :p
[2016/02/17 10:24:31] <Tobbi> Uhm, no thanks.
[2016/02/17 10:29:09] <mt> would have to be a drive with a very big capacity to be actually faster than the internet
[2016/02/17 10:29:53] <mt> undersea cables usually are multiple Tbit/s
[2016/02/17 10:30:02] <Tobbi> mt: He was talking about his internet.
[2016/02/17 10:30:31] <Tobbi> Also, only TBit/s? I thought, we'd be at PBit/s by now.
[2016/02/17 10:31:13] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Who knows...
[2016/02/17 10:31:27] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: mt does, he knows everything.
[2016/02/17 10:31:37] * sydney_untangle ...
[2016/02/17 10:32:03] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: What my siblings have tested so far of M2 seems good, no bugs yet. :)
[2016/02/17 10:32:19] <sydney_untangle> And they have played a ton of supertux recently.
[2016/02/17 10:32:30] <mt> we have many bugs in 0.4
[2016/02/17 10:32:37] <mt> we need to release 0.4.1
[2016/02/17 10:32:44] <mt> esp. the windows bugs
[2016/02/17 10:33:14] <mt> oh, now would be the time to revise our GSoC data
[2016/02/17 10:33:18] <sydney_untangle> Well, maybe on windows, im just not seeing many on linux.
[2016/02/17 10:33:37] <mt> Tobbi: can you post a screenshot with the current application content?
[2016/02/17 10:33:49] <Tobbi> mt: Application content?
[2016/02/17 10:34:12] <Tobbi> of SuperTux?
[2016/02/17 10:34:14] <Tobbi> Also, what for?
[2016/02/17 10:34:19] <mt> well, GSoC
[2016/02/17 10:34:26] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2016/02/17 10:34:37] <mt> Someone might have changed things
[2016/02/17 10:35:11] <mt> And better we suggest changes now instead of very-last-minute on Friday
[2016/02/17 10:35:37] <Tobbi> Ah, you weren't talking about the SuperTux application, but the GSoC application. :D
[2016/02/17 10:35:59] <mt> >_>
[2016/02/17 10:36:00] <mt> yeah

[2016/02/17 10:41:09] <Tobbi> So, that|s it.
[2016/02/17 10:42:11] <mt> might want to add something about the web thing to tags
[2016/02/17 10:42:26] <mt> (proposal tags)
[2016/02/17 10:42:49] <Tobbi> mt: Yeah, though no idea.
[2016/02/17 10:43:11] <mt> "web application" oslt
[2016/02/17 10:43:54] <Tobbi> mt: Only max 5 technology tags are allowed.
[2016/02/17 10:43:58] <mt> or "online integration"
[2016/02/17 10:44:04] <mt> *proposal* tags
[2016/02/17 10:44:11] <Tobbi> Or did you mean topic tags?
[2016/02/17 10:44:46] <Tobbi> I can swap some of those topics.
[2016/02/17 10:46:16] <mt> http://screencast.com/t/9NwO3XOIA at the bottom
[2016/02/17 10:46:40] <Tobbi> ah.
[2016/02/17 10:46:42] <Tobbi> yup.
[2016/02/17 10:47:25] <Tobbi> I added both online integration and web application...
[2016/02/17 10:47:52] <mt> "web application" might be too general
[2016/02/17 10:48:09] <Tobbi> Ok.
[2016/02/17 10:48:15] <Tobbi> Then only online integration.
[2016/02/17 10:48:52] <Tobbi> mt: Do we create a page on G+?
[2016/02/17 10:49:12] <mt> no
[2016/02/17 10:49:28] <Tobbi> mt: Was just thinking that it might improve our chances...
[2016/02/17 10:49:33] <Tobbi> Since it's Google.
[2016/02/17 10:49:47] <mt> Don't think that makes a big difference
[2016/02/17 10:50:46] <Tobbi> ok

[2016/02/17 11:27:39] <brmbrmcar> I did it ages ago...
[2016/02/17 11:27:51] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: If you want, you can do more than this and we can create a worldmap.
[2016/02/17 11:28:05] <sydney_untangle> brmbrmcar: You couldn't have done it ages ago, you are barely ages old. ;p

[2016/02/17 13:14:55] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: phew. I don't know. Check the docs.
[2016/02/17 13:14:58] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: fade(<new_alpha>,<time>)
[2016/02/17 13:16:46] <brmbrmcar> What alpha is non-solid?
[2016/02/17 13:16:53] <brmbrmcar> It has todo both.
[2016/02/17 13:16:53] <Hume2> 0
[2016/02/17 13:16:55] <brmbrmcar> ok

[2016/02/17 13:17:54] <Hume2> In the development versions you can modify even the coulour of the tilemap.
[2016/02/17 13:18:16] <brmbrmcar> Thanks!
[2016/02/17 13:18:38] <Hume2> It's in the Tilemap Disco Test, I don't remember it.
[2016/02/17 13:18:55] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/17 13:19:13] <Tobbi> Hume2: You shouldn't have told him. It's dangerous knowledge in the hands of brmbrmcar.
[2016/02/17 13:19:49] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/17 13:20:21] <Hume2> Tobbi: What could happen? Disco levels?
[2016/02/17 13:20:46] <Tobbi> Hume2: Don't ask me, ask him... :D
[2016/02/17 13:23:30] <Hume2> My best time in the level "Owls' revenge" is 9.20s.
[2016/02/17 13:23:56] <Hume2> Narre's best time is 9.21s :P
[2016/02/17 13:24:35] <Tobbi> mt: Should we add a "highscore server" idea to GSoC projects_
[2016/02/17 13:24:36] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/17 13:24:48] <Tobbi> We could share highscores on a server for others to beat.
[2016/02/17 13:25:01] <Hume2> Heckers welcome!
[2016/02/17 13:25:04] <mt> needs some algo to calculate the plausibility of a highscore
[2016/02/17 13:25:10] <Tobbi> Oh, right.
[2016/02/17 13:25:22] <Tobbi> mt: But that would be a fun project, wouldn't it?
[2016/02/17 13:25:41] <mt> yes
[2016/02/17 13:26:00] <Tobbi> So, let's add it :)
[2016/02/17 13:26:11] <leyyin> I will be first place anyway :P
[2016/02/17 13:26:21] <Hume2> The detector of level finishability :)
[2016/02/17 13:26:36] <leyyin> Tobbi, did you ever try http://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/ ?
[2016/02/17 13:26:43] <leyyin> I heard it is quite good
[2016/02/17 13:26:54] <Tobbi> oh.
[2016/02/17 13:27:00] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, I didn't.
[2016/02/17 13:27:13] <Tobbi> leyyin: Does it look like I want to spend money on something like this?
[2016/02/17 13:27:40] <leyyin> has a free trial
[2016/02/17 13:27:43] <mt> the problem is always: even if we use an algorithm to detect if it's faked data, others can just look at the source code to see how to make it look like real data
[2016/02/17 13:27:49] <leyyin> and cough, the sea mates
[2016/02/17 13:28:22] <mt> even a replay/demo recording could be faked
[2016/02/17 13:28:23] <Hume2> Free trial, like trial for free, all lawyers included? :D
[2016/02/17 13:28:47] <Tobbi> mt: Can't we create a hash based on current time?
[2016/02/17 13:28:54] <Tobbi> And stuff like that...to make it hard?
[2016/02/17 13:29:01] <leyyin> Tobbi, not hard for me :P
[2016/02/17 13:29:07] <Tobbi> leyyin: stfu.
[2016/02/17 13:29:12] <leyyin> security by obfuscation is not security
[2016/02/17 13:29:25] <Tobbi> leyyin: Other suggestions then?
[2016/02/17 13:29:34] <leyyin> Tobbi, someone told me "stfu" just 2 minutes ago :D
[2016/02/17 13:29:37] <leyyin> I am soo liked
[2016/02/17 13:29:43] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/17 13:29:44] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/02/17 13:30:28] <Hume2> Maybe if it sent a demo to the server, it could work.
[2016/02/17 13:30:46] <Hume2> Then the server would try the demo and look whether it works.
[2016/02/17 13:32:28] <Hume2> OK, so if a studant had enough nerves to do that…
[2016/02/17 13:32:39] <Hume2> *student
[2016/02/17 13:32:50] <Tobbi> We could also clear the stats after each month.
[2016/02/17 13:32:59] <Hume2> +1
[2016/02/17 13:33:04] <Tobbi> Because it just gets boring when you don't have a chance to beat the highscore.
[2016/02/17 13:33:12] <Hume2> Yeah.
[2016/02/17 13:33:28] <Tobbi> mt, leyyin: ^^ ?
[2016/02/17 13:33:40] <Hume2> Try to beat 9.20s in Owls' revenge. :P
[2016/02/17 13:34:31] <leyyin> clear the highscores every month?
[2016/02/17 13:34:44] <leyyin> nope, just display this month high score or all time high scores
[2016/02/17 13:34:49] <Tobbi> leyyin: Okay, fine.
[2016/02/17 13:34:57] <Tobbi> Why not, sounds like a good idea.
[2016/02/17 13:35:11] <leyyin> and give a probability for each map how fast and how many points you can get
[2016/02/17 13:35:13] <Tobbi> We could have a combined add-on / highscore website.
[2016/02/17 13:35:21] <Tobbi> yup.
[2016/02/17 13:35:27] <leyyin> so that they do not go over that limit
[2016/02/17 13:35:30] <Hume2> And what if the demo was too long? Is there any danger?
[2016/02/17 13:36:00] <Tobbi> leyyin: We could, technically, upload a file that contains the movements...
[2016/02/17 13:36:07] <Tobbi> eeh, I meant: Hume2
[2016/02/17 13:36:30] <Hume2> The calculation would be too hard I guess.
[2016/02/17 13:36:31] <mt> well, isn't that what the demo recording does?
[2016/02/17 13:36:51] <mt> to prevent spamming the server, ratelimiting and limiting upload size is always good
[2016/02/17 13:36:53] <Tobbi> mt: Exactly..
[2016/02/17 13:37:01] <Hume2> Tobbi: Also the hacker could take the highscore and try similar times.
[2016/02/17 13:37:15] <mt> that algorithm shouldn't be too hard
[2016/02/17 13:37:26] <mt> (to write)
[2016/02/17 13:37:38] <Tobbi> And I think it would make everything more fun.
[2016/02/17 13:37:46] <Tobbi> When you play against the world :)
[2016/02/17 13:37:54] <Hume2> Yeah, like limit the demot to 10 minutes or so.
[2016/02/17 13:37:56] <mt> basically some simple sanity checks, checking velocities, maybe some hidden checkpoint lines in the levels
[2016/02/17 13:38:15] <mt> Hume2: it's not about time; it's about file size
[2016/02/17 13:38:35] <Hume2> You're right.
[2016/02/17 13:38:45] <mt> and ratelimiting
[2016/02/17 13:38:56] <leyyin> Hume2, do you like hummus?
[2016/02/17 13:39:02] <mt> anonymous uploads shouldn't be allowed, tbh
[2016/02/17 13:39:11] <Hume2> leyyin: No, I don't.
[2016/02/17 13:39:20] <Hume2> It's the class enemy.
[2016/02/17 13:39:34] <Hume2> Or shall I say classroom enemy?
[2016/02/17 13:42:44] <Hume2> OK, on topic.
[2016/02/17 13:43:04] <Hume2> I didn't want to kill it with that.
[2016/02/17 13:43:32] <Tobbi> So, we could actually sanity-check the movements...
[2016/02/17 13:43:34] <Tobbi> That would work.
[2016/02/17 13:43:55] <Tobbi> Oh, problem is that recordings only work before changing spawnpoint.
[2016/02/17 13:44:15] <Tobbi> longstanding bug.
[2016/02/17 13:44:30] <Hume2> I still can't get how the sanity checks could be provided.
[2016/02/17 13:44:51] <Hume2> Like how to calculate the best possible time.
[2016/02/17 13:45:19] <Tobbi> Hume2: We could have a reference of one of our players and then reduce it by a certain percentage.
[2016/02/17 13:45:24] <Tobbi> I mean: By one of the team.
[2016/02/17 13:45:24] <Hume2> Actually, that will have to figure out the student :P
[2016/02/17 13:45:31] <Tobbi> No, that's not good.
[2016/02/17 13:45:36] <Tobbi> Isn't it?
[2016/02/17 13:45:49] <Hume2> I'm not sure.
[2016/02/17 13:46:14] <Hume2> What if someone really managed to do the highscore?
[2016/02/17 13:46:52] <Hume2> And still, the hacker could take the actual highscore and reduce it a bit.
[2016/02/17 13:47:44] <Tobbi> Hume2: No, he couldn't. We'd double-check that.
[2016/02/17 13:48:07] <Hume2> Like we'll try to get that record too?
[2016/02/17 13:48:23] <Hume2> s/record/highscore/
[2016/02/17 13:48:23] <red_bot> Hume2 meant: "Like we'll try to get that highscore too?"
[2016/02/17 13:48:46] <brmbrmcar> You won't believe how awfulthis is https://paste.kde.org/pbacldbvv
[2016/02/17 13:48:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: We could run the provided file server-side and check whether it results in the provided highscore.
[2016/02/17 13:49:06] <Tobbi> leyyin: The code sanity check thingy won't run under wine.
[2016/02/17 13:49:58] <leyyin> use champagne
[2016/02/17 13:50:43] <Tobbi> leyyin: I googled, wondering whether it might be a fork of wine. Don't do this to me.
[2016/02/17 13:50:53] <leyyin> :D
[2016/02/17 13:51:02] <leyyin> Tobbi, did you see deadpool?
[2016/02/17 13:51:10] <Tobbi> I'm setting up ZNC on my rbpi.
[2016/02/17 13:51:14] <Tobbi> And no, I don't know deadpool.
[2016/02/17 13:51:16] <Tobbi> What is it
[2016/02/17 13:51:18] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/17 13:51:21] <leyyin> GO AND SEE IT
[2016/02/17 13:51:24] <leyyin> RIGHT NOW
[2016/02/17 13:51:46] <Tobbi> leyyin: Not running right now. Runs in 30 minutes.
[2016/02/17 13:52:14] <Tobbi> Plus, I am actually configuring ZNC.
[2016/02/17 13:52:15] <Tobbi> So...
[2016/02/17 13:52:27] <leyyin> rasberry pi :P
[2016/02/17 13:52:28] <leyyin> sigh
[2016/02/17 13:52:49] <Tobbi> leyyin: If you say sigh once more, I will kick you. This is my word.
[2016/02/17 13:52:53] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/17 13:53:09] <leyyin> you are bluffing
[2016/02/17 13:53:12] <leyyin> sigh
[2016/02/17 13:53:48] <leyyin> COME ON
[2016/02/17 13:55:38] <Tobbi>  /kick leyyin you said sigh
[2016/02/17 13:55:51] <Tobbi> Also, I am eating lettuce right now.
[2016/02/17 13:56:03] <leyyin> are you a goat Tobbi ?
[2016/02/17 13:56:14] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, sydney_untangle doesn't own me.
[2016/02/17 13:56:28] <Tobbi> leyyin: I like to pretend I am actually eating healthy stuff once in a while.
[2016/02/17 13:57:12] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I can't finish your level.
[2016/02/17 13:58:12] <Tobbi> leyyin: If you'd said rabbit, I would've agreed with you, probably.
[2016/02/17 13:58:14] <Tobbi> Or maybe not.
[2016/02/17 13:58:26] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: No surprise.
[2016/02/17 13:58:35] <brmbrmcar> It may bev impossible.

[2016/02/17 13:59:30] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Do you know that the levels should be finishable? :P
[2016/02/17 13:59:37] <brmbrmcar> Yes. :P
[2016/02/17 14:00:15] <Tobbi> rbpi is actually a very bad device when it comes to building stuff.
[2016/02/17 14:00:23] <brmbrmcar> I decided to link i here before I fully checked it.
[2016/02/17 14:00:38] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Where is his level?
[2016/02/17 14:00:41] <Tobbi> eeh...
[2016/02/17 14:00:41] <Hume2> Well, Narre used to say that Overunderground Tower is impossible.
[2016/02/17 14:00:47] <Tobbi> *your level
[2016/02/17 14:00:51] <brmbrmcar> I may be ghosted!
[2016/02/17 14:00:52] <Hume2> Tobbi: It was that link.
[2016/02/17 14:01:01] <Tobbi> Hume2: It is not. There are people out there who have finished it.
[2016/02/17 14:01:01] <brmbrmcar> By OperationGT.
[2016/02/17 14:01:04] @ Quit: brmbrmcar: Disconnected by services
[2016/02/17 14:01:08] <Tobbi> what?
[2016/02/17 14:01:18] <Tobbi> How did that happen?
[2016/02/17 14:01:33] <Hume2> I know, Narre managed that to do it himself as well.
[2016/02/17 14:01:42] <Tobbi> leyyin: Are you still ignoring brmbrmcar, by the way?
[2016/02/17 14:01:43] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux

[2016/02/17 14:02:03] <Tobbi> okay, that's a yes. :P
[2016/02/17 14:02:03] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/02/17 14:02:15] <Hume2> It's very car and such brmbrm :D
[2016/02/17 14:02:31] <Tobbi> Also, I hate all salad dressings besides caesar dressings.
[2016/02/17 14:02:36] <Tobbi> And I can't find that anywhere in stores.
[2016/02/17 14:02:42] <Tobbi> So I might have to make it myself.
[2016/02/17 14:02:53] <leyyin> do you get murdered when you eat salad?
[2016/02/17 14:03:00] <Tobbi> leyyin: Uh, no?
[2016/02/17 14:03:01] <Tobbi> Why?
[2016/02/17 14:03:05] <leyyin> caesar dressing
[2016/02/17 14:03:09] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/02/17 14:03:19] <Hume2> Tobbi: After you'll rule the world, you can order them to sell it :D

[2016/02/17 14:05:03] <leyyin> I am a savage, I only eat meat I hunt
[2016/02/17 14:05:25] <Tobbi> leyyin: You can hunt meat at any supermarket.
[2016/02/17 14:05:34] <Tobbi> Also, vegetarians eat my food's food.
[2016/02/17 14:05:58] <Hume2> Tobbi: https://paste.kde.org/pbacldbvv
[2016/02/17 14:06:09] <brmbrmcar> So I eat your food's food!
[2016/02/17 14:06:44] <Tobbi> Let's see.
[2016/02/17 14:06:48] <Hume2> I eat such universal food, bread.
[2016/02/17 14:06:57] <Hume2> Not Bernd :D
[2016/02/17 14:07:33] <Hume2> Not beacuse I can't have anything else, but my imagination is poor.
[2016/02/17 14:10:53] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Your level is crazy hard.
[2016/02/17 14:11:14] <Hume2> It's crazy impossible, I guess :D
[2016/02/17 14:11:23] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/17 14:11:43] <brmbrmcar> Ithink it is possible...
[2016/02/17 14:11:48] <Hume2> 7-tiles jump is impossible in gravity 10.
[2016/02/17 14:11:59] <brmbrmcar> OK
[2016/02/17 14:12:07] <Hume2> Like upwards.
[2016/02/17 14:12:41] <Hume2> Sideways it's 13 tiles, without any speed modifiers such as wind or ice.
[2016/02/17 14:13:13] <Hume2> Assuming that 13-tiles horizontal jump is hard, but possible.
[2016/02/17 14:13:16] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You *think*?
[2016/02/17 14:13:21] <Tobbi> You haven't tried the level yourself?
[2016/02/17 14:13:35] <brmbrmcar> it is impossible, but i fixed
[2016/02/17 14:13:43] <brmbrmcar> mhold on
[2016/02/17 14:13:52] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Create your own worldmap.
[2016/02/17 14:13:53] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/17 14:14:04] <Hume2> Hold "on" of 5 secounds:D
[2016/02/17 14:14:19] <Hume2> This will turn off your computer.

[2016/02/17 14:15:35] * Hume2 tries
[2016/02/17 14:17:14] <Tobbi> I have no idea how to make that other jump.
[2016/02/17 14:17:22] <Hume2> The same here.
[2016/02/17 14:17:29] <brmbrmcar> Which one?
[2016/02/17 14:17:37] <Hume2> That overhang.
[2016/02/17 14:17:52] <Tobbi> yup.
[2016/02/17 14:17:58] <brmbrmcar> OK
[2016/02/17 14:18:15] <Tobbi> Hume2: We don't have a way to display Tux's position, do we?
[2016/02/17 14:18:23] <Tobbi> We should have a way.

[2016/02/17 14:19:58] <Hume2> It looks like it doesn't work for me though.
[2016/02/17 14:20:02] <brmbrmcar> Argh!
[2016/02/17 14:20:05] <brmbrmcar> I know!
[2016/02/17 14:20:12] <Tobbi> Hume2: not from the console.
[2016/02/17 14:20:40] <Hume2> Yeah, maybe that's it.
[2016/02/17 14:21:26] <brmbrmcar> Here! https://paste.kde.org/paicamy7q
[2016/02/17 14:21:39] <brmbrmcar> Now I'll try ghosting myself again.
[2016/02/17 14:21:43] <brmbrmcar> To save time
[2016/02/17 14:23:31] <brmbrmcar> It is crazily hard, but possible
[2016/02/17 14:24:20] <brmbrmcar> Except anither part!
[2016/02/17 14:26:31] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: can you make the jump here? http://screencast.com/t/g0ot9ekQ
[2016/02/17 14:26:33] <Hume2> That is impossible, isn't it?
[2016/02/17 14:26:50] <Hume2> Tobbi: He's just fixed it.
[2016/02/17 14:26:51] <Tobbi> I know that I can't.
[2016/02/17 14:26:52] <Tobbi> ah.
[2016/02/17 14:27:11] <Tobbi> Wait, no, the last paste still shows that error.
[2016/02/17 14:31:53] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: The jump at the end is still impossible.
[2016/02/17 14:32:01] <brmbrmcar> I thought so
[2016/02/17 14:32:08] <Hume2> Tobbi: Do you really have https://paste.kde.org/paicamy7q ?
[2016/02/17 14:32:23] <Tobbi> Hume2: maybe not.
[2016/02/17 14:32:56] <Tobbi> No, I probably saved under the wrong name.

[2016/02/17 14:40:50] <Tobbi> Also, please work on the scenery.
[2016/02/17 14:40:56] <Tobbi> Currently, it just doesn't look beautiful.
[2016/02/17 14:40:56] <Hume2> Tobbi: I thought so, altrough we have TeraTux Reborn.
[2016/02/17 14:41:33] <Hume2> OK, so firstly, close that mad contest.

[2016/02/17 14:41:58] <Hume2> No, they don't.
[2016/02/17 14:42:08] <Hume2> They think that it's cool.

[2016/02/17 14:54:27] <Tobbi> Okay, I didn't.
[2016/02/17 14:54:33] <Tobbi> Yet, our sliding mechanics are annoying.
[2016/02/17 14:55:33] <Hume2> By the way, hasn't mt said anything about cherry-picking to a 0.4.1 branch?
[2016/02/17 14:57:31] <Tobbi> Yes, but that can be done afterwards.
[2016/02/17 14:58:57] <Hume2> We are now 288 commits ahead from 0.4.0.
[2016/02/17 14:59:28] <Tobbi> Hume2: Most of it is the improved parser
[2016/02/17 14:59:49] <Hume2> That's possible.
[2016/02/17 15:04:11] <Hume2> OK, who all here want's to participate in designing the story?

[2016/02/17 15:04:51] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "What story?"
[2016/02/17 15:04:56] <Hume2> The story of SuperTux.
[2016/02/17 15:05:10] <brmbrmcar> Anyone from the UK will have lauhed at what I just wrote!
[2016/02/17 15:05:29] <brmbrmcar> ok
[2016/02/17 15:06:07] <Hume2> Many addons have currently a better story than we have D:
[2016/02/17 15:06:22] <Hume2> OK, some addons.
[2016/02/17 15:13:41] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Anyone who knows how to use dict.cc will laugh at it as well.
[2016/02/17 15:13:56] <Tobbi> Not all of them, no.
[2016/02/17 15:17:28] <Hume2> So assuming that I have a lot of SuperTux-related work…
[2016/02/17 15:17:35] <Hume2> And limited time…
[2016/02/17 15:18:20] <Hume2> I think I could temporarily leave editor and do something else instead.
[2016/02/17 15:18:53] <Hume2> It will be for GSoc, I hope.

[2016/02/18 04:10:19] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Okay, that's true.
[2016/02/18 04:13:33] @ OperationGT joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/18 04:14:07] <OperationGT> do you know what the best supertux editor is for windows 10?
[2016/02/18 04:18:23] <Tobbi> OperationGT: You can try the C# one. Flexlay doesn't have enough features...
[2016/02/18 04:18:27] <Tobbi> (yet)
[2016/02/18 04:18:46] <OperationGT> ok
[2016/02/18 04:20:03] <Tobbi> OperationGT: Actually, if you want, you can help develop it? Would be up for it?
[2016/02/18 04:20:53] <OperationGT> two seconds...
[2016/02/18 04:21:31] <Tobbi> sure
[2016/02/18 04:22:40] <OperationGT> i would, but it's difficult for me to download an editor
[2016/02/18 04:24:30] <Tobbi> OperationGT: What are you having trouble with?
[2016/02/18 04:25:24] <OperationGT> downloading an editor, but my friend has found me one, and it'll take around an hour to complete
[2016/02/18 04:25:32] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/02/18 04:25:36] <OperationGT> mono
[2016/02/18 04:26:52] <Tobbi> Mono might be a challenge to get working.
[2016/02/18 04:26:56] <Tobbi> We'll have to see...
[2016/02/18 04:27:14] <OperationGT> yeah, i've heard of something similar about mono
[2016/02/18 04:27:26] <Tobbi> I meant the editor, not mono itself.
[2016/02/18 04:28:20] <OperationGT> yeah, i know
[2016/02/18 04:29:08] <brmbrmcar> Where is the mono executable anyway?
[2016/02/18 04:29:18] <brmbrmcar> for the editor
[2016/02/18 04:29:54] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: iirc, it's called supertux-editor and might be in bin/Debug (?)
[2016/02/18 04:30:00] <brmbrmcar> ok
[2016/02/18 04:30:19] <brmbrmcar> Does it need external files?
[2016/02/18 04:30:27] <Tobbi> Mono, GTK#
[2016/02/18 04:30:27] <brmbrmcar> Or will the zip work?
[2016/02/18 04:30:30] <Tobbi> and not sure about other dependencies.
[2016/02/18 04:30:39] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I don't know. How did you create that last level?
[2016/02/18 04:30:54] <brmbrmcar> I'm helping OperationGT.
[2016/02/18 04:31:03] <brmbrmcar> I'm on Ubuntu, and usedv PPA
[2016/02/18 04:31:13] <Tobbi> ah okay, I don't know anything about that.

[2016/02/18 06:28:23] <Tobbi> OperationGT: There's a makefile in there, isn't there?
[2016/02/18 06:28:34] <OperationGT> what, in mono?
[2016/02/18 06:29:08] <Tobbi> OperationGT: No, in the editor repo.
[2016/02/18 06:29:13] <Tobbi> or whatever tarball you downloaded.
[2016/02/18 06:29:29] <OperationGT> i have no clue what that means..
[2016/02/18 06:29:46] <brmbrmcar> He hasn't got it1
[2016/02/18 06:30:15] <Tobbi> OperationGT: What have you done so far?
[2016/02/18 06:30:40] <OperationGT> apparentely nothing...? not too sure
[2016/02/18 06:30:59] <brmbrmcar> He did the GTK# and mono stuff
[2016/02/18 06:30:59] <Tobbi> OperationGT: Okay, start by installing Mono and GTK# if you haven't already.
[2016/02/18 06:31:10] <Tobbi> ok.
[2016/02/18 06:31:12] <brmbrmcar> he wants the repo, which I gave him.
[2016/02/18 06:31:24] <brmbrmcar> OIs the the zip fine enough?
[2016/02/18 06:31:35] <OperationGT> wait i have an editor now, so... yeah
[2016/02/18 06:31:37] <Tobbi> Both is fine.
[2016/02/18 06:31:56] <brmbrmcar> How do you use a makefile on Windows?
[2016/02/18 06:32:05] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I am not sure...

[2016/02/18 12:45:35] <brmbrmcar> is flexlay able to run from windows 10?
[2016/02/18 12:46:07] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Yes, as long as you have python installed and all the packages.
[2016/02/18 12:46:22] <brmbrmcar> ok

[2016/02/18 13:08:34] <brmbrmcar> How doyouinstall pyqr4?

[2016/02/18 13:12:47] <Tobbi> We could actually need a lot more people.
[2016/02/18 13:12:51] <Tobbi> working on flexlay.
[2016/02/18 13:14:21] <brmbrmcar> What is a proper download for pyqt?
[2016/02/18 13:14:27] <brmbrmcar> windows
[2016/02/18 13:14:49] <brmbrmcar> without nsi
[2016/02/18 13:16:18] <mt> http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro according to my package manager
[2016/02/18 13:16:26] <mt> Windows binaries are available there
[2016/02/18 13:16:36] <mt> I think you'd want PyQt4
[2016/02/18 13:17:00] <mt> Tobbi: about flexlay; you don't need python for the other one
[2016/02/18 13:17:06] <Tobbi> Yes, right.
[2016/02/18 13:17:07] <mt> pyqt is needed for the GUI
[2016/02/18 13:17:23] <Tobbi> But we should prefer the old editor until flexlay is in a usable state.
[2016/02/18 13:17:30] <Tobbi> It's currently just a pain in the butt...
[2016/02/18 13:18:18] <mt> brmbrmcar asked about *flexlay*, so we're giving him advice about flexlay
[2016/02/18 13:19:11] <mt> people use flexlay -> people get annoyed by the lack of features -> people contribute to flexlay -> :D
[2016/02/18 13:19:35] <brmbrmcar> hmmm... maybe not OperationGT
[2016/02/18 13:19:57] <brmbrmcar> He will just ask me to add stuff!
[2016/02/18 13:20:04] <Tobbi> mt: No, no one contributes to flexlay :P
[2016/02/18 13:20:18] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Why did he kick me from that channel, anyway?
[2016/02/18 13:20:29] <brmbrmcar> dunno
[2016/02/18 13:20:42] <mt> >#brmbrmbus
[2016/02/18 13:21:02] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/18 13:21:25] <mt> brmbrmcar: are you involved in a project that's on-topic by freenode's policies? otherwise you should actually move to ##brmbrmbus
[2016/02/18 13:22:05] <brmbrmcar> ok
[2016/02/18 13:22:16] <brmbrmcar> who cares?
[2016/02/18 13:22:27] <mt> in the end, you do
[2016/02/18 13:22:34] <brmbrmcar> ok
[2016/02/18 13:23:08] <mt> because if your nick gets dropped for some (silly) reason, regardless of actual succession rules the channel will be transferred over to the `freenode-staff` account
[2016/02/18 13:23:16] <brmbrmcar> ok
[2016/02/18 13:23:23] <mt> and then, you have to be an on-topic project to regain access
[2016/02/18 13:23:33] <mt> see https://blog.freenode.net/2008/04/registering-a-channel-on-freenode/ and https://freenode.net/policy.shtml#channelnaming
[2016/02/18 13:23:36] <brmbrmcar> it happened with #oswars, I think
[2016/02/18 13:23:50] <mt> freenode-staff also happened to this channel, iirc
[2016/02/18 13:23:58] <brmbrmcar> really?
[2016/02/18 13:23:58] <mt> but we're an on-topic project, so :D
[2016/02/18 13:25:11] <mt> and I don't know, with GMS you'll at least not be able to register primary channels without staff approval anymore
[2016/02/18 13:25:28] <mt> I don't think off-topic primary channels will be purged though

[2016/02/20 09:38:53] <sydney_untangle> Actually...

[2016/02/20 09:41:22] <Hume2> Wow, it worked.
[2016/02/20 09:42:53] <Tobbi> Hume2: Isn't the default for worldmap color white anyway?
[2016/02/20 09:43:25] <Hume2> Tobbi: Do you think the level titles I proposed?
[2016/02/20 09:43:31] <Hume2> that my PR?
[2016/02/20 09:43:33] <Tobbi> Hume2: yes.
[2016/02/20 09:43:38] <Hume2> Yes, it is.
[2016/02/20 09:43:49] <Tobbi> Hume2: So, why did you add (color 1 1 1) to the worldmap?
[2016/02/20 09:44:02] <Hume2> Because the editor sucks.
[2016/02/20 09:45:23] <Tobbi> Ok.
[2016/02/20 09:55:29] <sydney_untangle> mt: Im stuck behind NAT that my ISP reinforces.
[2016/02/20 09:56:19] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: NAT = the sound a duck makes.
[2016/02/20 10:00:54] <mt> sydney_untangle: well, you could also just squash the entire log repo to one commit, and then just git commit --amend --date=now instead of git commit -m 'message' so it stays one commit
[2016/02/20 10:01:25] <mt> and maybe only update the logs every 6 hours or so
[2016/02/20 10:03:25] <Tobbi> If I could only get this log server working.
[2016/02/20 10:03:39] <Tobbi> But the problems is that it exceeds the capacity of my 4 GB SD card.
[2016/02/20 10:03:41] <Tobbi> Or is it only 2 GB
[2016/02/20 10:03:42] <mt> which log server?
[2016/02/20 10:03:55] <Tobbi> mt: I tried to compile a log server which is used by...eeh...
[2016/02/20 10:03:57] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2016/02/20 10:04:31] <Tobbi> mt: botbot.me is open source.
[2016/02/20 10:04:46] <Tobbi> I tried to compile it but ran out of space on my rbpi.
[2016/02/20 10:05:06] <mt> what I'd like is a log that you can edit
[2016/02/20 10:05:39] <Tobbi> mt: not sure about it, but I tried https://github.com/BotBotMe/botbot-bot
[2016/02/20 10:06:19] <mt> well
[2016/02/20 10:06:42] <mt> if you could run a client for the logs on that RPi, https://gist.github.com/maxteufel/5cb5a2345b53fa2dafc4
[2016/02/20 10:06:51] <mt> also works without ZNC
[2016/02/20 10:07:09] <mt> you'd just have to change the path
[2016/02/20 10:07:21] <Tobbi> hrm, yeah, but that's not really as user-friendly.
[2016/02/20 10:07:41] <Tobbi> Also, I don't actually want to open ports on my router.
[2016/02/20 10:07:48] <mt> it does its job
[2016/02/20 10:08:05] <mt> you could also put a list with possible paths on the main page
[2016/02/20 10:08:45] <Tobbi> Hrm, yeah, not sure.
[2016/02/20 10:08:54] <Tobbi> Now that I have my bouncer, I don't need logs.
[2016/02/20 10:08:57] <Tobbi> I'm online anyway.
[2016/02/20 10:13:28] <sydney_untangle> Arg, i cannot seem to get html5 video to play...

[2016/02/20 10:20:33] <Tobbi> Hrm.
[2016/02/20 10:20:40] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/02/20 10:21:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: What about other tilemaps?
[2016/02/20 10:22:10] <Hume2> I didn't focused on them so far.
[2016/02/20 10:22:17] <Hume2> Well, only on some of them.
[2016/02/20 10:22:31] <Hume2> When there were more than 3.
[2016/02/20 10:24:06] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2016/02/20 10:24:13] <Tobbi> It's not that important anyway.

[2016/02/20 10:24:43] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: No.

[2016/02/20 10:25:57] <sydney_untangle> lol.
[2016/02/20 10:26:43] <mt> a repo shouldn't be larger than 1 GB
[2016/02/20 10:26:52] <mt> there's a hard limit at some point, iirc

[2016/02/20 10:36:02] <tomreyn> yes the client is open source, but the server component is not well documented, on purpose one might assume. i'd recommend git-annex instead.
[2016/02/20 10:36:07] <sydney_untangle> Here is another question, i need to generate countdown videos with a physical countdown being shown, any clue on how to do that without having to go through every frame in gimp or such?

[2016/02/20 11:02:41] <mt> can you also keep normal git-managed files in a git-annex repo?
[2016/02/20 11:03:05] <tomreyn> it stores references to large files in git, and manegs them at their original location
[2016/02/20 11:03:33] <tomreyn> you can have multiple storage backends, using different protocols

[2016/02/20 12:09:01] <Tobbi> Hume2: German TV (Kinderkanal) wants to check out SuperTux.
[2016/02/20 12:09:23] <Hume2> Wichtig?
[2016/02/20 12:09:36] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yes, this is important.
[2016/02/20 12:09:51] <Hume2> OK, what shall we do?
[2016/02/20 12:09:53] <Tobbi> Hume2: Problem is: They want someone to sign an agreement...
[2016/02/20 12:10:03] <Tobbi> I am not sure if it's in compliance with the GPL v2.
[2016/02/20 12:10:18] <Tobbi> I don't think the past authors of ST will have anything against it, though.
[2016/02/20 12:10:29] <Hume2> I think so.
[2016/02/20 12:10:52] <Tobbi> Hume2: http://pastebin.com/cqMkdWjE
[2016/02/20 12:12:23] <Tobbi> I don't have the right to sign this agreement.
[2016/02/20 12:12:24] <Hume2> I think they could use it even without the signature.
[2016/02/20 12:12:29] <Tobbi> I think so.
[2016/02/20 12:12:36] <Tobbi> Let me check up on that.
[2016/02/20 12:14:17] <Hume2> KiKA? Like Bernd das Brod plays SuperTux? :P
[2016/02/20 12:14:29] <Tobbi> Hume2: Bernd das Brot is indeed on KIKA :D
[2016/02/20 12:16:36] <Tobbi> Hume2: But, I assume that this could get us some momentum.
[2016/02/20 12:17:07] <Hume2> Yeah, no haste.
[2016/02/20 12:17:46] <Hume2> Maybe I misread this, so alternative answer is: That's good.
[2016/02/20 12:18:35] <Tobbi> Hume2: I will ask them whether they could send me a recording of the episode...
[2016/02/20 12:19:00] <Tobbi> I really like this, in theory.
[2016/02/20 12:19:10] <Hume2> OK, I like this too.
[2016/02/20 12:19:47] <brmbrmcar> What?
[2016/02/20 12:20:03] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: German television wants to feature SuperTux.
[2016/02/20 12:20:11] <Tobbi> German children television, that is :)
[2016/02/20 12:20:46] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/20 12:21:01] <brmbrmcar> I like that.
[2016/02/20 12:23:08] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Problem is: I need to ask whether there are legal difficulties involved...
[2016/02/20 12:23:22] <brmbrmcar> hmmm
[2016/02/20 12:23:32] <brmbrmcar> I wouldn't think so myself.
[2016/02/20 12:23:38] <brmbrmcar> But I'm no lawyer
[2016/02/20 12:24:06] <mt> Could you ask them to ask their lawyer?
[2016/02/20 12:24:38] <Hume2> Yes, but don't ask two lawyers :P
[2016/02/20 12:24:50] <Hume2> Else you would be only more confused.
[2016/02/20 12:25:04] <mt> or we could ask this project providing lawyers for open source communities
[2016/02/20 12:25:11] <mt> I don't remember the name anymore
[2016/02/20 12:26:52] <mt> Well fact is
[2016/02/20 12:27:03] <mt> they can do anything that's allowed by GPL/CC-BY-SA
[2016/02/20 12:27:16] <Tobbi> mt: I just asked the Wikipedia law experts...
[2016/02/20 12:27:21] <Tobbi> Well, we could ask a lawyer, yes.
[2016/02/20 12:27:45] <Tobbi> mt: They probably want confirmation... I wonder whether I could just sign it.
[2016/02/20 12:27:52] <mt> but they should pay attention to parts that we are allowed to redistribute but don't have fyll copyright on
[2016/02/20 12:28:09] <mt> in fact, they shouldn't need us to sign anything
[2016/02/20 12:28:59] <Tobbi> mt: The thing is: They probably expect a reply from "mailing list address" which we can't give :D
[2016/02/20 12:29:00] <mt> everything all authors are okay with is in the license
[2016/02/20 12:29:23] <mt> if not, they'd have to ask all authors involved
[2016/02/20 12:29:38] <mt> *they* have to do that, not *us*
[2016/02/20 12:29:45] <Tobbi> Right.
[2016/02/20 12:30:00] <Tobbi> mt: However, they'll probably fear the legal implications...
[2016/02/20 12:30:02] <mt> and because they probably won't do that
[2016/02/20 12:30:05] <Tobbi> Yeah.
[2016/02/20 12:30:11] <mt> they should get a lawyer understanding the licenses
[2016/02/20 12:30:25] <Tobbi> mt: But I think getting featured on TV is great...problem is we can't make exceptions, can we?
[2016/02/20 12:30:35] <mt> if they can't, they shouldn't be doing this anyway

[2016/02/20 12:36:40] <mt> shouldn't there be something like urheberrechte@(whatever).de
[2016/02/20 12:37:19] <mt> on the other hand
[2016/02/20 12:37:37] <Tobbi> mt: She might be a junior employee not getting her own e-mail address.
[2016/02/20 12:37:41] <mt> that document they want us to sign wouldn't allow any third-party to bypass licensing
[2016/02/20 12:37:56] <mt> any third-party that's not German TV
[2016/02/20 12:38:11] <Tobbi> We also need to forward the STK email to the right folks.
[2016/02/20 12:38:43] <mt> >merchandising
[2016/02/20 12:38:56] <mt> that's going a bit too far, heh
[2016/02/20 12:39:08] <Tobbi> mt: Merchandising?
[2016/02/20 12:39:26] <brmbrmcar> huh?
[2016/02/20 12:40:03] <mt> like, t-shirts with supertux and KiKa logo?
[2016/02/20 12:40:10] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/20 12:40:18] <Tobbi> mt: Why would they want to do that?
[2016/02/20 12:40:34] <mt> "and for all non-broadcasting purposes (e.g. DVD, CD, online, including ondemand and livestreaming – with and without download, public screening, print, merchandising)"
[2016/02/20 12:40:38] <mt> don't ask me
[2016/02/20 12:40:55] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/02/20 12:41:02] <Tobbi> This is extremely difficult.
[2016/02/20 12:44:38] <Tobbi> mt: What are those open source lawyers?
[2016/02/20 12:45:47] <Tobbi> mt: I found https://www.softwarefreedom.org/about/contact/
[2016/02/20 12:45:51] <Tobbi> Maybe that's it.
[2016/02/20 12:46:28] <mt> possible

[2016/02/20 12:56:08] <Tobbi> shit.
[2016/02/20 12:56:32] <Tobbi> Uh, sorry for the expletive...
[2016/02/20 12:57:14] <mt> well
[2016/02/20 12:57:21] <mt> nothing that can be considered a signature
[2016/02/20 12:57:28] <Tobbi> Sure, that's right...
[2016/02/20 12:57:48] <mt> and even if that'd be the case, others aren't contractual partners
[2016/02/20 12:57:55] <Tobbi> mt: Anyway, I'll probably send a message saying that we'll ask for legal advice on our own...?
[2016/02/20 12:58:00] <mt> that means that they could actually take legal actions
[2016/02/20 12:58:00] <Tobbi> Sound good?
[2016/02/20 12:58:06] <mt> yes
[2016/02/20 12:58:14] <Tobbi> I can assume she doesn't know anything about open source projects..
[2016/02/20 12:58:18] <mt> on the other hand
[2016/02/20 12:58:28] <mt> they should read the license(s)
[2016/02/20 12:58:34] <mt> and follow them
[2016/02/20 12:58:38] <mt> and if they don't
[2016/02/20 12:58:52] <mt> it's not my problem when someone's taking legal action
[2016/02/20 13:00:04] <Tobbi> mt: True, but they're likely not going to do that.

[2016/02/20 13:00:18] <Hume2> 6,4MB -> 5,5MB
[2016/02/20 13:00:44] <mt> they have lawyers and they have money
[2016/02/20 13:00:52] <mt> sure they can let these lawyers read the licenses
[2016/02/20 13:02:14] <Tobbi> mt: They only have limited time. And Grit is only a small employee...
[2016/02/20 13:03:16] <mt> I'm actually unsure if the signature would make the person signing this responsible for others taking legal action
[2016/02/20 13:03:21] <mt> So I'd not sign that
[2016/02/20 13:03:45] <mt> really, what giby said is actually true

[2016/02/20 13:05:24] <Hume2> If they used it illegally, who is the damaged one?
[2016/02/20 13:05:52] <mt> most likely the artist(s)
[2016/02/20 13:06:06] <mt> showing code running isn't really violating copyright, I guess
[2016/02/20 13:06:11] <Tobbi> It is *extremely* difficult.
[2016/02/20 13:06:30] <brmbrmcar> What dothey want to do excatly?
[2016/02/20 13:06:35] <Hume2> Well, I ask another way.
[2016/02/20 13:06:45] <mt> but anyway, in Germany you could just ask a lawyer to send them an Abmahnung when they violate copyright, even if you don't own that
[2016/02/20 13:06:57] <Hume2> If they used it illegally, who is willing to complain?
[2016/02/20 13:07:17] <mt> everyone in Germany could, to put it that way
[2016/02/20 13:07:28] <Hume2> Like who has a reason to complain?
[2016/02/20 13:07:42] <mt> every German resident who sees them violating German law
[2016/02/20 13:08:17] <Hume2> And do everyone see on firs sight in Germany that it's violating the law?
[2016/02/20 13:08:30] <Hume2> s/firs/first/
[2016/02/20 13:08:30] <red_bot> Hume2 meant: "And do everyone see on first sight in Germany that it's violating the law?"
[2016/02/20 13:08:35] <mt> most people probably wouldn't care
[2016/02/20 13:08:48] <Hume2> Well, I ask who could care.
[2016/02/20 13:09:01] <mt> but I mean, heh, Tobbi is German, many of the old team members are Germans, I'm German.
[2016/02/20 13:09:17] <Tobbi> mt: I think most of the old team members would consider it an honor.
[2016/02/20 13:09:34] <mt> Yes, probably
[2016/02/20 13:09:50] <Hume2> OK, mt, do you watch TV and look for each illegality that is broadcasted?
[2016/02/20 13:10:12] <mt> Hume2: no, but I could if it's about SuperTux
[2016/02/20 13:10:34] <mt> also, they're most likely putting it online later on
[2016/02/20 13:10:40] <Hume2> OK, have you ever complained about an illegality in TV?
[2016/02/20 13:10:43] <mt> no
[2016/02/20 13:10:54] <Hume2> Do you know anyone who has?
[2016/02/20 13:10:55] <mt> because there was nothing that I'd care about
[2016/02/20 13:10:56] <brmbrmcar> I never complain, but I like looking
[2016/02/20 13:11:16] <mt> you realize, SuperTux might be something I care more about than other things?
[2016/02/20 13:11:49] <Hume2> Yeah, I know, I just wanted to consider it that way.
[2016/02/20 13:12:02] <mt> I don't really care (and can't verify) if they're illegaly using a soundtrack, a logo, whatever of someone I don't know
[2016/02/20 13:13:10] <Hume2> It's far easier to tell all ST developers that it's OK and to not complain.
[2016/02/20 13:13:27] <Hume2> You know, the jungle of laws.
[2016/02/20 13:14:15] <Hume2> I think that we can sign it to them and
[2016/02/20 13:14:17] <mt> I *think* they also make the one signing responsible for legal actions they might face
[2016/02/20 13:14:31] <mt> So if $some_old_contributor realizes that, is angry and sues them
[2016/02/20 13:14:32] <Hume2> Well...
[2016/02/20 13:14:47] <mt> The person signing it (is there a noun for that?) has a problem
[2016/02/20 13:15:00] <Hume2> That's right.
[2016/02/20 13:17:33] <Tobbi> mt: http://pastebin.com/qScWSkYD
[2016/02/20 13:17:36] <Tobbi> And others...
[2016/02/20 13:17:41] <Tobbi> how does that sound.
[2016/02/20 13:18:18] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/20 13:18:35] <brmbrmcar> looks good
[2016/02/20 13:18:37] <brmbrmcar> to me
[2016/02/20 13:19:25] <Hume2> It sounds well.
[2016/02/20 13:19:44] <Tobbi> Wait, auf Sie -> "auf Ihr Anliegen"
[2016/02/20 13:19:46] <mt> sounds good
[2016/02/20 13:20:28] <Tobbi> I'll send it from the supertuxteam@ address.
[2016/02/20 13:21:19] <mt> don't forget to actually CC: them
[2016/02/20 13:21:30] <Tobbi> Oh no.
[2016/02/20 13:21:32] <mt> they probably didn't subscribe to the mailing list
[2016/02/20 13:21:43] <Tobbi> mt: Yeah, also it's now in the queue...
[2016/02/20 13:21:51] <Tobbi> Since I sent it from supertuxteam@...
[2016/02/20 13:22:04] <Tobbi> Better send it from tobbi@
[2016/02/20 13:24:52] <Tobbi> mt: Can I send reply-to to supertuxteam@ ?
[2016/02/20 13:25:14] <mt> yeah, I guess; also why can't you send it from supertuxteam@
[2016/02/20 13:25:38] <Tobbi> mt: Not to the mailing list, because sender email requires approval.
[2016/02/20 13:25:52] <mt> and you don't have admin access?
[2016/02/20 13:26:21] <Tobbi> mt: No.
[2016/02/20 13:26:22] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/20 13:26:27] <mt> ok then
[2016/02/20 13:26:37] <Tobbi> I'll also add a note regarding SuperTux Kart.
[2016/02/20 13:29:03] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/02/20 13:29:07] <Tobbi> So, that's settled.
[2016/02/20 13:29:30] <mt> Tobbi: re http://lists.lethargik.org/pipermail/supertux-devel-lethargik.org/2016-February/000052.html (and the thread): could you reply that debian (don't know about ubuntu) packages/packaged supertux 0.4 for all supported platforms
[2016/02/20 13:29:40] <Tobbi> mt: Soon.
[2016/02/20 13:29:46] <Tobbi> Let me just forward that e-mail to the stk mailing list.
[2016/02/20 13:30:08] <mt> https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=supertux&suite=sid

[2016/02/20 13:32:56] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/20 13:33:20] <brmbrmcar> Want me to take part?
[2016/02/20 13:33:30] <Hume2> No, please.
[2016/02/20 13:33:53] <Hume2> We don't need more jojin/qujit messages.
[2016/02/20 13:34:09] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2016/02/20 13:35:00] <Hume2> Are you speaking about that join/quit contest, son't you?
[2016/02/20 13:35:10] <brmbrmcar> Yes
[2016/02/20 13:35:12] <mt> Sure I'll make a vendor prefixed IRCv3 capability for my IRC library where JOIN and QUIT on protocol level are assumed to be JOJIN/QUJIT :D
[2016/02/20 13:35:25] <Hume2> :D

[2016/02/20 13:36:13] <brmbrmcar> add it :D
[2016/02/20 13:37:42] <mt> would probably be a less than 10 lines patch
[2016/02/20 13:37:56] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/02/20 13:38:23] <mt> I need to make sure it knows about the capability (so it can request it), and then just rewrite JOJIN and QUJIN to JOIN and QUIT
[2016/02/20 13:39:12] <Tobbi> Can anyone draft an e-mail re. legal advice?
[2016/02/20 13:39:23] <mt> what for
[2016/02/20 13:39:34] <Tobbi> eeh.
[2016/02/20 13:39:43] <Tobbi> I meant to https://www.softwarefreedom.org/about/team/
[2016/02/20 13:41:41] <mt> you know my opinion on this is that they should (waste) their own (or actually that of Germans who pay Rundfunkgebuehren -> most, I guess) money on this
[2016/02/20 13:42:29] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/02/20 13:42:51] <Tobbi> mt: But actually, that means that we'll be getting something back from them.
[2016/02/20 13:42:54] <Tobbi> Well, the project wil.
[2016/02/20 13:42:56] <Tobbi> *will
[2016/02/20 13:43:08] <Tobbi> recognition.
[2016/02/20 13:43:42] <mt> I know it might be nice to have some publicity on TV
[2016/02/20 13:44:55] <Tobbi> mt: Besides, Teletubbies are worse than SuperTux :P
[2016/02/20 13:45:15] <mt> :D
[2016/02/20 13:45:36] <brmbrmcar> Teletubbies!
[2016/02/20 13:45:41] <mt> let's just make them stream SuperTux all the time?!
[2016/02/20 13:45:59] <Tobbi> mt: Definitely adds value.
[2016/02/20 13:46:47] <Tobbi> mt: SuperTux makes them want to learn more about penguins and their natural habitats, about the different aggregates of snow, and a LOT more.
[2016/02/20 13:47:18] <mt> SuperTux makes people interested in physics! (Hume2 calculating mass of items...)
[2016/02/20 13:47:45] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/20 13:47:46] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/02/20 13:48:20] <mt> Speaking of that, where's our implementation of gravitational waves????
[2016/02/20 13:48:38] <Tobbi> SuperTux's? :D
[2016/02/20 13:48:40] <Tobbi> o.O
[2016/02/20 13:48:44] <Tobbi> This is gonna be complicated.
[2016/02/20 13:49:20] <mt> Or to be serious, I won't write an email to these software lawyers whatever people, at least not any time soon
[2016/02/20 13:49:26] <mt> If someone else wants, sure
[2016/02/20 13:49:44] <Tobbi> mt: I guess I'll do it.
[2016/02/20 13:50:02] <Tobbi> I like the matter...Legal stuff is interesting.
[2016/02/20 13:50:04] <mt> I doubt signing this would be possible
[2016/02/20 13:50:13] <Tobbi> Who knows...
[2016/02/20 13:50:17] <mt> at least not as a single person
[2016/02/20 13:51:00] <Tobbi> mt: If it's already permitted under the GPLv3 to publicly broadcast SuperTux, then I can as well sign it.
[2016/02/20 13:51:04] <Tobbi> Wouldn't make much of a difference
[2016/02/20 13:51:36] <mt> I'd especially read the last paragraph very carefully
[2016/02/20 13:51:44] <mt> I don't like what that one says
[2016/02/20 13:51:46] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2016/02/20 13:52:01] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2016/02/20 13:52:02] <Tobbi> no.
[2016/02/20 13:52:06] <Tobbi> I am not prepared to do that.
[2016/02/20 13:52:32] <Tobbi> I'll ask the open source lawyers.
[2016/02/20 13:53:50] <Tobbi> But, before that, I'll get some food...
[2016/02/20 13:54:02] <Tobbi> Döner FTW
[2016/02/20 13:54:50] <Tobbi> mt: Also, her German is not the yellow from the egg.
[2016/02/20 13:55:03] <Tobbi> It's like the German from Her Royal Highness Westerwave.
[2016/02/20 13:55:17] <Tobbi> Or the German outside minister (is he still?) ...Oettinger...
[2016/02/20 13:55:27] <Tobbi> eeh her English, I meant.

[2016/02/20 15:01:02] <mt> I should write a script that replaces the characters with unicode ones

[2016/02/20 15:10:48] <Tobbi> Hume2: Some of these checks can be automatic.
[2016/02/20 15:11:08] <mt> indeed, just like code style checkers
[2016/02/20 15:11:17] <Hume2> Yeah, like checking for empty tilemaps etc..
[2016/02/20 15:11:54] <Hume2> And how to ensure that the level is finishable?
[2016/02/20 15:12:27] <Tobbi> Hume2: That's probably best left to automatic checks.
[2016/02/20 15:12:33] <Tobbi> eeh to manual ones.
[2016/02/20 15:12:38] <Hume2> The only sollution I can think is being able to upload the level only after finishing it.
[2016/02/20 15:12:54] <Tobbi> Hume2: We don't have any way to check that.
[2016/02/20 15:13:02] <mt> there should also be a web interface to upload it
[2016/02/20 15:13:11] <Tobbi> Also, brmbrmcar is by nature exempt from submitting levels :P
[2016/02/20 15:13:12] <Hume2> Yeah, I know.
[2016/02/20 15:13:19] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/20 15:13:24] <mt> I'd generally suggest approving users manually
[2016/02/20 15:13:46] <mt> And if they still abuse level uploading, remove them and their levels
[2016/02/20 15:13:46] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2016/02/20 15:14:07] <Hume2> That's a possible sollution.
[2016/02/20 15:14:13] <Tobbi> But wait, we're a few steps ahead of ourselves...
[2016/02/20 15:14:21] <Tobbi> First we need to be accepted to GSoC.
[2016/02/20 15:14:26] <Hume2> Or approve levels/levelsets one by one.
[2016/02/20 15:15:12] <Hume2> Yeah, being accepted by GSoC is more important now.
[2016/02/20 15:15:31] <mt> there's nothing we can do now
[2016/02/20 15:15:38] <mt> except for waiting?
[2016/02/20 15:17:37] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2016/02/20 15:18:43] <Hume2> We can pretend that we are working on something important :P
[2016/02/20 15:19:27] <Tobbi> Hume2: We have done that way too often.
[2016/02/20 15:19:39] <Hume2> That's true.
[2016/02/20 15:20:08] <Hume2> Then we pretend that we are waiting :D
[2016/02/20 15:20:09] <mt> we should be working on 0.4.1
[2016/02/20 15:20:17] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/20 15:20:24] <Tobbi> I have fixed many bugs already.
[2016/02/20 15:20:49] <brmbrmcar> How un-buggy does it need to be?
[2016/02/20 15:20:51] <mt> we need to cherry-pick over the most important commits to the release/0.4 branch
[2016/02/20 15:20:53] <Tobbi> Can anyone test my fix for https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/322 ?
[2016/02/20 15:21:18] <mt> generally, if we don't fix a bug in 0.4.1
[2016/02/20 15:21:24] <mt> we could simply release 0.4.2
[2016/02/20 15:21:46] <Tobbi> Yeah, that's true.
[2016/02/20 15:22:09] <Tobbi> Also, does this need to be in 0.4.1? https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/333
[2016/02/20 15:22:13] <mt> might be annoying if some distros don't want to backport these patches or use the new versions
[2016/02/20 15:22:39] <mt> Tobbi: well, if you'd like to, we can release what's been fixed as 0.4.1
[2016/02/20 15:22:45] <mt> and move the other parts to 0.4.2
[2016/02/20 15:22:48] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I assign you to https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/319 ?
[2016/02/20 15:23:03] <Tobbi> mt: I am uncertain about this. I'd rather fix most of the urgent things first, like Windows.
[2016/02/20 15:23:24] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2016/02/20 15:23:29] <mt> I'd like to as well
[2016/02/20 15:23:34] <mt> but think about it this way
[2016/02/20 15:23:36] <brmbrmcar> what would i knw?
[2016/02/20 15:23:42] <mt> if we release 0.4.1 with fixes now
[2016/02/20 15:23:54] <mt> at least some part of the userbase will profit from the fixes
[2016/02/20 15:24:00] <Tobbi> That's true.
[2016/02/20 15:24:17] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You would gain knowledge in how to do git bisect.
[2016/02/20 15:24:35] <brmbrmcar> I'd suggest 0.4.0a if it wasn't for what hapened last time...
[2016/02/20 15:24:42] <brmbrmcar> git bisect?
[2016/02/20 15:24:45] <brmbrmcar> Oh no.
[2016/02/20 15:24:45] <Tobbi> mt: Can you cherry-pick the changes...?
[2016/02/20 15:24:53] <mt> not now
[2016/02/20 15:24:54] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: And NO! No .a please.
[2016/02/20 15:24:56] <mt> tomowrrow maybe
[2016/02/20 15:25:01] <Tobbi> mt: Tomorrow's fine.
[2016/02/20 15:25:02] <mt> s/w//
[2016/02/20 15:25:02] <red_bot> mt meant: "tomorrow maybe"
[2016/02/20 15:25:20] <mt> it will be quite a few fixes
[2016/02/20 15:25:28] <brmbrmcar> I know
[2016/02/20 15:25:33] <brmbrmcar> no .a
[2016/02/20 15:26:02] <Hume2> How big part of our commits will be in 0.4.1?
[2016/02/20 15:26:11] <Tobbi> We'll have to see..
[2016/02/20 15:26:26] <mt> Hume2, Tobbi, sydney_untangle: tell me (just leave a message here, I'll read it in the backlog anyway) if you'd like some non-obvious or larger bugfixes cherry-picked as well
[2016/02/20 15:26:38] <Tobbi> phew, I'll go through them.
[2016/02/20 15:26:40] <mt> otherwise I'll only cherry-pick small commits that don't seem dangerous
[2016/02/20 15:26:48] <Hume2> OK
[2016/02/20 15:27:10] <Tobbi> Commits since 0.4.0: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/compare/v0.4.0...master
[2016/02/20 15:27:10] <mt> e.g. if something was in another branch, you should tell me
[2016/02/20 15:31:10] <Tobbi> The list is quite hug.
[2016/02/20 15:31:11] <Tobbi> *huge
[2016/02/20 15:31:21] <Tobbi> 300 something commits.
[2016/02/20 15:31:26] @ Guest84220 is now known as OperationGT
[2016/02/20 15:31:52] <mt> 302, according to git describe --tags
[2016/02/20 15:32:13] <mt> I guess all const correctness fixes can be moved
[2016/02/20 15:32:33] <mt> as well as Hume2's level size reducements
[2016/02/20 15:34:09] <Hume2> Yeah, those should be safe.
[2016/02/20 15:34:41] <mt> unless limited tilemaps depend on something that's new in master
[2016/02/20 15:37:07] <Tobbi> I don't think so.
[2016/02/20 15:37:29] <Tobbi> I guess the buildsystem fixes can be moved as well.

[2016/02/20 15:40:01] <Hume2> Is my new badguy leafshot stable enough?
[2016/02/20 15:40:24] <Hume2> In fact, it's a bugfix too.
[2016/02/20 15:40:30] <Tobbi> Hume2: No, it's a new feature...iirc.
[2016/02/20 15:40:47] <Tobbi> new content is always a new feature.
[2016/02/20 15:41:03] <Tobbi> Actually, it is stable enough.
[2016/02/20 15:42:01] <Hume2> If you decide not to put it there, then don't put there also the other edits of the level "levels/world2/Two_Towers.stl".
[2016/02/20 15:42:13] <Tobbi> Oh, right.
[2016/02/20 15:42:16] <Hume2> You should be able to distinguish it well.
[2016/02/20 15:42:19] <Tobbi> that depends on that.
[2016/02/20 15:42:26] <Tobbi> No, mt should :P
[2016/02/20 15:42:39] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/20 15:47:14] <Tobbi> Guys, do we replace the freenode chat frame with a kiwiirc one?
[2016/02/20 15:47:19] <Tobbi> I actually like kiwiirc more.
[2016/02/20 15:48:17] <brmbrmcar> Nae captcha!
[2016/02/20 15:48:24] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What?
[2016/02/20 15:48:48] <brmbrmcar> There isn't a captcga there

[2016/02/20 19:23:29] <sydney_untangle> \o/. Its not the official chat client.

[2016/02/20 21:46:01] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I am going to remove the supertux irc logs entry in my menu on my website, so others looking at my website wont see the logs.
[2016/02/20 21:46:23] <sydney_untangle> Just the menu though.
[2016/02/20 23:02:14] <snadge> i like that addon.. but i think it needs a little bit more work
[2016/02/20 23:02:31] <snadge> a couple of those levels were just painful
[2016/02/20 23:03:22] <snadge> and i think with that.. i've finished every addon there is for supertux :(

[2016/02/21 03:41:48] <mt> so this is strange
[2016/02/21 03:42:00] <mt> I tried to split away the data directory using git-subtree
[2016/02/21 03:42:16] <mt> however in the split repo, there are now commits that don't touch data/
[2016/02/21 03:42:30] <mt> even though I only have data/ content in the actual tree
[2016/02/21 03:45:09] @ Quit: tux|dude: Quit: Leaving
[2016/02/21 03:48:08] <mt> hm interesting
[2016/02/21 03:48:17] <mt> so this isn't supposed to be used as a submodule
[2016/02/21 04:04:43] <Tobbi> mt: If you want, I can try to replace the freenode client with the kiwiirc one.
[2016/02/21 04:10:08] <Tobbi> mt: Also, it doesn't hurt to have these commits there, does it?
[2016/02/21 04:10:23] <Tobbi> If there are commits not touching data/, that's fine with me.
[2016/02/21 04:10:30] <Tobbi> The other way round would be worse.
[2016/02/21 04:10:35] <mt> I'd rather not want commit pollution
[2016/02/21 04:10:46] <mt> especially not if I have no idea why it happens
[2016/02/21 04:11:26] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/21 04:11:32] <Tobbi> mt: Is there a better solution than git subtree?
[2016/02/21 04:11:53] <mt> For now, I'll just leave it
[2016/02/21 04:12:09] <Tobbi> ok.
[2016/02/21 04:12:11] <mt> and now
[2016/02/21 04:12:20] <mt> there's some unstaged changes that I didn't make
[2016/02/21 04:12:35] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/02/21 04:12:44] <mt> heck, they even appear in a new clone
[2016/02/21 04:13:22] <mt> If I remove the two actual lines in .gitattributes they disappear
[2016/02/21 04:13:39] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/21 04:13:56] <Tobbi> Sounds like a problem I had but never solved.
[2016/02/21 04:13:57] <mt> now I added them again
[2016/02/21 04:14:07] <mt> and there are no unstaged changes anymore
[2016/02/21 04:14:27] <Tobbi> mt: Re German TV: Hiker is getting in touch with them for STK...I've asked him to tell us what he agreed upon.
[2016/02/21 04:15:40] <mt> ## release/0.4...origin/release/0.4 [ahead 302]
[2016/02/21 04:15:53] <mt> I'll now remove the commits we don't want in 0.4.1
[2016/02/21 04:15:56] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/02/21 04:16:02] <mt> please don't push to master for now
[2016/02/21 04:16:04] <mt> thanks
[2016/02/21 04:16:06] <Tobbi> I won't.
[2016/02/21 04:17:46] <mt> do we want leafshot?
[2016/02/21 04:20:59] <mt> >_>
[2016/02/21 04:21:02] <Tobbi> mt: Technically, it's a new feature, isn't it?
[2016/02/21 04:21:11] <mt> git rebase -i doesn't show useful information
[2016/02/21 04:21:17] <mt> yes it's a new feature
[2016/02/21 04:21:32] <Tobbi> mt: However, we could take it in.
[2016/02/21 04:21:36] <Tobbi> Doesn't hurt.
[2016/02/21 04:21:37] <mt> and no way I'm going to cherry-pick every useful commit
[2016/02/21 04:21:48] <mt> I'd rather want to strip out the non-fixes
[2016/02/21 04:22:07] <Tobbi> mt: Which commit doesn't show useful information?
[2016/02/21 04:22:25] <mt> well
[2016/02/21 04:22:39] <mt> I actually fast-forwarded origin/master to release/0.4
[2016/02/21 04:22:53] <mt> now I want to rebase -i and just remove the commits we *don't* want
[2016/02/21 04:23:02] <Tobbi> mt: Sounds fine with me.
[2016/02/21 04:23:10] <mt> which is easier than looking at every commit, copying its hash and cherry-picking it
[2016/02/21 04:23:16] <Tobbi> right
[2016/02/21 04:23:32] <mt> the problem is that git-rebase-todo only includes hash and commit message
[2016/02/21 04:23:39] <Tobbi> ah...
[2016/02/21 04:24:16] <Tobbi> mt: Couldn't you git log <hash> in another console tab?
[2016/02/21 04:24:23] <Tobbi> If you want the complete commit msg.
[2016/02/21 04:24:26] <Tobbi> or something else.
[2016/02/21 04:24:28] <Tobbi> idk
[2016/02/21 04:24:34] <mt> git-show would be what I'd use
[2016/02/21 04:24:41] <mt> but then I'd do that for every commit as well
[2016/02/21 04:24:51] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/02/21 04:25:06] <Tobbi> Basically, inside git rebase you want to have the full commit msg.
[2016/02/21 04:25:16] <mt> rather a short diff
[2016/02/21 04:25:31] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2016/02/21 04:25:37] <mt> but I guess this was our problem
[2016/02/21 04:25:42] <mt> for the next release
[2016/02/21 04:25:51] <mt> we should fix changes in the release branch
[2016/02/21 04:25:59] <mt> and regularly pull that one into master
[2016/02/21 04:26:21] <Tobbi> We could do that.
[2016/02/21 04:26:35] <Tobbi> Or simply cherry-pick on both.
[2016/02/21 04:26:41] <Tobbi> eeh, you know what I mean...
[2016/02/21 04:26:42] <mt> e.g. right now
[2016/02/21 04:26:53] <mt> I don't know when particle script was introducesd
[2016/02/21 04:26:56] <mt> s/esd/ed/
[2016/02/21 04:26:56] <red_bot> mt meant: "I don't know when particle script was introduced"
[2016/02/21 04:27:06] <mt> s/script/scripting/
[2016/02/21 04:27:06] <red_bot> mt meant: "I don't know when particle scripting was introducesd"
[2016/02/21 04:27:17] <mt> red_bot: shut up
[2016/02/21 04:29:04] <mt> also
[2016/02/21 04:29:06] <Tobbi> mt: Maybe we can go through the commits in a public etherpad?
[2016/02/21 04:29:12] <mt> we have a very nice merge chaos
[2016/02/21 04:29:18] <mt> due to grumbel's develop branches
[2016/02/21 04:29:27] <mt> that've been merged into each other
[2016/02/21 04:29:34] <Tobbi> yes, that's true.
[2016/02/21 04:30:06] <Tobbi> uh oh, a lot depends on those, right?
[2016/02/21 04:30:12] <Tobbi> I mean: We'd have to backport a lot, right?
[2016/02/21 04:30:14] <mt> I don't know
[2016/02/21 04:30:43] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/02/21 04:31:21] <mt> the public etherpad idea is good tho
[2016/02/21 04:31:35] <Tobbi> Okay, let's see...
[2016/02/21 04:31:50] <mt> I can use https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/, right?
[2016/02/21 04:32:09] <Tobbi> yes.
[2016/02/21 04:32:11] <Tobbi> I guess so.
[2016/02/21 04:35:07] <Tobbi> mt: I have the output of git log here: https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/SuperTux_changes_since_0.4
[2016/02/21 04:35:39] <Tobbi> If you want git shortlog, I can do that.
[2016/02/21 04:35:47] <mt> I'll put a pad with a git-rebase-todo there
[2016/02/21 04:36:09] <Tobbi> ok.

[2016/02/21 05:11:36] <Tobbi> We're trying to decide what's a bugfix and what isn't.
[2016/02/21 05:11:50] <Hume2> OK
[2016/02/21 05:12:12] <Tobbi> It's rather difficult distinguishing the lisp parser commits from the rest.

[2016/02/21 05:13:31] <mt> /kick brmbrmspy ???
[2016/02/21 05:13:56] <mt> oh we'd also need to /kick red_spy for that to be effective

[2016/02/21 05:27:07] <brmbrmcar> What bots?
[2016/02/21 05:27:13] <mt> it's against freenode's rules to do that without asking
[2016/02/21 05:27:20] <mt> 11:22:49 -i- [OperationGT] (~brmbrmcar@unaffiliated/brmbrmcar/bot/brmbrmbot) was Ruby bot brmbrmbot
[2016/02/21 05:27:32] <brmbrmcar> Hold on...
[2016/02/21 05:27:42] <brmbrmcar> yeah
[2016/02/21 05:28:00] <brmbrmcar> it shouldn't occur
[2016/02/21 05:28:04] <brmbrmcar> I'll see logs
[2016/02/21 05:28:26] <brmbrmcar> i don't see it
[2016/02/21 05:28:39] <mt> oh and who was OperationGT then?
[2016/02/21 05:28:47] <mt> the person asking about the editor?
[2016/02/21 05:28:51] <brmbrmcar> yes
[2016/02/21 05:29:00] <brmbrmcar> He probabky logged in as my bot
[2016/02/21 05:29:08] <Tobbi> How the hell can he do that?
[2016/02/21 05:29:11] <mt> no, it's a separate account
[2016/02/21 05:30:29] <mt> brmbrmcar: and you were that OperationGT guy on the etherpad right now?
[2016/02/21 05:31:01] <brmbrmcar> no
[2016/02/21 05:31:19] <mt> now if these answer are honest
[2016/02/21 05:31:23] <mt> then this is getting interesting

[2016/02/21 05:49:19] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/02/21 05:49:20] @ OperationGT_ left channel #supertux ("Leaving")
[2016/02/21 05:50:10] <Hume2> I think that this could be a wontfix: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/362
[2016/02/21 05:50:35] <Tobbi> Not sure.
[2016/02/21 05:50:47] <mt> Hume2: I think we should release 0.4.1 when we're done pushing fixes to release/0.4
[2016/02/21 05:50:55] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2016/02/21 05:51:06] <Tobbi> mt: What about the windows issues we have? Are those fixed?
[2016/02/21 05:51:08] <Hume2> OK. I'm now trying to figure out what it is.
[2016/02/21 05:51:15] <mt> Tobbi: I don't think so
[2016/02/21 05:51:20] <mt> but I already told you
[2016/02/21 05:51:33] <mt> users affected by only the issues fixed will be happy
[2016/02/21 05:51:36] <Tobbi> mt: Sorry, Alzheimer's Disease.
[2016/02/21 05:51:41] <mt> otherwise they'd have to wait
[2016/02/21 05:51:48] <Tobbi> right.
[2016/02/21 05:51:57] <Tobbi> Actually: Frequent releases increase momentum.
[2016/02/21 05:52:02] <Tobbi> So we can certainly release 0.4.1
[2016/02/21 05:52:15] <Hume2> Tobbi: I think that that bug with tilemaps is happening because it's faster than 32px per update.
[2016/02/21 05:52:18] <mt> users having unfixed problems will have to wait anyway
[2016/02/21 05:52:22] <Tobbi> right.

[2016/02/21 07:12:51] <mt> ok
[2016/02/21 07:13:05] <mt> by the way
[2016/02/21 07:13:12] <mt> since we were speaking about licenses
[2016/02/21 07:13:22] <mt> I wonder if we could move levels to CC-BY-SA 4
[2016/02/21 07:13:48] <mt> at least new ones
[2016/02/21 07:14:46] <Tobbi> mt: Don't we need to get confirmation from the authors?
[2016/02/21 07:14:52] <Tobbi> Oh, new ones...
[2016/02/21 07:14:59] <Tobbi> Difference between 3?
[2016/02/21 07:15:11] <mt> dunno
[2016/02/21 07:15:14] <mt> just seems saner
[2016/02/21 07:15:21] <Tobbi> mt: Sure, why not.
[2016/02/21 07:15:27] <mt> as the current levels are, I think, dual licensed
[2016/02/21 07:15:30] <Tobbi> mt: Also, what's the failed diff for the first change set?
[2016/02/21 07:15:33] <mt> GPL 2+/CC-BY-SA 3
[2016/02/21 07:15:48] <mt> don't have it there
[2016/02/21 07:16:02] <Tobbi> ok.
[2016/02/21 07:16:55] <mt> you could `git checkout release/0.4 && git checkout -b release/0.4-test && git submodule update --init #required to sync them to the old version && # fix up unstaged changes without committing them && git rebase -i v0.4.0`
[2016/02/21 07:16:57] <Tobbi> mt: Yes, that one changeset needs to be dropped. It has a ReaderMapping&...
[2016/02/21 07:17:12] <Tobbi> d190b35 Marked TileSetParser::parse_tile_images() as const
[2016/02/21 07:18:02] <Tobbi> Okay, I'll look at the failed changes in more detail.

[2016/02/21 07:20:33] <Tobbi> Yeah...
[2016/02/21 07:20:43] <Tobbi> mt: Yeah, just making sure that it doesn't interfere...
[2016/02/21 07:21:24] <mt> we'd need to fix up the conflicts
[2016/02/21 07:21:36] <mt> look at the command I've provided if you want to look into it

[2016/02/21 07:36:38] <mt> Indeed, why can't we ask them to ask their legal department
[2016/02/21 07:36:47] <mt> that shouldn't be a problem for them, really
[2016/02/21 07:36:48] <Tobbi> We definitely could.
[2016/02/21 07:37:06] <Tobbi> However, we don't have an email address.
[2016/02/21 07:37:19] <mt> They can forward that internally
[2016/02/21 07:37:30] <mt> And I think that would actually be the better solution
[2016/02/21 07:37:40] <Tobbi> Alright, let's do it.
[2016/02/21 07:37:48] <mt> Since I don't know if these Software Law Center lawyers know about German law
[2016/02/21 07:38:05] <mt> and especially German and US copyright law is *really* different
[2016/02/21 07:38:47] <mt> we don't have copyright, public domain or fair use; we might have things that are similar but pretty different
[2016/02/21 07:39:24] <Tobbi> I don't know how to draft an e-mail to them...
[2016/02/21 07:39:26] <Tobbi> I'll try.
[2016/02/21 07:39:34] <mt> to whom now
[2016/02/21 07:39:48] @ Quit: lumidify: Ping timeout: 276 seconds
[2016/02/21 07:40:03] <Tobbi> mt: To the MDR-Rechtsabteilung.
[2016/02/21 07:40:39] <mt> To this employeed, I'd just ask: 'Due to the different legal nature of open source software, and us not having resources for legal assistance, could we talk about this to your legal department'
[2016/02/21 07:40:42] <mt> or something similar
[2016/02/21 07:42:11] <Tobbi> Hmm, yeah, I can do that...
[2016/02/21 07:42:38] <Tobbi> I think by now she's wondering what she's gotten herself into :D

[2016/02/21 07:58:31] <Hume2> OK, mt, Is it now OK to push commits to master?
[2016/02/21 07:58:41] <mt> I think it works, actually
[2016/02/21 07:58:47] <Hume2> Thanks for info.
[2016/02/21 07:58:55] <mt> if it's a fix we'd just have to rebase again, now only adding one commit
[2016/02/21 07:59:51] <Hume2> It could be even rebased a bit later. For now, a part of 302 commits should be rebased.
[2016/02/21 07:59:53] <Tobbi> mt: Rebasing worked?
[2016/02/21 08:01:40] <mt> no?

[2016/02/21 10:54:12] <Hume2> INT_MAX is the maximum value of int. It doesn't have to be defined AFAIK.

[2016/02/21 10:54:43] <Hume2> I'd put there a sane number instead.

[2016/02/21 10:55:26] <Hume2> It's closest to INT_MAX, that seems sane enough.
[2016/02/21 10:55:49] <mt> "doesn't have to be defined"
[2016/02/21 10:55:53] <mt> well it has to be
[2016/02/21 10:56:03] <mt> at least by the compiler
[2016/02/21 10:56:22] <Hume2> Maybe, but still, I'd put there a sane number instead.

[2016/02/21 11:01:16] <mt> why don't we leave it?
[2016/02/21 11:01:26] <mt> 45 lives is enough, isn't it?
[2016/02/21 11:01:30] <mt> well, 44
[2016/02/21 11:01:32] <Hume2> 2 953 633 coins = 99 lives
[2016/02/21 11:02:01] <Hume2> It should be enough, but what about the shop?
[2016/02/21 11:02:12] <Hume2> How much should the items cost?

[2016/02/21 12:15:14] <mt> what are grumbel's changes actually for
[2016/02/21 12:15:19] <Tobbi> mt: Lisp parsing.
[2016/02/21 12:15:26] <mt> is that a new feature?
[2016/02/21 12:15:35] <mt> if not, it can be considered performance fix
[2016/02/21 12:15:35] <Tobbi> mt: It is a new parser.
[2016/02/21 12:15:38] <Tobbi> And a bigger change.
[2016/02/21 12:15:52] <Hume2> I don't know, but whole development since 0.4.0 depends on it.
[2016/02/21 12:16:04] <Tobbi> We could as well get that in...
[2016/02/21 12:16:07] <Tobbi> Seems to be stable.
[2016/02/21 12:16:13] <Tobbi> BUt, still...bigger project.
[2016/02/21 12:16:18] <mt> why does everything depend on it

[2016/02/21 12:17:37] <Hume2> Mainly yes, but it differs in the SectorParser etc. very much.
[2016/02/21 12:18:25] <mt> I wonder how many conflicts there actually are
[2016/02/21 12:19:05] <Hume2> I'd add it to 0.4.1 as well. At least we'll get what all bugs are in that.

[2016/02/21 12:25:42] <Tobbi> For next year.
[2016/02/21 12:25:51] <Tobbi> We just need someone to pay for travel and accomodation.
[2016/02/21 12:26:21] <mt> maybe ask debian or redhat
[2016/02/21 12:26:32] <mt> possibly they have special funds for such purposes
[2016/02/21 12:27:12] <Tobbi> I am not sure.
[2016/02/21 12:27:22] <Tobbi> Does anyone want to manage the booth?
[2016/02/21 12:27:57] <Tobbi> I'd not want to do this alone.
[2016/02/21 12:28:31] <mt> otoh why FOSDEM?
[2016/02/21 12:28:46] <Tobbi> mt: Why not?
[2016/02/21 12:28:56] <Tobbi> It's the biggest event here in Europe, isn't it?
[2016/02/21 12:29:53] <Hume2> Hmmm, that hated city...
[2016/02/21 12:30:28] <mt> we're already known enough in the open source community, I guess
[2016/02/21 12:30:44] <mt> why not some actual game conferences?
[2016/02/21 12:30:53] <Hume2> Anyway I'm not riding there.

[2016/02/21 12:32:48] <Tobbi> mt: That's expensive.
[2016/02/21 12:32:52] <Tobbi> We couldn't afford that.

[2016/02/21 12:33:47] <mt> we should sell SuperTux on Steam
[2016/02/21 12:34:00] <mt> maybe get some better name for it
[2016/02/21 12:34:10] <Hume2> :D Seriously?
[2016/02/21 12:34:22] <mt> Hume2: why not?
[2016/02/21 12:34:45] <Hume2> Because we aren't moneyvorous.
[2016/02/21 12:34:58] <Tobbi> not yet.
[2016/02/21 12:35:02] <Tobbi> But money rules the world.
[2016/02/21 12:35:38] <Hume2> Can't you get a normal job?
[2016/02/21 12:35:56] <Tobbi> No.
[2016/02/21 12:36:16] <Hume2> Selling an open source game is really...
[2016/02/21 12:36:47] <Tobbi> We wouldn't have a financial home anyway.
[2016/02/21 12:37:05] <Tobbi> And I wouldn't want to be the owner of the SuperTux bank account...
[2016/02/21 12:37:23] <mt> Hume2: it's actually allowed
[2016/02/21 12:37:36] <Hume2> I know, but still... :D
[2016/02/21 12:37:46] <mt> and people can still use git
[2016/02/21 12:37:58] <Hume2> I think so.
[2016/02/21 12:37:58] <mt> but no moar binaries
[2016/02/21 12:38:51] <Tobbi> selling SuperTux...hrm.
[2016/02/21 12:38:57] <Hume2> I just know one think about selling games:
[2016/02/21 12:38:57] <Tobbi> We don't actually have any need for money.
[2016/02/21 12:39:01] <Tobbi> Other than attending conferences.
[2016/02/21 12:39:25] <mt> if we have too much of it we can still donate it
[2016/02/21 12:39:37] <Hume2> Game consts money? if (is_crack_available) { download_cracked(); } else { choose_another_game(); }
[2016/02/21 12:39:37] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/02/21 12:39:45] <Tobbi> Donate it to me? :P
[2016/02/21 12:39:54] <Hume2> *costs

[2016/02/21 12:40:31] <Tobbi> mt: Exactly! :)
[2016/02/21 12:40:32] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/21 12:40:36] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/21 12:42:46] <Hume2> Narre made today another level for his WIP addon, I thought that he won't make any today.
[2016/02/21 12:43:07] <Hume2> And he managed to not make a merge commit :D
[2016/02/21 12:45:01] <Hume2> I know that two WIP addons in one git repository is a crap, but at least he'll learng git.
[2016/02/21 12:45:30] <Tobbi> Hume2: Is it available somewhere?
[2016/02/21 12:45:42] <Hume2> https://github.com/Cecflit/levels
[2016/02/21 12:46:05] <Tobbi> Oh, let's see...
[2016/02/21 12:46:46] <Hume2> It looks like Narre has never seen a canyon :P)
[2016/02/21 12:47:34] <Tobbi> I tried running canyonpattern.stl.
[2016/02/21 12:47:35] <Tobbi> fail.
[2016/02/21 12:47:49] <Hume2> He uses his own resources.
[2016/02/21 12:50:15] <Tobbi> The levels are "okay"
[2016/02/21 12:50:34] <Hume2> How do you mean "okay"?
[2016/02/21 12:50:51] <Tobbi> Hume2: Design-wise they're good.
[2016/02/21 12:50:59] <Tobbi> Just not very special. :P
[2016/02/21 12:51:12] <Tobbi> Actually, I only tried one level so far.
[2016/02/21 12:51:25] <Hume2> You know, he's going to make 400 levels for his addon.
[2016/02/21 12:52:03] <Hume2> We are now realistic about level making.
[2016/02/21 12:53:09] <Hume2> Yeah, my addon will contain only 73 levels.
[2016/02/21 12:53:56] <Hume2> I made a level where the signs show the longest possible way :P

[2016/02/21 12:56:51] <Tobbi> wow.
[2016/02/21 12:57:03] <Tobbi> 400 levels?
[2016/02/21 12:57:06] <mt> why doesn't he use your magic software to create the levels?
[2016/02/21 12:57:06] <Tobbi> Why not make good ones.
[2016/02/21 12:59:17] <Hume2> It's because our fantasy is limited.
[2016/02/21 12:59:24] <Tobbi>   hmm...
[2016/02/21 12:59:26] <Tobbi> I know that feeling.
[2016/02/21 13:00:46] <Hume2> Narre says that it's better to make the level first and then think it a name.
[2016/02/21 13:01:22] <Hume2> I say that when it's a name that can be any level, it can be thought even before.
[2016/02/21 13:02:58] <Hume2> Narre uses my thingy, but only limited to create tile backgrounds.
[2016/02/21 13:03:38] <Hume2> I use it the same way for ma addon. TeraTux Reborn deserves to be a separate thing.
[2016/02/21 13:03:53] <Hume2> s/ma/my/
[2016/02/21 13:03:53] <red_bot> Hume2 meant: "I use it the same way for my addon. TeraTux Reborn deserves to be a separate thing."
[2016/02/21 13:05:32] <mt> no we're gonna include it in the main game

[2016/02/21 13:16:11] <Hume2> Thanks, Tobbi :)
[2016/02/21 13:16:35] <Hume2> The levels we were making before were really crappy.
[2016/02/21 13:16:50] <Hume2> You know, Hume's Islands and Narreland.
[2016/02/21 13:17:44] <Hume2> Hume's Rainbow Cave is far better, but still they could be better.
[2016/02/21 13:19:41] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yes. I wonder whether it has something to do with missing graphics.
[2016/02/21 13:19:44] <mt> just follow grumbel's styleguide
[2016/02/21 13:19:54] <mt> that results in nice levels
[2016/02/21 13:20:21] <Hume2> I think that it's not all though.
[2016/02/21 13:20:40] <Hume2> Actually, I don't know.
[2016/02/21 13:21:03] <Hume2> Tobbi: What missing graphics?
[2016/02/21 13:21:24] <Tobbi> Hume2: I wonder whether we need to add more graphics in order for people to be able to create quality levels.
[2016/02/21 13:21:39] <mt> grumbel says we should fix the code
[2016/02/21 13:21:41] <mt> first
[2016/02/21 13:21:47] <Hume2> Tobbi: I don't think so.
[2016/02/21 13:21:50] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/02/21 13:22:08] <Tobbi> mt: What code?
[2016/02/21 13:22:08] <Hume2> Tobbi: See that Overunderground.
[2016/02/21 13:22:14] <Tobbi> okay, let me check.
[2016/02/21 13:22:17] <mt> wtf is Overunderground
[2016/02/21 13:22:18] <Hume2> I use only implemented graphics.
[2016/02/21 13:22:52] <Hume2> In the center you'll have to defeat the Overunderground Tower after collecting four keys.
[2016/02/21 13:23:24] <Tobbi> Hume2: Can you make an add-on out of Narre's latest master?
[2016/02/21 13:23:30] <Tobbi> for me to try out?
[2016/02/21 13:23:47] <Hume2> Tobbi: Clone the repository into ./supertux2
[2016/02/21 13:23:54] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2016/02/21 13:24:03] <Tobbi> I don't want to mess with my profile.
[2016/02/21 13:24:13] <Hume2> Therefore you'll have it in the folder .supertux2/levels/narre2
[2016/02/21 13:24:57] <Hume2> I use it like this.
[2016/02/21 13:25:14] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/02/21 13:26:17] <Hume2> After that you can launch the levels directly from SuperTux.

[2016/02/21 13:28:28] <Hume2> Kind of.
[2016/02/21 13:28:36] <Tobbi> works.

[2016/02/21 13:31:50] <Tobbi> uhm...when did I merge this? How long did this build take?
[2016/02/21 13:32:11] <Hume2> AppVeyor seems to be slower.
[2016/02/21 13:33:53] <Tobbi> Guys, for levels that don't have a countdown timer, do we want a countup timer?
[2016/02/21 13:33:59] <Tobbi> Something that displays your current time at the top?
[2016/02/21 13:34:47] <Hume2> I don't know, it might be frusturating for some people.
[2016/02/21 13:35:54] <Tobbi> We could have a setting.
[2016/02/21 13:36:05] <Hume2> Yeah.
[2016/02/21 13:36:38] <Hume2> And we need to centralize the leveltime.
[2016/02/21 13:37:00] <Hume2> Because the leveltime is a sector object, not a global property.
[2016/02/21 13:37:25] <Hume2> That way, you can have another leveltime in each sector.

[2016/02/22 12:25:30] <Tobbi> Hello Hume2.
[2016/02/22 12:30:42] <Hume2> So we need:
[2016/02/22 12:30:55] <Hume2> 3 forest levels and 7 dark forest levels.
[2016/02/22 12:31:39] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/22 12:33:16] <mt> why specifically?
[2016/02/22 12:34:45] <mt> key?.stl are the actual keys?
[2016/02/22 12:34:58] <mt> or some leftover?
[2016/02/22 12:35:26] <mt> also, do you have a screenshot of the reorganized worldmap?
[2016/02/22 12:46:28] <Hume2> mt: http://i.imgur.com/povg4dc.png
[2016/02/22 12:46:58] <Hume2> key[n].stl were just example usages of keys.
[2016/02/22 12:47:08] <Hume2> They were not actual levels.
[2016/02/22 12:50:49] @ Quit: tuxdev_: Ping timeout: 255 seconds
[2016/02/22 12:55:03] <Tobbi> I'm still playing Narre's levels...
[2016/02/22 12:55:34] <Tobbi> I think you should improve the layout, still.
[2016/02/22 12:55:44] <Tobbi> Add more elements, make them more pleasing.
[2016/02/22 12:55:47] <Tobbi> Or rather, he should.
[2016/02/22 12:55:59] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I still haven't beat the first level.
[2016/02/22 12:56:05] <sydney_untangle> Thanks Hume2. :p
[2016/02/22 12:56:31] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Uh, hume is narre, right?
[2016/02/22 12:56:44] <Hume2> No, I'm not Narre.
[2016/02/22 12:57:20] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: No, he isn't.
[2016/02/22 12:57:24] <Tobbi> Narre is Hume2's friend.
[2016/02/22 12:58:38] <Hume2> And Narreland is not Narre's Multiworld.
[2016/02/22 12:59:45] <Tobbi> I'm at level 33 / 49.
[2016/02/22 13:00:27] <Hume2> The level number is not final though. He's going to fill levels in-middle.
[2016/02/22 13:00:35] <Tobbi> Hopefully.
[2016/02/22 13:00:41] <Tobbi> And hopefully good ones.
[2016/02/22 13:00:42] <sydney_untangle> Hume2: Ah, well, say hi to your friend for me. ;)
[2016/02/22 13:01:02] <Hume2> sydney_untangle: Will do.
[2016/02/22 13:01:09] <Hume2> :)
[2016/02/22 13:04:55] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/22 13:06:54] <mt> why isn't he on IRC as often as you are?
[2016/02/22 13:07:08] <Hume2> mt: He's very shy.
[2016/02/22 13:07:52] <Hume2> I tell him that he doesn't have to care about grammar, but still.
[2016/02/22 13:08:39] <Hume2> And please don't thell him that I've told you something about him, he could ragequit.
[2016/02/22 13:09:20] <mt> There's that log, you know?
[2016/02/22 13:09:43] <Hume2> mt: I know, but Narre doesn't specate it :P
[2016/02/22 13:09:55] <mt> ok
[2016/02/22 13:10:47] <Hume2> ~seen Narre
[2016/02/22 13:10:47] <red_bot> Hume2: Narre was last seen 22 days, 18 minutes and 4 seconds ago, quitting IRC (Quit: Page closed) and a while before saying "So I know variables, methods, classes. But that's all. I don't even know how to use arrays and other things." in #supertux
[2016/02/22 13:11:20] <Hume2> As I expected.
[2016/02/22 13:11:52] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/02/22 13:12:21] <Tobbi> Hume2: Tell him I don't know anything about computers
[2016/02/22 13:12:25] <Tobbi> Might cheer him up.
[2016/02/22 13:12:35] <Hume2> OK, will do.
[2016/02/22 13:12:39] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/22 13:14:44] <Tobbi> mt: I haven't heard back from MDR. Not sure if they forwarded that mail or not...
[2016/02/22 13:15:05] <Tobbi> But regarding SFLC, I had to reply "I understand", so I should be in their queue.
[2016/02/22 13:15:26] <Hume2> I've once tried to learn Narre the Squirel and he hoped that he'd learn programming in school :P
[2016/02/22 13:15:52] <Tobbi> Squirrel is a weird language.
[2016/02/22 13:15:56] <Tobbi> I don't know it.
[2016/02/22 13:16:06] <Tobbi> Actually, I probably know the basics...
[2016/02/22 13:16:09] <Tobbi> but still...
[2016/02/22 13:16:10] <Hume2> Now it's obvious that the highschool isn't capable to learn programming :D
[2016/02/22 13:16:19] <Tobbi> Hume2: You mean teach?
[2016/02/22 13:16:24] <Hume2> Yeah.
[2016/02/22 13:16:33] <Tobbi> Hume2: We learned Delphi in school.
[2016/02/22 13:16:40] <Tobbi> Or should I say, I was one of the few who did.
[2016/02/22 13:16:50] <Hume2> We haven't learned any so far.
[2016/02/22 13:16:53] <lumidify> That's why there's this: https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science
[2016/02/22 13:17:19] <Hume2> Narre's highschool: first half of years they teached Java.
[2016/02/22 13:17:53] <Hume2> Just a few students got what's the difference between int and string :P
[2016/02/22 13:18:07] <Hume2> Now they teach PHP.
[2016/02/22 13:18:18] <Tobbi> PHP is ugly.
[2016/02/22 13:18:21] <Tobbi> I don't touch that.
[2016/02/22 13:18:38] <Hume2> I don't know PHP much.
[2016/02/22 13:18:52] <lumidify> Go Python!
[2016/02/22 13:18:58] <Tobbi> Python is nice.
[2016/02/22 13:20:54] <Hume2> What do you thing? Should programming should be teached in basic school?
[2016/02/22 13:22:00] <Tobbi> Hume2: *taught (check your irregular verbs) and, I am not sure
[2016/02/22 13:22:08] <Tobbi> It's not that useful.
[2016/02/22 13:22:19] <Tobbi> Unless you want to pursue a career in computer science,
[2016/02/22 13:22:33] <mt> "not that useful"
[2016/02/22 13:22:51] <mt> school's for teaching students stuff to know what's going on in their lives
[2016/02/22 13:23:02] <Tobbi> mt: C'mon... It's not necessary to live a happy life.
[2016/02/22 13:23:03] <mt> else people who want to write books wouldn't need maths
[2016/02/22 13:23:18] <mt> people who want to pursue a career in science might not need languages
[2016/02/22 13:23:43] <Tobbi> They might need English though.
[2016/02/22 13:23:49] <Tobbi> Most papers are written in English.
[2016/02/22 13:23:59] <Hume2> I know that it might be mad, but it could partially prevent those people-logic errors.
[2016/02/22 13:24:16] <Hume2> Well, not really.
[2016/02/22 13:24:47] <Hume2> They'd teach it a weird way, so it would have no effect in many cases.
[2016/02/22 13:27:23] <Tobbi> Indeed.
[2016/02/22 13:27:56] <Tobbi> Hume2: I have gone through extensive lessons regarding computer science, and you can tell I don't know anything about computers...So, there: Fault of the German highschool / college system.
[2016/02/22 13:28:31] <Hume2> Tobbi: You know, computer knowledge != programming skills
[2016/02/22 13:28:46] <Tobbi> That's true.
[2016/02/22 13:30:13] <Hume2> You know, the people-logic errors, they are so annying.
[2016/02/22 13:30:41] <Hume2> *annoying
[2016/02/22 13:31:16] <mt> what do you consider "people-logic errors"?
[2016/02/22 13:32:02] <Hume2> mt: You know, when someone hat two or more opinions at once.
[2016/02/22 13:32:20] <mt> opinions that conflict?
[2016/02/22 13:32:31] <Hume2> Like very different opinions, those are in conflict.
[2016/02/22 13:32:40] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/22 13:33:14] <Hume2> Well, those people usually don't know that they have two opinions at once.
[2016/02/22 13:34:22] <Tobbi> Hume2: Programming can't help there.
[2016/02/22 13:34:35] <Tobbi> Programming is just an excercise. Also, people either know how to do it or they don't.
[2016/02/22 13:34:46] <Hume2> That's true.
[2016/02/22 13:35:03] <mt> Logical thinking can be learned
[2016/02/22 13:35:18] <Tobbi> mt: It's not about logic. It's about abstract thinking.
[2016/02/22 13:35:23] <mt> Yes
[2016/02/22 13:35:26] <Tobbi> Also, there was a paper published...
[2016/02/22 13:35:45] <Tobbi> This: http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf
[2016/02/22 13:35:50] <mt> Many people seem to think they can get through maths/physics/computer science without knowing that :/
[2016/02/22 13:36:00] <Tobbi> Oh, it's the 10 year anniversary of that paper today.
[2016/02/22 13:36:20] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/22 13:36:56] <Hume2> The people-logic error could be also something a bit different.
[2016/02/22 13:37:18] <Hume2> Once I've asked how to get somewhere.
[2016/02/22 13:37:20] <Tobbi> Hume2: Even though I am a fairly good programmer, I am still indecisive in some areas.
[2016/02/22 13:37:31] <Hume2> ikr
[2016/02/22 13:38:09] <Hume2> He said that I'll ride two stations by bus 183 and while I'm riding the bus 125...
[2016/02/22 13:38:31] <Hume2> See?
[2016/02/22 13:38:41] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: You are going to contact some lawyers?
[2016/02/22 13:38:51] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I already did. SFLC
[2016/02/22 13:39:10] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I had to confirm that there is no confidential information in the request.
[2016/02/22 13:39:20] <Tobbi> Besides, haven't heard back from them.
[2016/02/22 13:42:45] <Hume2> Tobbi: That paper is interresting.
[2016/02/22 13:43:08] <Tobbi> told ya.
[2016/02/22 13:46:54] <sydney_untangle> Hrm.
[2016/02/22 13:48:35] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: The MDR haven't replied back to me, though.
[2016/02/22 13:48:43] <Tobbi> The TV station this originated from.

[2016/02/23 13:42:09] <Tobbi> ZNC quit?
[2016/02/23 13:43:07] <mt> because you sent SIGTERM or told it to quit?
[2016/02/23 13:43:56] <mt> iirc if it'd segfault it tries to gracefully disconnect from IRC and includes the reason in the quit message
[2016/02/23 13:44:09] <Tobbi> mt: I didn't.
[2016/02/23 13:44:20] <Tobbi> ... do either.
[2016/02/23 13:44:51] <mt> what does your log say?
[2016/02/23 13:45:17] <Tobbi> I'll check.

[2016/02/23 13:47:07] <mt> pretty strange
[2016/02/23 13:47:26] <Tobbi> mt: Where can I find the logs?
[2016/02/23 13:47:38] <mt> I just realized ZNC doesn't log
[2016/02/23 13:48:00] <Tobbi> mt: My Fritz.Box restarted itself.

[2016/02/23 17:37:51] <Some_Person> I need to try this game again, it's been years since I've played it or kept up with anything going on
[2016/02/23 17:38:15] <Tobbi> Some_Person: SuperTux has improved a lot over "a few years ago"
[2016/02/23 17:38:33] <Some_Person> I wonder if any of the crappy sound effects I made are still in it :P
[2016/02/23 17:38:50] <Tobbi> Some_Person: Which ones?
[2016/02/23 17:38:54] * Tobbi checks
[2016/02/23 17:39:29] <Tobbi> Some_Person: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/AUTHORS still lists your name in a couple places.
[2016/02/23 17:39:39] <Tobbi> however, feel free to create better ones if you feel up to it.
[2016/02/23 17:41:04] <Some_Person> nice to see that y'all are using github now :)
[2016/02/23 17:41:28] <Some_Person> it was all svn last time I was here
[2016/02/23 17:41:31] <Tobbi> Some_Person: We were forced to use github because of the google code shutdown
[2016/02/23 17:41:35] <Tobbi> But I am glad about it as well.
[2016/02/23 17:41:43] <Tobbi> It's gotten much better to manage everything.
[2016/02/23 17:43:07] <Tobbi> Plus, much better exposure to the rest of the open source world.
[2016/02/23 17:46:08] <Some_Person> it does look like there's been a lot of development. I'm glad to see it :)
[2016/02/23 17:46:24] <Tobbi> Some_Person: Have you tried out 0.4.0? You should :)
[2016/02/23 17:46:49] <Some_Person> I think I'll have to tonight!
[2016/02/23 17:46:56] <Tobbi> Sounds good.
[2016/02/23 17:47:12] <Tobbi> Some_Person: In case you want to get in the loop again: We could always use contributors.
[2016/02/23 17:48:09] <Some_Person> Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of free time these days (working full time and close to getting my degree; pretty sure I was in high school the last time I was here), but I won't say never
[2016/02/23 17:49:25] <Tobbi> Some_Person: Sounds fun.
[2016/02/23 17:53:26] <Some_Person> there's a lot of questions I feel like asking, but it'll be easier if I just wait to play the thing (I'm actually still at work right now)
[2016/02/23 17:53:59] <Tobbi> Some_Person: I am also in college so I know how you feel.
[2016/02/23 17:54:52] <Some_Person> Oh nice, 0.4.0 is actually considered stable
[2016/02/23 17:55:21] <Tobbi> Some_Person: The worst mistake we ever did.
[2016/02/23 17:55:28] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/23 17:56:06] <Some_Person> To be honest, it always seemed pretty damn stable to me
[2016/02/23 17:56:27] <Tobbi> Some_Person: To me as well...
[2016/02/23 17:56:31] <Tobbi> But some people were having problems.
[2016/02/23 17:56:44] <Tobbi> Some_Person: My main reason for doing a release was to just get this thing on the road.
[2016/02/23 17:56:54] <Tobbi> It's been a long time since the last stable.
[2016/02/23 17:57:13] <Some_Person> I hear ya. I remember when I was advocating strongly just for the 0.3.4 development release
[2016/02/23 17:57:39] <Tobbi> Oh, that's also been some time.

[2016/02/24 08:31:13] <Tobbi> Woo, 41 minutes with a Microsoft scammer.
[2016/02/24 08:31:17] <Tobbi> Can anyone do better?
[2016/02/24 08:49:06] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: :p
[2016/02/24 08:49:14] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: 3 hours upgrading windows? :p

[2016/02/24 09:24:44] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: huh? Upgrading windows?
[2016/02/24 09:25:21] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: The thing is: I stopped before he could gain access, because I wasn't sure whether the VM I have been doing this in was safe.
[2016/02/24 09:25:49] <Tobbi> But, it was probably safe.
[2016/02/24 09:26:07] <Tobbi> I mean: Safe from the rest of my computer.
[2016/02/24 09:26:32] <mt> what's these microsoft scamming all about? are windows users really such idiots to let others access their computers?
[2016/02/24 09:26:59] <Tobbi> mt: The thing is: You could assume that anyone speaking enough English to talk with them would be knowledgeable enough.
[2016/02/24 09:27:55] <Tobbi> But, he was on the verge of disconnecting me anyway. So, he said "He had to talk to other people as well"...
[2016/02/24 09:28:05] <Tobbi> So, I blew it, and said "Well, the thing is: I know this is a scam" :P
[2016/02/24 09:29:02] <Tobbi> mt: But, there really have to be enough people who fall for it, given it's still going strong.

[2016/02/24 09:33:38] <Tobbi> Also, I thought these idiots would have learned to take me off their calling list by now.
[2016/02/24 09:33:50] <Tobbi> But apparently not.
[2016/02/24 09:34:02] * leyyin calls Tobbi 
[2016/02/24 09:34:13] <mt> you should totally scam the scammers
[2016/02/24 09:34:21] <Tobbi> leyyin: Calling about microsoft scammers...
[2016/02/24 09:34:30] <Tobbi> I managed to keep the call going for 45 minutes straight.
[2016/02/24 09:34:54] <Tobbi> mt: I did, by not following the instructions...And I will go even further once I know my VM is safe and they cannot delete any important files.
[2016/02/24 09:35:49] <Tobbi> It looks safe from the outside (it is not linked to any microsoft account, does not have access to shared files, etc.)
[2016/02/24 09:36:04] <Tobbi> Also, chit-chatting also helps making the call longer.
[2016/02/24 09:36:17] <Tobbi> This guy seriously told me he sang in a band, as a soprano :D
[2016/02/24 09:36:23] <leyyin> :D
[2016/02/24 09:36:29] <leyyin> you enjoy life Tobbi
[2016/02/24 09:36:42] <Tobbi> leyyin: I enjoy making other people's lives miserable.
[2016/02/24 09:36:55] <leyyin> you should create a youtube channel with those recordings
[2016/02/24 09:37:06] <Tobbi> leyyin: There's TheHoaxHotel already.
[2016/02/24 09:37:10] <Tobbi> Also, I don't like my voice.
[2016/02/24 09:37:21] <leyyin> you could make $
[2016/02/24 09:37:25] <Tobbi> Also, how do I record an actual phone?
[2016/02/24 09:37:32] <Tobbi> It's not VoIP
[2016/02/24 09:37:34] <leyyin> sanity app, etc
[2016/02/24 09:37:36] <leyyin> there are apps
[2016/02/24 09:37:38] <leyyin> on the phone
[2016/02/24 09:37:43] <Tobbi> leyyin: Landline phone.
[2016/02/24 09:37:45] <Tobbi> Not smartphone
[2016/02/24 09:37:56] <leyyin> you have a landline?
[2016/02/24 09:38:00] <Tobbi> leyyin: Sure I do.
[2016/02/24 09:38:11] <leyyin> https://i.lvme.me/kiafu9t.jpg
[2016/02/24 09:38:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: huh? Landline numbers are common...
[2016/02/24 09:38:39] <Tobbi> They don't call my smartphone.
[2016/02/24 09:38:49] <leyyin> I do not think landlines are common
[2016/02/24 09:39:02] <Tobbi> mt: Tell him otherwise.
[2016/02/24 09:39:07] <leyyin> not in Romania at least
[2016/02/24 09:39:18] <leyyin> I do not know of any business with a landline
[2016/02/24 09:39:21] <leyyin> all have mobile numbers
[2016/02/24 09:39:25] <Tobbi> I see...
[2016/02/24 09:39:36] <leyyin> do you have friends with a landline?
[2016/02/24 09:39:40] <leyyin> I have none...
[2016/02/24 09:39:44] <Tobbi> leyyin: I don't have any friends.
[2016/02/24 09:39:48] <leyyin> right
[2016/02/24 09:39:53] <leyyin> forever alone Tobbi
[2016/02/24 09:40:10] <sydney_untangle> You guys, really?
[2016/02/24 09:40:11] <Tobbi> leyyin: Anyway, what I really want is for them to take me off their list. But apparently wasting their time is not enough.
[2016/02/24 09:40:16] <Tobbi> I thought it would be.
[2016/02/24 09:40:31] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, I am not a guy
[2016/02/24 09:41:10] <Tobbi> Also, they're getting smarter: They remember my name once I said it.
[2016/02/24 09:41:12] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/24 09:41:40] <leyyin> progress
[2016/02/24 09:42:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: But I should actually check my VM.
[2016/02/24 09:42:16] <Tobbi> Whether it's safe.
[2016/02/24 09:42:20] <Tobbi> And then, I'll troll them.
[2016/02/24 09:42:25] <Tobbi> They can do whatever they want with that VM.
[2016/02/24 09:42:53] <Tobbi> Anyway https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnNlJNSRxa3PF8XrKHOEPug
[2016/02/24 09:43:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: ^^
[2016/02/24 09:43:38] <leyyin> look, Tobbi has a youtube channel
[2016/02/24 09:43:42] <Tobbi> Not mine.
[2016/02/24 09:44:08] <mt> leyyin: well, in Germany, I don't know anyone without a landline phone
[2016/02/24 09:44:42] <leyyin> that is very weird
[2016/02/24 09:44:48] <leyyin> only old people have landlines here
[2016/02/24 09:44:54] <leyyin> *very old
[2016/02/24 09:45:20] <mt> we even still have these public telephone thing
[2016/02/24 09:45:30] <leyyin> :O
[2016/02/24 09:45:33] <Tobbi> phone boxes
[2016/02/24 09:45:34] <mt> where you insert coins to call somebody
[2016/02/24 09:47:38] <mt> Additionally, in larger companies, they even have internal phone system
[2016/02/24 09:47:40] <mt> s
[2016/02/24 09:47:55] <mt> And often infrastructure just for that

[2016/02/24 09:56:17] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/24 10:32:37] <sydney_untangle> Also, almost nobody has a landline over here, we are one of the oddballs with one yet. ;)
[2016/02/24 10:33:33] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I guess Germany is just behind... but how else do people get called? Mobile?
[2016/02/24 10:33:52] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Yes, everyone in america has a mobile phone now...
[2016/02/24 10:33:58] <Tobbi> gosh
[2016/02/24 10:34:14] * sydney_untangle nods...
[2016/02/24 10:36:01] <leyyin> Tobbi, Romania > Germany
[2016/02/24 10:36:13] <Tobbi> leyyin: Depends.
[2016/02/24 10:36:15] <Tobbi> I'd say no.
[2016/02/24 10:36:43] <Tobbi> On the other hand, you did say you had fast broadband, right?
[2016/02/24 10:36:46] <Tobbi> *fast and cheap
[2016/02/24 10:37:01] <leyyin> the fastest and cheapest in the world
[2016/02/24 10:37:09] <Tobbi> hrm...okay.
[2016/02/24 10:37:14] <leyyin> and not stupid internet laws
[2016/02/24 10:37:46] <Tobbi> leyyin: Problem with German internet is that it needs to be failsafe... You know, German quality products...? So, in case internet goes wrong, we need to resort to that pidgin protocol.
[2016/02/24 10:37:58] <Tobbi> That's what makes it more expensive.
[2016/02/24 10:38:31] <Tobbi> Pidgins need love too.
[2016/02/24 10:38:53] <leyyin> This video is not available in your country
[2016/02/24 10:39:01] <leyyin> *goes to piratebay*
[2016/02/24 10:39:07] <sydney_untangle> o_O
[2016/02/24 10:39:10] <leyyin> *police knocks on your door*
[2016/02/24 10:39:12] <leyyin> what the....
[2016/02/24 10:39:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: you mean: This video is not avia-lable... :P
[2016/02/24 10:39:24] <Tobbi> Meaning: pidgins can't carry that package.
[2016/02/24 10:39:29] <leyyin> how can I obtain that legally?
[2016/02/24 10:39:30] <leyyin> you can't
[2016/02/24 10:39:31] <leyyin> sigh
[2016/02/24 10:39:39] <Tobbi> leyyin: What video?
[2016/02/24 10:39:56] <leyyin> idk, just thinking of media you can't legally buy in germany
[2016/02/24 10:39:59] <leyyin> I am sure there is
[2016/02/24 10:40:04] <leyyin> but you can't pirate it either
[2016/02/24 10:40:05] <leyyin> cuz cops
[2016/02/24 10:40:37] <Tobbi> leyyin: You can't legally buy pot "media".
[2016/02/24 10:40:39] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/24 10:40:47] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: You should try it and see if any cops show up. ;p
[2016/02/24 10:41:12] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, they would have to arrest the whole population here
[2016/02/24 10:41:21] <sydney_untangle> I doubt they would have much success with many people in america, since almost everyone rips stuff off youtube and such illegally.
[2016/02/24 10:41:24] <leyyin> even the cops would have to arrest themselfs
[2016/02/24 10:41:26] <sydney_untangle> :_)
[2016/02/24 10:41:33] <Tobbi> leyyin: *sigh*
[2016/02/24 10:41:41] <Tobbi> I don't do anything illegal...except...
[2016/02/24 10:41:45] <Tobbi> well, maybe I do.
[2016/02/24 10:41:45] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/24 10:42:03] <leyyin> Tobbi, if your shit is harder to get it ilegally than legally, I wonder what path I choose....
[2016/02/24 10:42:12] <sydney_untangle> I rip videos off youtube, but thats about it.
[2016/02/24 10:42:13] <leyyin> the reverse :P
[2016/02/24 10:42:28] <Tobbi> leyyin: My shit cannot be considered an illegal drug.
[2016/02/24 10:42:35] <sydney_untangle> I need them for things, since i don't find people selling music videos on amazon.
[2016/02/24 10:43:02] <sydney_untangle> maybe i should start selling music videos on amazon. :p
[2016/02/24 10:43:06] * Tobbi checks whether he can call back scammers.
[2016/02/24 10:44:56] * sydney_untangle calls Tobbi and scams him...
[2016/02/24 10:44:57] <sydney_untangle> :p
[2016/02/24 10:45:15] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Luckily, you don't have my number.
[2016/02/24 10:45:31] <leyyin> tell us your number Tobbi
[2016/02/24 10:45:32] * sydney_untangle scams Tobbi into shipping him chocolate... :p
[2016/02/24 10:45:41] <leyyin> pretty please?
[2016/02/24 10:45:52] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Really...
[2016/02/24 10:45:53] <Tobbi> leyyin: 011-8999-881-999-119-7253
[2016/02/24 10:47:13] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: That is a phone number? Looks more like a ipv6 ip address. ;p
[2016/02/24 10:47:32] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I am not allowed to send you youtube links. otherwise I'd send you one right now.
[2016/02/24 10:48:12] <sydney_untangle> Hehe. ;)
[2016/02/24 10:48:29] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Anything other than youtube I can use to show you videos?
[2016/02/24 10:48:30] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I can guess what one btw...
[2016/02/24 10:48:36] <leyyin> Tobbi, send it to me in private and I'll send it to sydney_untangle
[2016/02/24 10:48:44] <sydney_untangle> *facepalm*.
[2016/02/24 10:48:45] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/24 10:49:08] * sydney_untangle has school to do...
[2016/02/24 10:49:21] <leyyin> what, so you download youtube videos
[2016/02/24 10:49:27] <leyyin> but do not watch youtube?
[2016/02/24 10:49:47] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab8GtuPdrUQ
[2016/02/24 10:49:51] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/24 10:49:59] <Tobbi> That was useful.
[2016/02/24 10:50:07] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: I got tired of Tobbi constantly showing me youtube videos, so i stopped looking at them. :D
[2016/02/24 10:50:17] <leyyin> <+sydney_untangle> I rip videos off youtube, but thats about it.
[2016/02/24 10:51:00] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: I don't sit on youtube looking up random things, i only do what i *need* to do.
[2016/02/24 10:51:18] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Which is sit on youtube and look up random things?
[2016/02/24 10:51:28] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: What you do. :D
[2016/02/24 10:51:50] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Well...
[2016/02/24 10:52:30] <sydney_untangle> Never mind...
[2016/02/24 10:52:57] <Tobbi> For some reason, it's easier to remember that 01189998819991197253 than our own country's emergency phone number.
[2016/02/24 10:53:35] <Tobbi> Well, probably not.
[2016/02/24 10:53:51] <leyyin> geek meter is at god
[2016/02/24 10:54:04] <sydney_untangle> are phone numbers look like 1-000-000-0000
[2016/02/24 10:54:16] <sydney_untangle> :D
[2016/02/24 10:55:21] <Tobbi> leyyin: But you know IT Crowd, don't you?
[2016/02/24 10:55:33] <Tobbi> For some reason, I have never watched Big Bang Theory, but I love IT Corwd.
[2016/02/24 10:55:35] <Tobbi> *Crowd
[2016/02/24 10:55:49] <leyyin> I did not watch any of them
[2016/02/24 10:55:58] <Tobbi> Good thing.

[2016/02/24 11:03:57] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: A couple of the clips are funny, but in not going to sit and watch it.
[2016/02/24 11:04:17] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: But you have seen some clips.
[2016/02/24 11:04:58] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: And thats all i saw funny... that was a while ago. you should play freedroidrpg. :D
[2016/02/24 11:05:08] <Tobbi> freedroidrpg...never heard of that.

[2016/02/24 11:05:47] <sydney_untangle> You would find it interesting. :)
[2016/02/24 11:06:59] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: What is it?
[2016/02/24 11:07:31] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Its an RPG, where robots take over the "world", and you have to beat them and bring everything back to the way it was(somewhat).
[2016/02/24 11:08:19] <sydney_untangle> Its a good time waster. :p

[2016/02/24 11:10:55] <Tobbi> What?
[2016/02/24 11:11:48] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: It should fertalize your lawn, at least thats what most ruralish homes do...
[2016/02/24 11:12:05] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: My lawn doesn't need any more fertilization.
[2016/02/24 11:12:24] <leyyin> I hope you protect your lawn rain forest
[2016/02/24 11:14:11] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/24 11:14:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: I do, but my neighbors disprove of it.
[2016/02/24 11:14:40] <leyyin> you should call the police, they want to burn the rain forest!!!!

[2016/02/24 11:24:46] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: It's lovely when there is no one else seeding a debian package for you to download...
[2016/02/24 11:25:10] <sydney_untangle> Ive had these torrents going for days, and only recieved 80mb from one of the .iso files. o_O
[2016/02/24 11:26:02] <leyyin> you should buy debian
[2016/02/24 11:28:08] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Why don't you simply get the debian package off somewhere else?
[2016/02/24 11:28:15] <Tobbi> I don't know anything about Debian.
[2016/02/24 11:29:09] <sydney_untangle> lol.
[2016/02/24 11:29:27] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Im downloading it to seed, but its hard to seed when i cannot download it. :D
[2016/02/24 11:29:45] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Try planting it instead of seeding it.
[2016/02/24 11:29:55] <Tobbi> It just needs some water, and sun...and stuff like that.
[2016/02/24 11:29:57] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: I think debian is surviving on donations.
[2016/02/24 11:30:04] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: planting is seeding...
[2016/02/24 11:30:05] <Tobbi> And eventually you'll have a full-grown tree, eeh package.
[2016/02/24 11:30:18] <sydney_untangle> At least in the american language...
[2016/02/24 11:41:59] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Landline phones are also rediculously expensive as well... 60-100$/month.
[2016/02/24 11:42:05] <Tobbi> WHAT?
[2016/02/24 11:42:06] <Tobbi> No way.
[2016/02/24 11:42:27] <Tobbi> I'm paying 19.95 EUR for telephone and internet.
[2016/02/24 11:55:27] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Exactly.
[2016/02/24 11:55:41] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: your home phone is not VOIP?
[2016/02/24 11:55:52] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: No, it isn't.
[2016/02/24 11:55:56] <Tobbi> At least I don't think it is.
[2016/02/24 11:55:57] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: You cannot get internet alone over here for less than 35$/month.
[2016/02/24 11:56:03] <Tobbi> wow.
[2016/02/24 11:56:25] <sydney_untangle> My 3mb conection would be 50$/month if i paid for it.
[2016/02/24 11:56:50] <sydney_untangle> Because im a mile from a DSL conection...
[2016/02/24 11:57:02] <mt> fwiw, Deutsche Telekom started switching landline to VoIP (but with landline numbers, still; so indistinguishable) but usually landline is the same price
[2016/02/24 11:58:23] <sydney_untangle> I can get a VOIP phone for like 15$/ month, but i don't trust our internet with that.
[2016/02/24 11:58:45] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/02/24 11:59:15] <Tobbi> Actually, it could be voip.
[2016/02/24 11:59:29] <Tobbi> My phone is jacked up to the cable modem.
[2016/02/24 11:59:30] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: You can get mobile phone service for as low as 10$/month around here, so thats one of the reasons people prefer it. ;)
[2016/02/24 11:59:45] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Then it probably is VOIP.
[2016/02/24 12:00:02] <sydney_untangle> I have neighbors that are VOIP, simplifies the system quite a bit.
[2016/02/24 12:00:18] <mt> most VoIP-only VoIP providers in Germany are using per-minute billing systems
[2016/02/24 12:00:43] <sydney_untangle> mt: Ah, over here most pay a month-per-month flat fee.
[2016/02/24 12:01:02] <sydney_untangle> For almost everything.
[2016/02/24 12:01:33] <Tobbi> How do I find out whether it's voip?
[2016/02/24 12:01:52] <mt> Tobbi: what provider are you with?
[2016/02/24 12:01:58] <Tobbi> mt: Kabel Deutschland.
[2016/02/24 12:02:05] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Do they feed to your cable modem with just a ethernet wire?
[2016/02/24 12:02:07] <mt> hm, dunno about them
[2016/02/24 12:02:14] * Tobbi checks.
[2016/02/24 12:02:19] <mt> maybe just look into your modem/router's settings?
[2016/02/24 12:02:37] <sydney_untangle> and your phone and computer both plug into your modem/router thingy?
[2016/02/24 12:02:40] <Tobbi> It's a coaxial cable.
[2016/02/24 12:02:48] <sydney_untangle> Hrm.
[2016/02/24 12:02:56] <sydney_untangle> Thats a strange cable imho.
[2016/02/24 12:03:08] <mt> that's not strange for cable internet at all
[2016/02/24 12:03:50] <mt> also, well it's not landline in the original sense, I guess
[2016/02/24 12:03:57] <sydney_untangle> Anyways, ive never seen it over here, im used to either DSL or (mainly) ethernet wire being fed right to a router.
[2016/02/24 12:05:02] <mt> you also don't live in a bigger city, do you?
[2016/02/24 12:05:19] <Tobbi> I used to have internet via Deutsche Telekom, but they were way too expensive.
[2016/02/24 12:06:25] <Tobbi> Not sure I can even check my cable modem's config page.
[2016/02/24 12:06:35] <Tobbi> For all I know, I checked the direct gateway setting.

[2016/02/24 12:23:47] <Hume2> Hello
[2016/02/24 12:24:24] <Tobbi> Hume2: Uh? What do you mean by that?
[2016/02/24 12:24:30] <Tobbi> You're having trouble hearing?
[2016/02/24 12:24:42] <Hume2> Well, sometimes.
[2016/02/24 12:24:57] <Hume2> I really don't understand the sounds.
[2016/02/24 12:25:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: I kept a Microsoft scammer on the phone for 45 minutes. That's gotta be a big achievement right there.
[2016/02/24 12:26:37] <Hume2> Yeah, it is.
[2016/02/24 12:27:18] <Hume2> You know, I hear, but I don't know anything about music.
[2016/02/24 12:28:17] <Hume2> I don't hear even the obvious things about music, like consonancy.
[2016/02/24 12:28:38] <Hume2> For me all teo tones are consonant :P
[2016/02/24 12:28:52] <Hume2> *two
[2016/02/24 12:29:19] <Tobbi> uh?
[2016/02/24 12:29:21] <Tobbi> Weird.
[2016/02/24 12:29:28] <sydney_untangle> :)
[2016/02/24 12:31:42] <Hume2> People usually get a really trange feeling when they hear me singing :D

[2016/02/24 12:33:37] <Tobbi> Hume2: Try beatboxing.
[2016/02/24 12:33:39] <Tobbi> Might be easier. :P
[2016/02/24 12:33:44] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/24 12:34:17] <Hume2> Well, even recognize two tones is hard for me.
[2016/02/24 12:35:27] <Hume2> My hearing skills are limited to the length and      volume of the tone.
[2016/02/24 12:35:54] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/02/24 12:36:05] <leyyin> ...mmh
[2016/02/24 12:36:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: So, does it pose any problems communicating with other people?

[2016/02/24 12:41:24] <Tobbi> I just noticed something: I should've had a look at Wikipedia regarding languages in their own language.
[2016/02/24 12:45:58] <Tobbi> I mean: They have this nice list next to each article.

[2016/02/24 13:02:22] <Hume2> leyyin: What does hakenkreuz mean in Chineese?
[2016/02/24 13:02:32] <Hume2> It is a Chineese word IIRC.
[2016/02/24 13:02:39] <leyyin> no, it is not
[2016/02/24 13:02:52] <Hume2> Well, it is Chineese symbol.
[2016/02/24 13:02:59] <leyyin> it's indian
[2016/02/24 13:03:05] <Hume2> I forgot.

[2016/02/24 13:04:14] <Hume2> It means swastika. That would make sense.
[2016/02/24 13:04:17] <Tobbi> leyyin: I know that modarchod is a swear word in Indian.
[2016/02/24 13:04:18] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/24 13:04:30] <Tobbi> or is it madarchod.

[2016/02/24 13:24:59] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/24 13:25:03] <leyyin> about brmbrmcar
[2016/02/24 13:25:06] <Hume2> I'm talking about the lawyers you're trying to contact.
[2016/02/24 13:25:41] <Hume2> Sorry if this was a misunderstantment.
[2016/02/24 13:26:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: Oh, I don|t think they're actively ignoring me. Maybe their workload is just too high.
[2016/02/24 13:26:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: I thought you had ignored that guy?
[2016/02/24 13:26:54] <leyyin> what guy?
[2016/02/24 13:27:01] <Hume2> So they pretend that they work too much, so they can't even asnwer you.
[2016/02/24 13:27:04] <leyyin> who? :D
[2016/02/24 13:27:16] <Hume2> The Doctor :D
[2016/02/24 13:27:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: brmbrmcar of course.
[2016/02/24 13:27:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: No, they just didn|t reply. Maybe the question was too difficult for them.

[2016/02/24 13:28:07] <leyyin> for Tobbi
[2016/02/24 13:28:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: Depends on the keyboard lazout.
[2016/02/24 13:28:34] <Hume2> I've once put a Doctor Who easter egg into one of my levels.
[2016/02/24 13:28:35] <Tobbi> I'm actively switching between German and English layouts.
[2016/02/24 13:28:35] <leyyin> Lasagne, hmm
[2016/02/24 13:28:43] <Tobbi> leyyin: Lasagne reminds me.

[2016/02/24 13:31:31] <leyyin> :(
[2016/02/24 13:31:49] <Tobbi> huh?
[2016/02/24 13:31:54] <leyyin> no, I don't
[2016/02/24 13:32:00] <leyyin> should I feel sad?
[2016/02/24 13:32:11] <Tobbi> leyyin: Probably not.
[2016/02/24 13:32:22] <leyyin> I am legally downloading it now
[2016/02/24 13:32:39] <Hume2> Legally? LOL
[2016/02/24 13:32:40] <Tobbi> leyyin: Where?
[2016/02/24 13:32:46] <Tobbi> And, are you serious?
[2016/02/24 13:32:50] <leyyin> only romanians are allowed
[2016/02/24 13:32:59] <Hume2> Who downloads films legally?
[2016/02/24 13:33:06] <Tobbi> of course.
[2016/02/24 13:33:14] <Tobbi> Hume2: I do. For a very narrow definition of legal.
[2016/02/24 13:33:16] <leyyin> Hume2, me
[2016/02/24 13:33:31] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/24 13:34:07] <Hume2> Do you know Doctor Who series 19?
[2016/02/24 13:34:26] <leyyin> I feel like I am a different race of geek
[2016/02/24 13:34:27] <brmbrmcar> Who is Series 19? :D
[2016/02/24 13:34:29] <leyyin> no, I don't
[2016/02/24 13:34:43] <Tobbi> leyyin: Don't mind. I am not a geek, either.
[2016/02/24 13:34:44] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: That's classic.
[2016/02/24 13:34:50] <Tobbi> I have no interest in all these geek things...
[2016/02/24 13:34:56] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2016/02/24 13:35:15] * brmbrmcar hate classic!
[2016/02/24 13:35:30] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It was broadcasted in the year 1982.
[2016/02/24 13:35:32] <Tobbi> That was a classic brmbrmcar line.
[2016/02/24 13:36:01] <Hume2> I personally like the series 18-21.
[2016/02/24 13:36:08] <brmbrmcar> I only briefly know the early ones.
[2016/02/24 13:36:34] <Hume2> There is TARDIS is SuperTux o.O
[2016/02/24 13:36:49] <brmbrmcar> Huh?
[2016/02/24 13:37:13] <Hume2> However, that appearance of TARDIS is only in those series.
[2016/02/24 13:37:28] <Hume2> It's the Master's TARDIS.
[2016/02/24 13:38:06] <brmbrmcar> Is supertux?
[2016/02/24 13:38:27] <brmbrmcar> ?
[2016/02/24 13:38:34] <Hume2> Yes, it is in SuperTux. However, you must know that TARDIS.
[2016/02/24 13:38:57] <brmbrmcar> Where?
[2016/02/24 13:39:39] <Hume2> I mean this Master's TARDIS: http://www.figures.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=28662&d=1340650374
[2016/02/24 13:39:43] <brmbrmcar> ok
[2016/02/24 13:40:02] <brmbrmcar> But in SuperTux?
[2016/02/24 13:40:25] <Hume2> Well, it's a bit different, but yes.
[2016/02/24 13:40:33] <brmbrmcar> ok
[2016/02/24 13:40:39] <brmbrmcar> Where is it?
[2016/02/24 13:40:44] <brmbrmcar> In SuperTux?
[2016/02/24 13:41:14] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: It only works once you spin around 360 degrees, then yell "SuperTux" at the top of your voice.
[2016/02/24 13:41:27] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/24 13:41:41] <brmbrmcar> It seems like it would work.
[2016/02/24 13:42:15] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/images/tiles/castle/column.png
[2016/02/24 13:42:31] <brmbrmcar> Oh yes.
[2016/02/24 13:42:43] <brmbrmcar> It is still quite different.
[2016/02/24 13:43:53] <Hume2> Narre lolled when I shew him that.
[2016/02/24 13:44:10] <brmbrmcar> lel
[2016/02/24 13:50:18] <Some_Person> I played SuperTux last night for the first time in years. Seems like a lot of nice little touches have been added over the years :)
[2016/02/24 13:52:30] <Some_Person> only played a few levels so I haven't seen much, but it looks like there's a lot more parallax scrolling, more concepts that used to pretty much be exclusive to the forest world in icyisland, and I like the newer music I heard
[2016/02/24 13:52:46] <Some_Person> Also really like the melting effect on the badguys, that's an awesome little touch
[2016/02/24 13:53:25] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/24 13:54:30] <Some_Person> I was a bit surprised to see that the silly tux rap is still around though :P
[2016/02/24 13:54:55] <Some_Person> ISTR someone saying that it should /never/ make it in a stable release
[2016/02/24 13:55:25] <Some_Person> and not only is it still there, but tux has dance moves now :P
[2016/02/24 13:58:49] @ Quit: bb010g: Quit: Connection closed for inactivity
[2016/02/24 13:59:26] <mt> yes I think we saw this rap thing in the grumbel grumbles document recently
[2016/02/24 13:59:40] <mt> no one cared to remove it
[2016/02/24 13:59:52] <mt> we didn't know about it being bad? (is it still?)
[2016/02/24 14:00:02] <mt> so it got into the release
[2016/02/24 14:00:18] <Some_Person> I think it's kinda cute to be honest :)
[2016/02/24 14:03:21] <Hume2> Some_Person: Weren't you a SuperTux developer?
[2016/02/24 14:03:45] <Some_Person> Hume2: No, I wasn't really a dev, but I made some tiny contributions
[2016/02/24 14:04:12] <Hume2> I knew that I know you from somewhere.
[2016/02/24 14:04:19] <Hume2> Nice to meet you.
[2016/02/24 14:04:26] <Some_Person> Nice to meet you too :)
[2016/02/24 14:05:35] <mt> I recognized your realname from the git commit logs or someplace when you joined (if anyone's wondering - yes I've got some magic that displays realnames/accountnames in join messages)
[2016/02/24 14:06:45] <mt> or was it the castle level author in forest world?
[2016/02/24 14:09:03] <Some_Person> I don't recall ever making a whole level
[2016/02/24 14:10:52] <mt> data/levels/world2/Castle_Entrance.stl
[2016/02/24 14:10:54] <mt> 4:  (author "Sam Townsend")
[2016/02/24 14:11:10] <Hume2> Yeah, that level.
[2016/02/24 14:12:01] <Some_Person> Oh, right, I do vaguely remember that. But that's not much of a level, just kinda a way to make the keys work IIRC, right?
[2016/02/24 14:12:40] <mt> indeed
[2016/02/24 14:13:50] <Hume2> Won't you mind if this was removed?
[2016/02/24 14:14:10] <Some_Person> Nah, it's pretty much a placeholder.
[2016/02/24 14:14:14] <mt> Some_Person: fwiw, we've got some updated ideas for the next release: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Milestone-3-Design-Document
[2016/02/24 14:14:22] <mt> you might be interested in that one
[2016/02/24 14:14:42] <mt> also, https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/GSoC-2016-Ideas
[2016/02/24 14:14:58] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/24 14:15:02] <Hume2> I began with redesigning the forest world, because noone here was about to do that.
[2016/02/24 14:15:12] <Hume2> It's the forest branch.
[2016/02/24 14:15:19] <Some_Person> IIRC, there was a level at one point called "Under Construction" that did the key thing in a nicer way, but it only implemented 3 of them
[2016/02/24 14:15:58] <mt> I also liked that better
[2016/02/24 14:15:58] <Hume2> ikr
[2016/02/24 14:16:38] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/24 14:16:55] <Hume2> The level is still there, just not used.
[2016/02/24 14:17:02] <mt> Hume2: what I'd like to see would be somehow merging the content of two different worldmaps on runtime
[2016/02/24 14:17:20] <Some_Person> merging the worldmaps?
[2016/02/24 14:17:31] <mt> like, so they appear as one worldmap
[2016/02/24 14:17:43] <mt> but being in different files, and without using teleporters
[2016/02/24 14:17:55] <Hume2> Well, that would produce a huge worldmap.
[2016/02/24 14:18:00] <mt> because with teleporters they look like two different worldmaps
[2016/02/24 14:18:18] <mt> Hume2: that's what we kind of want for the redesign I think
[2016/02/24 14:18:24] <Some_Person> I know icyisland and the forest world used to be connected, but I'm pretty sure it used teleporters (though it had an animation of tux riding in a boat IIRC)
[2016/02/24 14:18:38] <Hume2> mt: It also increases the loading time.
[2016/02/24 14:18:49] <Hume2> And it's teddious to edit it.
[2016/02/24 14:19:04] <mt> Hume2: that's why it would be *two* different files
[2016/02/24 14:19:10] <mt> (re: editing)
[2016/02/24 14:19:20] <Hume2> Oh, like that.
[2016/02/24 14:19:35] <Hume2> That shouldn't be a problem.
[2016/02/24 14:19:39] <mt> I want them to look like *one* but actually be *two*
[2016/02/24 14:19:55] <mt> Because the boat-teleporter-boat thing doesn't look nice
[2016/02/24 14:20:16] <mt> (imho)
[2016/02/24 14:20:16] <Hume2> It was an invisible teleporter.
[2016/02/24 14:20:33] <mt> it still turned the screen black, and then showed the other worldmap
[2016/02/24 14:20:59] <mt> and you couldn't see the other island when being in a different worldmap
[2016/02/24 14:21:03] <Hume2> Maybe because it wasn't loaded?
[2016/02/24 14:21:27] <Hume2> Oh, that way you mean that.
[2016/02/24 14:21:35] <Hume2> That would be harder.
[2016/02/24 14:22:40] <Hume2> See you tomorrow.

[2016/02/24 14:23:32] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/24 14:24:58] <Some_Person> I feel like the boat teleporter thing is probably good enough
[2016/02/24 14:25:50] <Tobbi> Oh, by spaces I mean the spaces in https://github.com/SuperTux/tinygettext/pull/3/files in my editor.
[2016/02/24 14:29:43] <Some_Person> But yeah, if someone would be willing to extend "Under Construction" or implement something else entirely, feel free to trash my stupid level

[2016/02/25 03:59:15] <Necrosporus> There is some problems with SuperTux game mechanics I think
[2016/02/25 03:59:46] <Necrosporus> For example if there is a level starting with a big pile of coins, you can get infinite coins by grabbing them and stepping into a pit repeatedly
[2016/02/25 04:00:29] <Necrosporus> Also if you fall into a bottomless pit, you lose your bonus after restart, but if you happen to smash "restart level" fast enough you retain your helmet
[2016/02/25 04:01:05] <Necrosporus> If you do it after you fall into pit while tux is still falling
[2016/02/25 04:03:27] <Necrosporus> Also what is the use of backflip jump? Most of time you could do same thing with regular jump, but you often do backflip when you really want to hit a brick with your rear
[2016/02/25 04:03:54] @ stewboy joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/25 04:04:55] <Necrosporus> That's my notes taken from playing supertux through first world. How many areas are there? I mean, you go though a plain, then into cave, then...
[2016/02/25 04:05:58] <Necrosporus> About multiplayer. I guess, that actually maybe two players should play on separate computers
[2016/02/25 04:06:29] <Necrosporus> Then each sees area around one of them
[2016/02/25 04:10:57] <Necrosporus> Also game happen to be a little slow on my computer in certain areas
[2016/02/25 04:27:44] <Necrosporus> Also supertux eats cpu time while being paused
[2016/02/25 04:29:29] <Necrosporus> Also if non-english keyboard is active, supertux keybinding break

[2016/02/25 11:08:43] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Arg, the way debian implements UEFI detection is buggy and unreliable. o_O
[2016/02/25 11:08:47] <sydney_untangle> :D
[2016/02/25 11:09:35] <sydney_untangle> Good thing for CSM. :D
[2016/02/25 11:10:10] <mt> that's why no sane person would install debian using debian-installer
[2016/02/25 11:10:51] <sydney_untangle> mt: WHy?
[2016/02/25 11:11:00] <sydney_untangle> Or, should i ask, how would you do it?
[2016/02/25 11:11:20] <mt> use debootstrap
[2016/02/25 11:11:37] <sydney_untangle> I have nothing but issues with the GUI installer, but besides this UEFI issue, the "normal" installer works great.
[2016/02/25 11:13:17] <sydney_untangle> You'd think that for being such a stable OS that their installer would be better. ;)
[2016/02/25 11:15:40] <mt> it installs a lot of bullshit
[2016/02/25 11:16:19] <sydney_untangle> To an extent that is true.
[2016/02/25 11:16:32] <sydney_untangle> Not as bad as ubuntu though. ;)
[2016/02/25 11:17:35] <mt> ubuntu installs the same bullshit
[2016/02/25 11:17:43] <mt> not more or less than debian
[2016/02/25 11:17:57] <mt> as does linux mint

[2016/02/26 12:42:52] <Hume2> LOL, I have a screen full of join/quit messages o.O
[2016/02/26 12:44:18] <mt> there was a netsplit
[2016/02/26 12:45:22] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/26 12:45:26] <brmbrmcar> I just timed out
[2016/02/26 12:45:42] <brmbrmcar> I made a terrible song about Netsplit
[2016/02/26 12:48:10] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/26 12:48:27] <Hume2> My songs are just surrealistic craps.
[2016/02/26 12:50:54] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/26 12:54:06] <Hume2> I was just recording random sounds and put a lots of effects to that.
[2016/02/26 12:54:14] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/26 12:54:48] <Hume2> Sometimes I even tried to add my speech to it.
[2016/02/26 12:54:58] <Hume2> It's terrible, I know.
[2016/02/26 12:55:01] <brmbrmcar> lel
[2016/02/26 12:55:23] <brmbrmcar> I never tried
[2016/02/26 12:55:45] <brmbrmcar> I can't record sounds without getting my camera ad converting them.

[2016/02/26 13:57:59] <mt> "Updated"
[2016/02/26 13:58:06] <mt> this is still a bit unclear
[2016/02/26 13:58:25] <Hume2> It's explained bellow.
[2016/02/26 13:58:29] <mt> also, rather use imperative in commit messages
[2016/02/26 13:58:34] <mt> "Redesign ..."
[2016/02/26 13:58:42] <Hume2> OK
[2016/02/26 13:58:46] <mt> "Update ..."
[2016/02/26 13:58:46] <mt> "Fix ..."
[2016/02/26 13:59:06] <Hume2> But why? It doesn't make any sense.
[2016/02/26 13:59:12] <brmbrmcar> +1
[2016/02/26 13:59:20] <Hume2> Because it's already done.
[2016/02/26 13:59:29] <Hume2> It's not a TODO.
[2016/02/26 14:00:21] <mt> https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches#L112
[2016/02/26 14:01:46] <mt> also, https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches#L88 -> updated, redesigned isn't well described
[2016/02/26 14:01:54] <brmbrmcar> Rules, rules.
[2016/02/26 14:02:18] <mt> second one could've been data/levels/world2/diagonal_chasm.stl: rename, add to worldmap
[2016/02/26 14:05:20] <Hume2> It doesn't make any sense at all, but OK.
[2016/02/26 14:07:17] <brmbrmcar> It is incorrect grammatically to do that anyway.
[2016/02/26 14:07:34] <brmbrmcar> It has to be like a request for that...
[2016/02/26 14:07:44] <brmbrmcar> Who wrote the rules?
[2016/02/26 14:08:09] <Hume2> I think so.
[2016/02/26 14:08:50] <Hume2> That line was last edited by: https://github.com/gitster
[2016/02/26 14:10:14] <brmbrmcar> It should be fixed
[2016/02/26 14:10:24] <brmbrmcar> That rule is so stupid.
[2016/02/26 14:10:51] <brmbrmcar> "You must be gramatically incorrect"
[2016/02/26 14:11:12] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/26 14:11:17] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/26 14:12:51] <Hume2> In my opinion, it should be like a description what has been changed.
[2016/02/26 14:12:58] <brmbrmcar> yes
[2016/02/26 14:13:10] <Hume2> Like if you had to tell it someone.
[2016/02/26 14:13:18] <brmbrmcar> Indeed.
[2016/02/26 14:13:41] <brmbrmcar> I think I just hit something...
[2016/02/26 14:13:46] <brmbrmcar> It was fine
[2016/02/26 14:13:59] <brmbrmcar> Just made a noise I'd never heard
[2016/02/26 14:14:58] <Hume2> Was it at least as loud as some people in the parlament?
[2016/02/26 14:15:05] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/26 14:15:15] <brmbrmcar> No
[2016/02/26 14:15:25] <brmbrmcar> It just creeped me out
[2016/02/26 14:15:44] <brmbrmcar> and made the cursor on top thing and taskbar go onto loading.
[2016/02/26 14:15:44] <Hume2> Yeah.
[2016/02/26 14:16:00] <brmbrmcar> Like in parliament?
[2016/02/26 14:16:07] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/26 14:16:12] <brmbrmcar> WE WILL KILL brmbrmcar!
[2016/02/26 14:16:23] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/26 14:16:42] <brmbrmcar> THey imply that, I sometimes feel
[2016/02/26 14:16:48] <Hume2> Once it was in the TV, how loud who was in the parliament.
[2016/02/26 14:17:13] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/26 14:17:27] <Hume2> Someone was 120Db loud, my record is 115Db I think.
[2016/02/26 14:18:12] <brmbrmcar> OK
[2016/02/26 14:18:19] <brmbrmcar> I'm quite loud
[2016/02/26 14:18:32] <brmbrmcar> I think I've got a bit quieter though.
[2016/02/26 14:19:00] <Hume2> I'm too. People tell me quite usually that I should speak more quiet.
[2016/02/26 14:19:28] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/26 14:19:40] <brmbrmcar> It canget annoying having a loud voice
[2016/02/26 14:19:49] <brmbrmcar> Particualrlyin school.
[2016/02/26 14:19:56] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/26 14:20:12] <Hume2> They hear how I
[2016/02/26 14:20:22] <brmbrmcar> yeah...
[2016/02/26 14:20:25] <Hume2> 'm going to trick the teachers :P
[2016/02/26 14:20:59] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/26 14:24:08] <Hume2> It's quite funny to trick in PE lessons.)
[2016/02/26 14:24:24] <Hume2> I usually hide behind the pillars :P
[2016/02/26 14:25:03] <Hume2> Going back in the queue is quite funny too.
[2016/02/26 14:25:08] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/26 14:25:29] <brmbrmcar> Do you getinto trouble?
[2016/02/26 14:25:41] <mt> Hume2: why would it be gramatically incorrect
[2016/02/26 14:25:53] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: No, they usually don't note it.
[2016/02/26 14:25:59] <mt> "as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change its behaviour"
[2016/02/26 14:26:12] <brmbrmcar> ok
[2016/02/26 14:26:34] <brmbrmcar> Taking to a codebase?
[2016/02/26 14:26:40] <Hume2> mt: Well, why give orders to the codebase?
[2016/02/26 14:26:43] <brmbrmcar> s/Taking/Talking/
[2016/02/26 14:26:43] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "Talking to a codebase?"
[2016/02/26 14:26:57] <Hume2> Codebase is silly and can't change itself.
[2016/02/26 14:27:04] <brmbrmcar> Codebase: Fix yourself!
[2016/02/26 14:27:09] <Hume2> Wow, it would be scary.
[2016/02/26 14:27:35] <mt> You can also read that as 'giving orders to Git'
[2016/02/26 14:27:35] <mt> Git, change abc to xyz
[2016/02/26 14:28:04] <Hume2> Well... makes a bit more sense.
[2016/02/26 14:28:11] <mt> And it's generally preferred to do it that way
[2016/02/26 14:28:15] <brmbrmcar> Codebase: @!"#^ &@#! %(*!
[2016/02/26 14:28:23] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/26 14:28:28] <mt> (by the larger community)
[2016/02/26 14:29:02] <Hume2> git change --update "data/levels/world2" --worldmap-change :D
[2016/02/26 14:29:16] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/26 14:29:21] <Tobbi> what?
[2016/02/26 14:29:22] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/26 14:29:24] <Tobbi> What the hell?
[2016/02/26 14:29:44] <Hume2> I'm giving commands to git to change the resources :P
[2016/02/26 14:30:07] <Hume2> Anyway why to give anyone a command when I've already done it?
[2016/02/26 14:30:28] <Tobbi> Oh, guys...
[2016/02/26 14:30:58] <brmbrmcar> What?
[2016/02/26 14:31:34] <Tobbi> silly.
[2016/02/26 14:31:36] <Tobbi> That talk is.
[2016/02/26 14:33:12] <Hume2> Also git/codebase doesn't read it at all, the community reads it. As I say, it doesn't make sense.
[2016/02/26 14:34:55] <mt> that might be because the name git describes its inventor, Linus Torvalds, who himself said he's a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28slang%29
[2016/02/26 14:36:58] <Hume2> That makes sense.
[2016/02/26 14:38:29] <mt> also, would you say 'Commit 1234567 changes ...' or 'Commit 1234567 changed ...' just after pushing it out?
[2016/02/26 14:38:43] <Hume2> b)
[2016/02/26 14:39:08] <Hume2> Well, both could be.
[2016/02/26 14:39:27] <mt> anyway
[2016/02/26 14:39:32] <mt> this discussion is pointless
[2016/02/26 14:43:33] <Hume2> Actually, I didn't mean it as past, but as passive.
[2016/02/26 14:47:17] <Hume2> OK, another topic.
[2016/02/26 14:49:16] <Tobbi> Let's talk about shoelaces.
[2016/02/26 14:49:56] <brmbrmcar> I hate them.
[2016/02/26 14:49:59] <Hume2> I have recently broke one.
[2016/02/26 14:50:31] <Hume2> I knew that must happen with that shoes.
[2016/02/26 14:50:57] <brmbrmcar> They are a stupid invention.
[2016/02/26 14:51:14] <Hume2> And noone has noticed that it's broken for two weeks.
[2016/02/26 14:51:24] <Hume2> Then I made a node.
[2016/02/26 14:51:30] <brmbrmcar> node?
[2016/02/26 14:51:51] <Hume2> Yes, I bound the two parts together.
[2016/02/26 14:51:57] <Tobbi> Your shoelace is broke? Maybe, a better investment might fix it.
[2016/02/26 14:52:12] <Hume2> Node works as well.
[2016/02/26 14:53:43] <Hume2> Actually, I usually don't touch the shoelace when I put the shoe on.
[2016/02/26 14:53:50] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/26 14:53:57] <brmbrmcar> I can't tie them
[2016/02/26 14:54:10] <Hume2> I can, but it's boring.
[2016/02/26 14:54:20] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/26 14:54:35] <brmbrmcar> I think I've got a solution
[2016/02/26 14:55:17] <Hume2> My shoelaces are always tied.
[2016/02/26 14:55:20] <Tobbi> Oh, great, I got a base.
[2016/02/26 14:55:55] <Hume2> Even when I have another shoes on my feet.

[2016/02/26 14:59:28] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/26 14:59:31] <brmbrmcar> Shall I make a shoelaces level? :D
[2016/02/26 14:59:40] <Hume2> You can.

[2016/02/26 15:00:06] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/26 15:00:07] <Tobbi> And what do they need to tie these shoes: Shoelaces.
[2016/02/26 15:00:09] <brmbrmcar> I hate shoes!
[2016/02/26 15:00:21] <brmbrmcar> But I really hate shoelaces!
[2016/02/26 15:00:27] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/02/26 15:00:37] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Will you stop being quasi-autistic?
[2016/02/26 15:00:41] <Hume2> Do you know what is worse than shoes and shoelaces together?
[2016/02/26 15:01:11] <Hume2> My grandma picking shoues for hours!
[2016/02/26 15:01:21] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/26 15:02:13] <Hume2> I was so tired, so I couldn't even sigh properly.
[2016/02/26 15:03:38] <Hume2> Yes it IS possible, Tobbi :D

[2016/02/26 15:16:51] <Hume2> Tie the evil shoes and get Penny back!
[2016/02/26 15:16:57] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/26 15:17:04] <Hume2> It could be a good add-on story :D
[2016/02/26 15:17:15] <brmbrmcar> The comeback is coming soon...
[2016/02/26 15:17:39] <brmbrmcar> To a poor sound and video quality cinema!
[2016/02/26 15:17:49] <Hume2> The secound shoe has caputured Penny again!

[2016/02/26 15:18:33] <Hume2> Super Tux Ties Back!
[2016/02/26 15:19:00] <Hume2> Like SuperTux Strikes Back, but with that shoe thingy.
[2016/02/26 15:19:56] <Hume2> I just must see your video again and again.
[2016/02/26 15:23:00] <brmbrmcar> ok
[2016/02/26 15:23:30] <Hume2> Maybe I should try to make some SuperTux related videos too.
[2016/02/26 15:26:13] <Hume2> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfUZZBGcbQk
[2016/02/26 15:28:03] <brmbrmcar> I've seen that
[2016/02/26 15:34:00] <Hume2> I could make an insane long level and then broadcast it.
[2016/02/26 15:34:20] <Hume2> SuperTux Marathon :D
[2016/02/26 15:34:44] <Hume2> Like really 40km = 100 000 blocks
[2016/02/26 15:35:23] <Hume2> Well, even 10 000 blocks long level lags properly.
[2016/02/26 15:35:47] <Hume2> Maybe it's also because it was only one sector.

[2016/02/26 15:46:13] <brmbrmcar> Sorry
[2016/02/26 15:46:20] <brmbrmcar> That was just my latest onde
[2016/02/26 15:46:28] <Hume2> What's your record?
[2016/02/26 15:46:42] <brmbrmcar> And I must have powerwashed, destroyed this machine about 100 times
[2016/02/26 15:46:55] <brmbrmcar> It was 9.1sometjing
[2016/02/26 15:47:00] <Hume2> That makes sense.
[2016/02/26 15:47:06] <Hume2> 9.19?
[2016/02/26 15:47:10] <brmbrmcar> Maybe
[2016/02/26 15:47:31] <Hume2> Narre's record is 9.21.
[2016/02/26 15:47:43] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/26 15:47:56] <brmbrmcar> I just attempted it once on screen record
[2016/02/26 15:48:05] <brmbrmcar> And it came out that way
[2016/02/26 15:49:18] <Hume2> I don't know how it's possible that I have 12 subscribers.
[2016/02/26 15:49:25] <Hume2> It's really weird.

[2016/02/26 16:21:54] <brmbrmcar> yeah
[2016/02/26 16:22:00] <brmbrmcar> What do you use?
[2016/02/26 16:22:25] <Hume2> Simple Screen Recorder.

[2016/02/27 04:39:35] <Hume2> Hello
[2016/02/27 04:39:38] <Tobbi> Hume2: Every level in TeraTux Reborn contains a lot of varying slopes, and a lot of recurring elements (given these are created by scripts, that's to be expected), still, it would make much more sense if there could be some altered elements in the levels.
[2016/02/27 04:39:50] <Tobbi> Also, hey
[2016/02/27 04:40:21] <Hume2> I still develop it.
[2016/02/27 04:40:24] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2016/02/27 04:40:33] <Hume2> Now it can generate even secret areas.
[2016/02/27 04:40:48] <Tobbi> Sounds great. Can those be considered secret then?
[2016/02/27 04:41:04] <Hume2> Not always, but yes.
[2016/02/27 04:41:44] <Tobbi> ah ok
[2016/02/27 04:42:50] <mt> Generating secret areas (size unspecified)... (this can take a long time)
[2016/02/27 04:43:18] <brmbrmcar> How is the Terrain Generator used?
[2016/02/27 04:43:23] <Tobbi> :D What?
[2016/02/27 04:43:36] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: It can be used to be included into flexlay.
[2016/02/27 04:43:50] <mt> Tobbi: Generating DH parameters ;)
[2016/02/27 04:43:58] <mt> (can also take a long time)
[2016/02/27 04:44:16] <Tobbi> mt: DH?
[2016/02/27 04:44:29] <mt> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange
[2016/02/27 04:44:30] <brmbrmcar> ok
[2016/02/27 04:44:33] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2016/02/27 04:44:34] <Tobbi> That one.
[2016/02/27 04:44:43] <Tobbi> mt: http://abkuerzungen.de/result.php?searchterm=DH&language=de :D
[2016/02/27 04:45:17] <Tobbi> That's what I was first looking at.
[2016/02/27 04:45:26] <mt> Hume2: what entropy source does the terrain generator use?
[2016/02/27 04:45:43] <mt> or how does it randomnize the output?
[2016/02/27 04:45:50] <Tobbi> mt: I assume it's galactic background noise.
[2016/02/27 04:46:09] <mt> heh, I tried to record that once
[2016/02/27 04:46:12] <brmbrmcar> I wouldn't think so.
[2016/02/27 04:46:17] <mt> I've got an SDR device
[2016/02/27 04:46:18] <Hume2> I don't know how is that algorithm called, I invented it myself.
[2016/02/27 04:46:37] <brmbrmcar> That requires either internet or a special device.
[2016/02/27 04:46:49] <mt> a friend is using a geiger counter :D
[2016/02/27 04:46:53] <brmbrmcar> So it isn't really that random?
[2016/02/27 04:47:15] <Tobbi> mt: Tell me: What haven't you got? You must be wealthy as f...
[2016/02/27 04:47:40] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/27 04:47:40] <mt> This SDR device is just an USB DVB-T receiver
[2016/02/27 04:47:47] <mt> I got it for like, 20 EUR
[2016/02/27 04:47:53] <Tobbi> hah, okay, so I have that as well :D
[2016/02/27 04:48:11] <mt> I mostly use it to receive ADS-B traffic
[2016/02/27 04:48:18] <mt> (airplanes)
[2016/02/27 04:48:42] <Tobbi> sounds interesting.
[2016/02/27 04:49:55] <Tobbi> Also: only 2 days until GSoC projects are announced :)
[2016/02/27 04:50:12] <brmbrmcar> 2 WHOLE days?
[2016/02/27 04:50:24] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: No, 2 sliced days.
[2016/02/27 04:50:47] <brmbrmcar> I thought it was more than 2 whole ones.
[2016/02/27 04:51:00] <mt> Tobbi: https://urandom.eu.org/i/5H3Ib4tT.png
[2016/02/27 04:51:45] <Tobbi> mt: How far does that reach?
[2016/02/27 04:52:05] <mt> distance is in nautical miles
[2016/02/27 04:52:16] <mt> with a good antenna you can reach 400 nm I think
[2016/02/27 04:52:27] <Tobbi> Hume2: What were you thinking by the way? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfUZZBGcbQk
[2016/02/27 04:52:34] <mt> that is limited by the earth's rounding and thei height of the airplane
[2016/02/27 04:52:58] <Tobbi> Hume2: And how the hell did you even script that?
[2016/02/27 04:53:05] <Tobbi> I see...
[2016/02/27 04:58:15] <Hume2> Tobbi: It's bad quality, there are bazilion rocks in one tile.
[2016/02/27 04:58:22] <Tobbi> Hume2: Ah, I see...

[2016/02/27 05:05:59] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You'd abuse such a feature :D
[2016/02/27 05:06:16] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You would transform a potential disco level into a disco hell with unicorns.
[2016/02/27 05:06:21] <mt> No
[2016/02/27 05:06:22] <Tobbi> Unicorns from hell.
[2016/02/27 05:06:31] <mt> it would, indeed, be used for abuse, most likely
[2016/02/27 05:06:31] <Tobbi> Okay, we don't. Good.
[2016/02/27 05:07:21] <brmbrmcar> I don't use unicorns.
[2016/02/27 05:07:42] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Did I say unicorns? I meant unicars.
[2016/02/27 05:08:05] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/27 05:08:22] <brmbrmcar> Oh no, OperationGT is uploading SuperTux videos.
[2016/02/27 05:08:28] <brmbrmcar> That is only trouble...
[2016/02/27 05:08:38] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How would you know?
[2016/02/27 05:08:43] <Tobbi> Do you know that person?
[2016/02/27 05:08:58] <mt> if 'License' on youtube isn't the creative commons one
[2016/02/27 05:09:03] <mt> we could probably report abuse
[2016/02/27 05:09:04] <brmbrmcar> He told me.
[2016/02/27 05:09:22] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/27 05:09:47] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Who is OperationGT? I have only seen him in here sometimes.
[2016/02/27 05:09:56] <brmbrmcar> My friend.
[2016/02/27 05:10:09] <Tobbi> Also, why is it so cold outside? -1.1C
[2016/02/27 05:10:21] <brmbrmcar> Aw. It's to warm out here.
[2016/02/27 05:10:32] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What do you consider warm?
[2016/02/27 05:11:07] <brmbrmcar> 0C
[2016/02/27 05:11:29] <brmbrmcar> for winter

[2016/02/27 14:24:28] <Tobbi> What is that?
[2016/02/27 14:24:37] <Hume2> It's a web game.

[2016/02/27 14:24:51] <brmbrmcar> I know that
[2016/02/27 14:25:02] <brmbrmcar> I played it a couple of times.
[2016/02/27 14:25:27] <Hume2> Yeah, you eat the smaller cells and try to not be eaten by a bigger cell.

[2016/02/27 14:27:48] <brmbrmcar> It takes too long.
[2016/02/27 14:27:55] <brmbrmcar> And I'm terrible at it.
[2016/02/27 14:27:57] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2016/02/27 14:28:10] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Help me develop flexlay? :P
[2016/02/27 14:28:15] <Tobbi> We can make this better.
[2016/02/27 14:28:31] <brmbrmcar> In Python?
[2016/02/27 14:28:37] <brmbrmcar> Oh no!

[2016/02/27 14:47:04] <sydney_untangle> lol.
[2016/02/27 14:47:24] <sydney_untangle> But i find youtube stabalizing to ruin quite a few things.
[2016/02/27 14:48:56] <brmbrmcar> What Tux.walk speed is maximum?
[2016/02/27 14:50:47] <Hume2> I have no idea.
[2016/02/27 14:50:53] <Hume2> I think that it's unlimited.
[2016/02/27 14:50:54] <brmbrmcar> Imeanfor normal gameplay.
[2016/02/27 14:51:05] <Hume2> No idea too.
[2016/02/27 14:51:08] <brmbrmcar> ok
[2016/02/27 14:51:21] <brmbrmcar> I'll try and see in the menu thing
[2016/02/27 14:54:21] <brmbrmcar> Where are Tux's movements scripted?
[2016/02/27 14:54:44] <brmbrmcar> for main menu
[2016/02/27 14:55:01] <Hume2> It's in the SuperTux source code.
[2016/02/27 14:55:25] <Hume2> Any level played by the menu is played automatically.
[2016/02/27 14:55:31] <brmbrmcar> Yes...
[2016/02/27 14:55:37] <brmbrmcar> I looked in there.
[2016/02/27 14:55:41] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2016/02/27 14:55:50] <brmbrmcar> Nothing looks right.
[2016/02/27 14:56:11] <Hume2> The menu level is in slower motion though.
[2016/02/27 14:57:03] <brmbrmcar> ok
[2016/02/27 15:08:24] <brmbrmcar> I'm trying something out

[2016/02/28 05:29:33] <Tobbi> mt: Woow, we're in a rather bad mood today, aren't we?
[2016/02/28 05:29:37] <mt> And I'd rather not judge people by neuroatypicality or disability
[2016/02/28 05:29:55] <Tobbi> mt: Any reason for you being in a bad mood?
[2016/02/28 05:30:08] <mt> I'm not being in a bad mood at all :)
[2016/02/28 05:30:27] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2016/02/28 05:30:38] <Tobbi> So, maybe you should get into a bad mood, so you'll calm down? I am not sure :P
[2016/02/28 05:31:30] <Tobbi> mt: Thing is: I've learned to accept brmbrmcar like he is, he's sometimes annoying, but this is not a very frequented channel, so I am okay with that for now.
[2016/02/28 05:52:53] <Tobbi> Hume2: ping
[2016/02/28 05:53:08] <Hume2> Tobbi: pong
[2016/02/28 05:53:23] <Tobbi> Hume2: Can you release nightly builds of the editor branch?
[2016/02/28 05:53:28] <Tobbi> Or at least regular development builds?
[2016/02/28 05:53:34] <Tobbi> Someone has been asking for it on the forums.
[2016/02/28 05:53:57] <Tobbi> http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=6533#p67711
[2016/02/28 05:54:10] <Tobbi> Okay, he's been asking about updates, but I figured we might as well let him check it out.
[2016/02/28 05:54:27] <Hume2> I don't know anything about the nightly builds.
[2016/02/28 05:54:44] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/28 05:54:53] <Tobbi> Hume2: Okay, we might as well tell him to compile it himself.
[2016/02/28 05:54:53] <mt> building for Linux is a pain
[2016/02/28 05:55:05] <Tobbi> mt: Why?
[2016/02/28 05:55:06] <mt> if you want to make it compatible with everything
[2016/02/28 05:55:11] <Tobbi> ah, yes.
[2016/02/28 05:55:18] <mt> because every distro ships different versions of libraries
[2016/02/28 05:55:23] <Tobbi> I guess we should tell him to compile it himself.
[2016/02/28 05:55:30] <mt> you'd have to link the entire OS statically

[2016/02/28 11:28:26] <Tobbi> I'm not the one who started nitpicking, just let me remind you :D
[2016/02/28 11:29:24] <mt> there's no specification that, when regexes are used in human languages, the / must exist
[2016/02/28 11:30:09] <Tobbi> mt: There's no specification regarding regular expressions in human languages, thus, our discourse regarding it is most likely false.
[2016/02/28 11:31:17] <mt> and as useless as most discussions in here
[2016/02/28 11:32:25] <Tobbi> mt: But at least you're participating, which means that, when you make remarks regarding its uselessness, you're actually also including a misbehaviour on your side into that.

[2016/02/29 05:51:48] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Smart tile = Smart tile templates. For example, select "Medium tree" and it will add a medium tree to your selection.
[2016/02/29 05:52:13] <Tobbi> I came up with "Smart tile", but the name should be changed in the final thing.
[2016/02/29 05:52:18] <Tobbi> Just wanted to give it a unique name.
[2016/02/29 06:03:44] <Tobbi> And in the final installment of it, you're also supposed to select the length of the object.
[2016/02/29 06:04:10] <Tobbi> I just need to find a good notation regarding that.

[2016/02/29 07:44:24] <Tobbi> eeh, move to the start.
[2016/02/29 07:44:35] <Tobbi> We should also have a function to spawn to a certain level.
[2016/02/29 07:44:47] <Tobbi> Aka, select the level and then spawn.

[2016/02/29 09:27:43] <Tobbi> And it's getting better and btter.

[2016/02/29 09:28:19] <Tobbi> I am reading the announcement currently.
[2016/02/29 09:28:22] <sydney_untangle> They need to upgrade the amount of ram...
[2016/02/29 09:28:42] <sydney_untangle> I was hoping they would, but the addition of wifi and bluetooth is nice.
[2016/02/29 09:28:56] <sydney_untangle> I still haven't bought a RPI. :p
[2016/02/29 09:29:05] <Tobbi> How do I find out which model I have, anyway?
[2016/02/29 09:29:56] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: How much ram does it have?
[2016/02/29 09:29:56] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Also, i think it should show it on the RPI itself, but ive no clue.
[2016/02/29 09:30:34] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/02/29 09:30:36] <Tobbi> I'll check.
[2016/02/29 09:33:05] <Tobbi> Apparently, I have '000e' => 'Model B Revision 2.0 512MB', (Sony)
[2016/02/29 09:33:27] <Tobbi> Also, I doubt SFLC will get back to me.
[2016/02/29 09:34:19] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: So it would be model B, at 512mb it looks like, that means that you are 2 revisions behind.
[2016/02/29 09:34:45] <sydney_untangle> I also hear that the new RPI is a power hog, probably the wifi and bluetooth modules faults.
[2016/02/29 09:34:54] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: You mean: B -> B2 -> B3
[2016/02/29 09:34:59] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/02/29 09:37:02] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Kind of.
[2016/02/29 09:37:03] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: What are you using as an IRC bouncer?
[2016/02/29 09:37:03] <sydney_untangle> ~ping
[2016/02/29 09:37:03] <red_bot> sydney_untangle: pong
[2016/02/29 09:37:05] <sydney_untangle> Aug, i lost my freenode connection.
[2016/02/29 09:37:09] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: ZNC
[2016/02/29 09:38:02] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Hmm.
[2016/02/29 09:38:09] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Why not just use SSH?
[2016/02/29 09:38:16] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: SSH? For what?
[2016/02/29 09:38:45] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Run a command line IRC client on your RPI and connect to it over SSH. ;)
[2016/02/29 09:38:56] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Why?
[2016/02/29 09:39:05] <Tobbi> It works fine the way it is now.
[2016/02/29 09:39:16] <sydney_untangle> \o/
[2016/02/29 09:39:43] <sydney_untangle> Never mind then. Use what works. ;)
[2016/02/29 09:40:01] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I am also connected to Moznet to spy on my former community members.
[2016/02/29 09:40:06] <Tobbi> Some seem to have given up.
[2016/02/29 09:41:54] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: :-)
[2016/02/29 09:42:15] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Maybe i should join... would give me something good to do. :p
[2016/02/29 09:42:26] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Join what?
[2016/02/29 09:43:10] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Your Mozilla comunity. :p
[2016/02/29 09:43:20] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I am no longer a member of mozilla.
[2016/02/29 09:43:31] <Tobbi> for good reasons.
[2016/02/29 09:43:35] * sydney_untangle nods...
[2016/02/29 09:44:58] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Was mozilla that bad to work with?
[2016/02/29 09:45:26] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: https://mozillatobbi.wordpress.com/2013/08/27/new-mozilla-or-community-2-0/

[2016/02/29 09:47:05] <sydney_untangle> Yay, Tobbi has a blog! :p

[2016/02/29 09:47:39] @ Quit: claymore2: Quit: Leaving
[2016/02/29 09:54:15] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Interesting blog post, and i do agree with you, but i'm not going to stop supporting mozilla for those reasons. :)
[2016/02/29 09:54:55] <sydney_untangle> Sure, they may not be doing everything perfect to everyones specs, but its the only real browser out there that still respects the user.
[2016/02/29 09:57:05] <sydney_untangle> THen again, who can please everyone? Nobody.
[2016/02/29 10:01:18] @ Hume2 joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/29 10:01:18] @ Mode +v Hume2 by ChanServ
[2016/02/29 10:01:25] <Hume2> Hello
[2016/02/29 10:04:29] <sydney_untangle> Hume2: Welcome.
[2016/02/29 10:15:09] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I still support them by using a nightly build.
[2016/02/29 10:16:49] <Tobbi> but not as an active member in their community.
[2016/02/29 10:17:17] <Tobbi> Hume2: Only a few hours before the GSoC orgs are announced :)
[2016/02/29 10:17:22] <Tobbi> Let's see if we made it.
[2016/02/29 10:17:31] <Hume2> I'm thrilled.
[2016/02/29 10:17:41] <Tobbi> I'm a little excited as well.
[2016/02/29 10:18:36] <Hume2> Anyway do you know what the shortcut "GSoC" resembles me?
[2016/02/29 10:18:46] <Tobbi> Hume2: Hopefully, in case we get accepted, there will always be enough people around.
[2016/02/29 10:18:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: what?
[2016/02/29 10:19:07] <Hume2> Like Google - SoC.
[2016/02/29 10:19:12] <Hume2> You know, socialism.
[2016/02/29 10:19:12] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2016/02/29 10:21:02] <Tobbi> Hume2: Do we have enough people to cover this? What if people drop by on IRC and no one from the team is present?
[2016/02/29 10:22:00] <Hume2> Tobbi: I've just seen the Bernd das Brot episode with that Bernd-bot.
[2016/02/29 10:22:09] <Tobbi> Hume2: which one?
[2016/02/29 10:22:22] <Hume2> Series 1, episode 17.
[2016/02/29 10:22:49] <Hume2> Maybe this could help :D
[2016/02/29 10:22:59] <Hume2> And now seriously.
[2016/02/29 10:24:37] <Hume2> Do we have to be connected all the time?
[2016/02/29 10:25:04] <Tobbi> Hume2: Don't think so, but we should add to the topic that people can mail at supertuxteam@ if they want.
[2016/02/29 10:25:17] <Hume2> Yes, we can.
[2016/02/29 10:26:20] <Tobbi> Hume2: You cannot receive mail to that, can you?
[2016/02/29 10:26:54] <Hume2> I can, someone gave me access.
[2016/02/29 10:26:57] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2016/02/29 10:27:07] <Hume2> Actually, I don't specate it much.
[2016/02/29 10:27:18] <Tobbi> Hume2: But still, it's fine.
[2016/02/29 10:27:42] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Actually, everyone is getting all the mail sent to that address right?

[2016/02/29 10:33:27] <Tobbi> What?
[2016/02/29 10:33:33] <Tobbi> I haven't seen him yesterday.
[2016/02/29 10:33:48] <Hume2> He joined and quit.
[2016/02/29 10:33:56] <Hume2> Without saying anything.
[2016/02/29 10:34:00] <Tobbi> ah ok.
[2016/02/29 10:34:05] <Tobbi> So, he's probably busy.
[2016/02/29 10:34:21] <Hume2> Apparently yes.
[2016/02/29 10:35:57] <Hume2> I've once seen a screenshot of IQ test with note: "IQ 124, That way I'm not the stupid one there."
[2016/02/29 10:36:06] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/29 10:38:11] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: What?
[2016/02/29 10:38:40] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: What I mean is: Does everyone who has access to supertuxteam@ via IMAP get the same messages?
[2016/02/29 10:38:49] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Nobody gets the mail sent to the openmailbox address except the person who logs into that email account and looks at it.
[2016/02/29 10:38:53] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2016/02/29 10:39:02] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Because I have it connected via IMAP in TB
[2016/02/29 10:39:15] <sydney_untangle> :-)
[2016/02/29 10:40:45] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle, Hume2: I'm uploading a video of SmartTiles™ in action right now :P
[2016/02/29 10:41:12] <sydney_untangle> heh.
[2016/02/29 10:41:17] <Hume2> Smart tiles?
[2016/02/29 10:41:30] <Hume2> Do you mean bonus blocks etc?
[2016/02/29 10:41:39] <Tobbi> Hume2, sydney_untangle: http://screencast.com/t/VDiqRy0wvik
[2016/02/29 10:41:40] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/29 10:41:50] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I also have the supertuxteam email account set up in my TB instalation.
[2016/02/29 10:42:06] <Tobbi> Hume2: No, instead of tiles, you select the relevant object.
[2016/02/29 10:42:41] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: When was our last twitter post? You could do a post about your smart tiles.
[2016/02/29 10:42:46] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: No, it's a development feature.
[2016/02/29 10:42:58] <Tobbi> It's not by any means complete.
[2016/02/29 10:43:04] <sydney_untangle> Or something...
[2016/02/29 10:43:18] <sydney_untangle> When was our last twitter post?
[2016/02/29 10:43:41] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I'd rather do the GSoC post.
[2016/02/29 10:43:48] <Tobbi> idk, probably about the meeting.
[2016/02/29 10:43:49] <Hume2> Tobbi: nice
[2016/02/29 10:44:08] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Looking good.
[2016/02/29 10:44:10] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Anyway, what I mean is: When you view messages, they don't get deleted / downloaded from the inbox, aka I can read them too right?
[2016/02/29 10:45:29] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Our last post was 20 days ago.
[2016/02/29 10:45:53] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: The inbox is synced, nothing gets deleted unless you delete it specifically, but if you view an email than it shows that you viewed it, if i said that correctly...
[2016/02/29 10:46:30] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Okay, makes sense.
[2016/02/29 10:46:32] <Tobbi> So, this is good.
[2016/02/29 10:46:47] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Does mt have access to that e-mail account?
[2016/02/29 10:46:56] <Tobbi> If not, you should give him access.
[2016/02/29 10:47:22] <Tobbi> Hume2: Anyway, next order of business is making the stuff resizable.
[2016/02/29 10:47:31] <Tobbi> Aka, that you can create smaller and bigger trees.
[2016/02/29 10:47:38] <Hume2> Yeah.
[2016/02/29 10:47:52] <Tobbi> Problem is: how do I store this data-structure wise?
[2016/02/29 10:48:10] <Tobbi> Currently, it's in a CSV file, but CSV is difficult to store these kind of things.
[2016/02/29 10:48:21] <Tobbi> You know: Some tile IDs can be repeated.
[2016/02/29 10:49:52] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: mt should have access, if not he can PM me and i can give him the log in info.
[2016/02/29 10:49:58] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2016/02/29 10:50:39] <Hume2> I'm not sure, Tobbi. Lisp wouldn't be any better AFAIK.
[2016/02/29 10:50:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: Hmm, okay...
[2016/02/29 10:51:09] <Tobbi> I could have a special marker regarding which tiles can be repeated.
[2016/02/29 10:51:16] <Tobbi> Aka, special format string.
[2016/02/29 10:51:30] <Hume2> I have just thought something.
[2016/02/29 10:51:41] <Tobbi> yes?

[2016/02/29 10:52:23] <Hume2> Maybe make 9 tables for miscelaneous stuff.
[2016/02/29 10:52:38] <Hume2> 1) The tiles those are in the top left corner.
[2016/02/29 10:53:02] <Hume2> 2) Top edge period, must be the same height as the (1).
[2016/02/29 10:53:29] <Hume2> 3) The tiles those are in the top right corner, must be the same height as (1).
[2016/02/29 10:53:49] <Hume2> 4) Left edge period, must be same width as (1).
[2016/02/29 10:54:00] <Hume2> 5) Middle period
[2016/02/29 10:54:17] <Hume2> 6) Right edge period, must be the same width as (3).
[2016/02/29 10:54:44] <Hume2> 7) The tiles those are in the bottom left corner, must be the same width as (1).
[2016/02/29 10:55:00] <Hume2> 8) bottom edge period, must be the same height as (7).
[2016/02/29 10:55:32] <Hume2> 9) The tiles those are in the bottom right corner, must be the same height as (7) ans the same width as (3).
[2016/02/29 10:56:04] <Hume2> Did you get it, Tobbi?
[2016/02/29 10:56:11] <Tobbi> It seems complicated.
[2016/02/29 10:56:44] <Hume2> My thoughts are complicated, that's not new for me :)
[2016/02/29 10:57:20] <Tobbi> Hume2: Probably a sign of your intelligence. :)
[2016/02/29 10:57:47] <Hume2> :) 1,3,7 and 9 are just plain unmodifiable sets of tiles.
[2016/02/29 10:58:12] <Hume2> 4 and 6 can repeat downwards.
[2016/02/29 10:58:27] <Hume2> 2 and 8 can repeat sidewards.
[2016/02/29 10:58:32] <Tobbi> I see...
[2016/02/29 10:58:39] <Tobbi> Hmm, I'd rather have it all in one row or something.
[2016/02/29 10:58:58] <Tobbi> Hume2: Currently, it looks like this: 10, Right sign,2,2,141
[2016/02/29 10:59:15] <Tobbi> ID, name, number of tiles x, number of tiles y, start ID
[2016/02/29 10:59:22] <Tobbi> Currently, only consecutive tiles are supported.
[2016/02/29 10:59:31] <Hume2> I see.
[2016/02/29 10:59:32] <Tobbi> but supporting the others shouldn't be too hard.
[2016/02/29 11:01:34] <Hume2> Maybe there could be a list of IDs, with possibilities like "Tile A, Tile B, (10 tiles, starting by Tile C), Tile D".
[2016/02/29 11:01:57] <Tobbi> Possibly.
[2016/02/29 11:01:58] <Hume2> You know, instead of naming all the tiles, it could be shorted.
[2016/02/29 11:02:22] <Tobbi> What I was thinking is: Maybe I should have sublists...
[2016/02/29 11:02:46] <Hume2> This could help.
[2016/02/29 11:03:25] <Hume2> Any idea when the GSoC thing will be known?
[2016/02/29 11:03:55] <Hume2> I'll make a forest level while waiting.
[2016/02/29 11:04:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: Today at 8pm my time.
[2016/02/29 11:04:18] <Tobbi> 7pm GMT
[2016/02/29 11:04:26] <Tobbi> So, 3 more hours to go.
[2016/02/29 11:04:37] <Hume2> Yeah, my time is the same.
[2016/02/29 11:06:48] <Tobbi> Hume2: I'm excited... :D
[2016/02/29 11:06:59] <Tobbi> I'm already thinking of visiting MV again.
[2016/02/29 11:07:00] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/29 11:08:09] <mt> did we get accepted for GSoC yet? :D
[2016/02/29 11:08:17] <mt> (not a serious question)
[2016/02/29 11:08:37] <Tobbi> mt: *grr*
[2016/02/29 11:08:55] <mt> sydney_untangle: no I don't have access to that account but I don't need access anyway
[2016/02/29 11:09:11] <mt> sydney_untangle: if you want, forward a copy to mteufel@urandom.eu.org
[2016/02/29 11:09:21] <mt> a copy of incoming mail, even
[2016/02/29 11:09:29] <Tobbi> mt: You know, sometimes it's really hard to know whether you're serious or not...
[2016/02/29 11:09:53] <Tobbi> One time you're joking, the other time you're mad at us for breaking channel rules.
[2016/02/29 11:13:03] <Hume2> Tobbi: What is MV?
[2016/02/29 11:13:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: Mountain View.
[2016/02/29 11:13:17] <Hume2> OK
[2016/02/29 11:14:15] <Hume2> If we got accepted, can we afford a spamming party?
[2016/02/29 11:14:26] <Tobbi> Hume2: spamming party?
[2016/02/29 11:14:49] <Hume2> Yes, it's that you write nonsense strings like confetti.
[2016/02/29 11:14:59] <Tobbi> Hume2: We should invite brmbrmcar.
[2016/02/29 11:15:12] <Hume2> Indeed :P
[2016/02/29 11:17:48] <Tobbi> Some_Person: You're in a lot of places all at once. I saw you talking on #csharp
[2016/02/29 11:17:54] <Tobbi> sorry, ##csharp
[2016/02/29 11:17:56] <mt> brmbrmcar as GSoC mentor
[2016/02/29 11:18:07] <mt> make SuperTux GSoC GREAT AGAIN
[2016/02/29 11:18:23] <Tobbi> mt: He'd propose brmbrmtux.
[2016/02/29 11:18:34] <mt> wait I forgot
[2016/02/29 11:18:45] <mt> brmbrmcar as brmbrmtux brmbrmmaintainer
[2016/02/29 11:18:58] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/29 11:19:10] <Tobbi> He'd be great as a mentor.
[2016/02/29 11:19:25] <Tobbi> For some other project, we want to see vanished from Open Source landscape.
[2016/02/29 11:20:41] <Tobbi> mt: By the way: Did freenode group stuff land already?
[2016/02/29 11:23:03] <mt> nope
[2016/02/29 11:23:11] <mt> but you might be able to ask
[2016/02/29 11:23:16] <mt> in #freenode
[2016/02/29 11:23:24] <mt> in order to become group contact
[2016/02/29 11:23:54] <mt> I have a shiny atheme/ cloak now :) (tho, atheme's been a group on freenode for a long time)
[2016/02/29 11:23:55] <Tobbi> I guess I should just wait.
[2016/02/29 11:28:12] <mt> well
[2016/02/29 11:28:25] <Tobbi> fountain
[2016/02/29 11:28:26] <mt> I've heard from certain people that you can now get project cloaks
[2016/02/29 11:28:40] <mt> even if you haven't registered before
[2016/02/29 11:28:56] <mt> you might just want to ask a staffer
[2016/02/29 11:29:16] <mt> active ones are usually on '/stats p'
[2016/02/29 11:29:58] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/02/29 11:32:12] <sydney_untangle> Are our nightlys still maintained/
[2016/02/29 11:32:17] <sydney_untangle> nightlies*
[2016/02/29 11:32:21] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: They're automatic.
[2016/02/29 11:32:29] <Tobbi> mt: People in #gsoc praise SuperTux :D
[2016/02/29 11:32:34] <mt> huh?
[2016/02/29 11:32:40] <mt> maybe I should join there
[2016/02/29 11:33:08] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Oh, ok.
[2016/02/29 11:33:20] <sydney_untangle> Im not joining #gsoc. :p
[2016/02/29 11:33:26] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: why not?
[2016/02/29 11:33:51] <mt> sydney_untangle: they should be up-to-date
[2016/02/29 11:33:53] <sydney_untangle> Because im not a part of it, you are.
[2016/02/29 11:34:04] <mt> OS X and Windows are at 0.4.0.312
[2016/02/29 11:34:05] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Relax, it's just an IRC channel.
[2016/02/29 11:34:11] <mt> git master is at 0.4.0.313
[2016/02/29 11:34:23] <mt> sydney_untangle: you're still a valuable part of the project
[2016/02/29 11:34:25] <Tobbi> Yes, because the build failed.
[2016/02/29 11:34:28] <Tobbi> Indeed.
[2016/02/29 11:34:36] <mt> and can represent the project to the outside as well
[2016/02/29 11:34:40] <sydney_untangle> mt: They look like they are. I wonder where the maintainer went from the IRC channel.

[2016/02/29 11:35:52] <mt> that's the software behind NickServ

[2016/02/29 11:36:15] <mt> 350 people is nothing
[2016/02/29 11:36:28] <sydney_untangle> I know, but it is a larger channel.
[2016/02/29 11:36:46] <sydney_untangle> mt: If 350 people is nothing then why do we only have 25? :p
[2016/02/29 11:37:00] <mt> I dunno
[2016/02/29 11:37:02] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Because people don't know there is an IRC channel.
[2016/02/29 11:37:03] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2016/02/29 11:37:07] <mt> well, okay 350 is quite large
[2016/02/29 11:37:08] <Tobbi> And because we're not as known
[2016/02/29 11:37:20] <mt> but I mean, compared to the 217000 users registered on freenode
[2016/02/29 11:37:36] <mt> the users I'm kind of responsible for now
[2016/02/29 11:37:37] <Tobbi> This is a big city right there.
[2016/02/29 11:38:04] <mt> well, I'm responsible for providing them a nice environment for IRCing

[2016/02/29 11:40:51] <Tobbi> mt: For example: That SuperTux game looks cool :-)
[2016/02/29 11:41:03] <Hume2> Sometimes I think that Bernd das Brot is about me or Tobbi.
[2016/02/29 11:41:13] <Tobbi> Hume2: Bernd das Brot is not about me.
[2016/02/29 11:41:21] <Tobbi> I don't drink flour soup.
[2016/02/29 11:41:25] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Most games look cool...
[2016/02/29 11:41:38] * sydney_untangle spits at the idea...
[2016/02/29 11:41:39] <mt> you know, I almost thought they'd be saying "SuperTux is holy we'll all follow the BrmGods and accept SuperTux"
[2016/02/29 11:41:42] <Tobbi> grr.
[2016/02/29 11:41:56] <Hume2> ü
[2016/02/29 11:41:58] <Tobbi> mt: They didn't say the last part about accepting SuperTux.
[2016/02/29 11:42:01] <Tobbi> ü?
[2016/02/29 11:42:03] <mt> :(
[2016/02/29 11:42:19] <Hume2> ü for BrmGods.
[2016/02/29 11:42:21] <Tobbi> mt: But I assume they might have said the part about following the brmGods.
[2016/02/29 11:42:26] <Tobbi> haha.
[2016/02/29 11:42:31] <Tobbi> one moment.

[2016/02/29 11:44:32] <Tobbi> Hume2: Do you even understand it?
[2016/02/29 11:44:53] <Hume2> Tobbi: A bit, I've seen a version with English subtitles.
[2016/02/29 11:44:57] <Tobbi> ah.
[2016/02/29 11:45:00] <Tobbi> yeah.
[2016/02/29 11:45:13] <Hume2> You know, I don't understand much when they are speaking too fast.
[2016/02/29 11:45:31] <Hume2> I understand quite well those slower parts.

[2016/02/29 11:48:15] <Hume2> Bernd das Brot uses your private word :P
[2016/02/29 11:48:33] <Tobbi> Hume2: No, he just *sighs*
[2016/02/29 11:48:38] <Tobbi> He doesn't say *sigh*
[2016/02/29 11:48:52] <Hume2> That's true.

[2016/02/29 11:55:00] <Tobbi> Bernd das Brot, yes.

[2016/02/29 12:11:50] <mt> Tobbi: then we'll just make our own sprite

[2016/02/29 12:12:13] <Hume2> "Tux das Brot" or "Bernd das Tux"?
[2016/02/29 12:12:13] <Tobbi> Sounds good.
[2016/02/29 12:12:17] <mt> or, under US law

[2016/02/29 12:13:30] <Tobbi> mt: You know Gnampf? :D
[2016/02/29 12:13:55] <Tobbi> Gnampf is a great name for a GNU.
[2016/02/29 12:14:02] <Hume2> I don't know what it is, but I know that Bernd das Brot was saying this.
[2016/02/29 12:14:19] <Tobbi> Hume2: It doesn't have any meaning.
[2016/02/29 12:14:22] <Tobbi> It's an arbitrary word.
[2016/02/29 12:14:25] <Hume2> *Gnampf is Not Unix.
[2016/02/29 12:14:40] <Hume2> Tobbi: I guessed so.

[2016/02/29 12:32:43] <Hume2> Yeah :D
[2016/02/29 12:33:07] <Hume2> That's very brmbrmsenseful :D
[2016/02/29 12:33:15] <Tobbi> It's brmbrm..brmbrm.
[2016/02/29 12:33:35] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2016/02/29 12:33:58] <Tobbi> Hume2: Actually, saying brmbrm is easier than saying mtmt.
[2016/02/29 12:34:07] <Tobbi> Given the letters themselves.
[2016/02/29 12:34:21] <Hume2> That's true.
[2016/02/29 12:34:56] <Hume2> [brmbrm] is easier to pronounce than [mtmt].
[2016/02/29 12:35:34] <Hume2> [mət mət] is slightly easier.

[2016/02/29 13:07:18] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/02/29 13:07:26] <Tobbi> mt is breaking his own rules.
[2016/02/29 13:07:35] <mt> what rule
[2016/02/29 13:07:37] <leyyin> red_bot, your mama is fat
[2016/02/29 13:07:51] <Tobbi> red_bot, your mama is red.
[2016/02/29 13:07:52] <leyyin> apparently the bot does not have feelings
[2016/02/29 13:08:01] <Tobbi> leyyin: You don't have feelings.

[2016/02/29 13:09:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: Do you know anything re. whether STK will participate in GSOC maybe next year?
[2016/02/29 13:09:23] <Tobbi> I could probably apply as a student.
[2016/02/29 13:09:36] <pentagon> [10supertux] 07Hume2 pushed 1 commit to 09forest 13https://git.io/v2r5c
[2016/02/29 13:09:37] <mt> why did STK not apply this year?
[2016/02/29 13:09:39] <pentagon> [10supertux] 07Hume2 14b3150d0 data/levels/world2: new level: Don't get blown away!
[2016/02/29 13:09:49] <leyyin> not enough mentors
[2016/02/29 13:09:59] <mt> >not enough mentors
[2016/02/29 13:10:02] <Hume2> 3, actually.
[2016/02/29 13:10:06] <Hume2> I think.
[2016/02/29 13:10:09] <mt> I mean, even we found some mentors
[2016/02/29 13:10:14] <Tobbi> new level?
[2016/02/29 13:10:26] <Hume2> Tobbi: Yes, a forest level.
[2016/02/29 13:11:17] <Hume2> I know that this one is a bit weaker, but still the wind can be quite funny.
[2016/02/29 13:11:29] <Tobbi> I|ll check it out.
[2016/02/29 13:12:10] <Hume2> I'll try to not be a de-mentor :D
[2016/02/29 13:12:39] <Tobbi> Hume2: Don't worry, I'll do "expecto patronum" if necessary
[2016/02/29 13:14:38] <Hume2> What will happen when the mentor doesn't pass his evaluations?
[2016/02/29 13:14:56] <Tobbi> Hume2: We'll be in bad standing and won't get accepted agian.
[2016/02/29 13:15:01] <leyyin> the student becomes feral
[2016/02/29 13:15:29] <Hume2> One more reason why to not become a de-mentor.
[2016/02/29 13:15:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: He becomes a vicious animal, such as a marten?
[2016/02/29 13:16:25] <Hume2> I'm still wonder why Google does this action.
[2016/02/29 13:16:47] <Hume2> It's good that they do that, but I'm wonder why.
[2016/02/29 13:17:46] <leyyin> support open source
[2016/02/29 13:17:52] <leyyin> and when you become an intern
[2016/02/29 13:17:58] <leyyin> you can't contribute to open source
[2016/02/29 13:18:05] <leyyin> without their approval
[2016/02/29 13:18:07] <leyyin> logic :D
[2016/02/29 13:18:30] <Hume2> That seems scary.
[2016/02/29 13:18:39] <leyyin> it is
[2016/02/29 13:19:06] <Hume2> ...but how can they forbide me to contribute to open source?
[2016/02/29 13:19:35] <leyyin> you must submit your patch to them, before allowing you to send the patch to the public repo
[2016/02/29 13:19:49] <leyyin> and after some time, if you commit to the same project you will have a free pass

[2016/02/29 13:20:14] <leyyin> communism anyone?
[2016/02/29 13:20:54] <Hume2> I think that totality still exists in those countries.
[2016/02/29 13:21:33] <Hume2> Well, it's just my opinion.
[2016/02/29 13:21:35] <mt> Hume2: did you happen to break something
[2016/02/29 13:21:39] <mt> [WARNING] /home/mteufel/src/games/Tux/supertux/src/supertux/sector.cpp:172 Error running script: Squirrel error: Couldn't start script (the index 'add_key' does not exist)
[2016/02/29 13:21:56] <Tobbi> mt: Someone in #gsoc said that we should probably have some kind of coding challenge for students.
[2016/02/29 13:21:57] <Hume2> mt: I'll look into it.
[2016/02/29 13:22:12] <mt> Tobbi: like something very hard
[2016/02/29 13:22:17] <mt> or like, a competition
[2016/02/29 13:22:31] <Tobbi> mt: Something that verifies the student is fit for the stuff.
[2016/02/29 13:22:36] <Hume2> Well, make the editor working, that is a challenge.
[2016/02/29 13:22:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: Something smaller that doesn't take all eternity.
[2016/02/29 13:22:56] <Tobbi> First filter for students.
[2016/02/29 13:23:19] <Tobbi> 37 minutes.
[2016/02/29 13:23:36] <Hume2> I'm getting more and more thrilled…
[2016/02/29 13:23:53] <Tobbi> Hume2: Maybe we won't get accepted.
[2016/02/29 13:24:04] <Tobbi> Someone said that games are a more competitive field in GSoC
[2016/02/29 13:24:14] <Tobbi> I have a feeling we probably won't.
[2016/02/29 13:24:21] <Tobbi> And I'd be okay with that.
[2016/02/29 13:24:25] <Hume2> OK, that thrills me more.
[2016/02/29 13:24:25] <Tobbi> Less stuff to mentor for me.
[2016/02/29 13:24:30] <Tobbi> Hume2: Why?
[2016/02/29 13:24:38] <Tobbi> Not getting excepted is not thrilling.
[2016/02/29 13:24:44] <Tobbi> Everything will stay as it is.
[2016/02/29 13:24:54] <Hume2> It's comming, I feel that.
[2016/02/29 13:25:05] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/29 13:25:11] <Hume2> 35 minutes…
[2016/02/29 13:25:28] <Tobbi> Hume2: I am more excited about the mentor meeting. In case we get accepted, I might be able to make a good impression so that Google hires me :D
[2016/02/29 13:25:33] <leyyin> .wakemeup 35 minutes
[2016/02/29 13:25:45] <Hume2> Mentor meeting?
[2016/02/29 13:25:56] <Tobbi> Hume2: You know: The mentor meeting in MV I told you about.
[2016/02/29 13:26:02] <leper`> leyyin: Command understood
[2016/02/29 13:26:14] <leyyin> even lepers are becoming bots!
[2016/02/29 13:26:20] <Tobbi> leper`: You have an awful latency.
[2016/02/29 13:26:24] <Hume2> Tobbi: Is the mouth needed for that?
[2016/02/29 13:26:24] <leyyin> what has the world become
[2016/02/29 13:26:43] <leper`> Tobbi: Donate to improve this bot!
[2016/02/29 13:26:55] <Tobbi> Hume2: A mouth? For a meeting?

[2016/02/29 13:27:17] <leyyin> congrats sydney_untangle
[2016/02/29 13:27:20] <Hume2> Tobbi: There are two ways for comunicating: Keyboard and mouth.
[2016/02/29 13:27:38] <Tobbi> leyyin: What are you congratulating him for?
[2016/02/29 13:27:46] <leyyin> congrats Tobbi
[2016/02/29 13:27:48] <Tobbi> Hume2: Communicating in the Mentor summit? Both.
[2016/02/29 13:27:53] <Tobbi> leyyin: Stop.
[2016/02/29 13:27:58] <Hume2> Mist!
[2016/02/29 13:28:04] <mt> Tobbi: didn't they already want you to apply for a job at them?
[2016/02/29 13:28:22] <mt> (re Google hiring you)
[2016/02/29 13:28:28] <Tobbi> mt: Yes, but I didn't get accepted.
[2016/02/29 13:28:40] <Tobbi> Because I probably just listed my skills, not my problem solving abilities.
[2016/02/29 13:28:44] <Tobbi> At least that's what I expect.
[2016/02/29 13:28:47] <Hume2> Why the hell do they need me speaking? Can't they just read what I write?
[2016/02/29 13:28:49] <Tobbi> *suspect.
[2016/02/29 13:28:49] <leyyin> google is not that great
[2016/02/29 13:28:52] <leyyin> just another big company
[2016/02/29 13:28:57] <Tobbi> I imagine.
[2016/02/29 13:29:09] <Tobbi> I am really uncertain whether working at Google is really what I want.
[2016/02/29 13:29:19] <Tobbi> It'd be prestigious, but apart from that...
[2016/02/29 13:29:47] <leyyin> not if you work in Sillicon Valley
[2016/02/29 13:30:01] <leyyin> ah, you work at Google, cool, I work at NASA
[2016/02/29 13:30:11] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yeah, probably not.
[2016/02/29 13:30:25] <leyyin> everyone has 200k $ salaries down there
[2016/02/29 13:30:29] <leyyin> no one is impressed anymore
[2016/02/29 13:30:31] <Tobbi> leyyin: Actually, more stress in my life is the least I want.
[2016/02/29 13:30:36] <Tobbi> I want to chill out.
[2016/02/29 13:30:48] <Tobbi> So, after my masters degree, I want to take it easy, maybe do something different for a while.
[2016/02/29 13:30:59] <Tobbi> I am currently fairly fed up with stuff.
[2016/02/29 13:31:19] <Hume2> 29 minutes …
[2016/02/29 13:31:34] <Tobbi> Hume2: ... stop
[2016/02/29 13:31:40] <Hume2> OK
[2016/02/29 13:31:44] <mt> Tobbi: go to africa and teach some children how to code
[2016/02/29 13:31:44] <Tobbi> I am excited as well...but not *as* excited.
[2016/02/29 13:31:52] <leyyin> Tobbi, has 2 commands, sigh and STOP

[2016/02/29 13:38:45] <leyyin> leper`, 0 AD, GSOC?
[2016/02/29 13:38:45] <Hume2> leyyin: Won't you mind celebrating the new years' eve on Kepler-79b?

[2016/02/29 13:40:10] <leper`> gah
[2016/02/29 13:40:37] <leyyin> who would mentor?
[2016/02/29 13:40:59] <Hume2> Possibly me, Tobbi and Mathnerd.
[2016/02/29 13:41:16] <leper`> yep
[2016/02/29 13:41:30] <Tobbi> Hume2: I believe, they're talking about 0 AD.
[2016/02/29 13:41:49] <Hume2> How do you know that?
[2016/02/29 13:42:08] <leyyin> Hume2, he can read minds, he is a robot
[2016/02/29 13:42:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: robots don't read minds.
[2016/02/29 13:42:20] <leper`> He's in our matrix
[2016/02/29 13:42:21] <Tobbi> I know that.
[2016/02/29 13:42:36] <leyyin> Tobbi, you are trying to deceive us
[2016/02/29 13:42:41] <leyyin> leper`, you would mentor :D
[2016/02/29 13:43:09] <Tobbi> leyyin: Who am I to do such a thing.
[2016/02/29 13:44:09] <Hume2> GSoC, doesn't it resemble you anything, leyyin?
[2016/02/29 13:44:14] <leper`> leyyin: given current lack of motivation to even complain about commits...
[2016/02/29 13:44:22] <leper`> (and no time when that would be needed for that)
[2016/02/29 13:44:51] <sydney_untangle> Any news on GSoC yet?
[2016/02/29 13:44:56] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: STFU.
[2016/02/29 13:44:57] <Tobbi> ffs.
[2016/02/29 13:44:59] <leyyin> Hume2, resemble, what?
[2016/02/29 13:45:00] <Hume2> 15 minutes …
[2016/02/29 13:45:02] <Tobbi> 15 more minutes.
[2016/02/29 13:45:08] <Hume2> leyyin: Just say it.
[2016/02/29 13:45:16] <leyyin> say what
[2016/02/29 13:45:26] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Honestly, we have been talking about GSOC for the past 2-3 hours.
[2016/02/29 13:45:33] <Hume2> leyyin: The word that is most similar to it.
[2016/02/29 13:45:44] <leyyin> GHCQ?
[2016/02/29 13:45:47] <sydney_untangle> :D
[2016/02/29 13:46:08] <leyyin> GCHQ
[2016/02/29 13:46:09] <Hume2> Achievement get: Don't metion politics :D
[2016/02/29 13:46:19] <sydney_untangle> So, while everyone is being social, what should i do with this antique desktop of mine that costs me 100$/y to run?

[2016/02/29 13:46:50] <leyyin> it costs you 100$/year to run a computer, what?

[2016/02/29 13:47:42] <mt> he'll happily forward it to poor children in Uganda
[2016/02/29 13:48:07] <Tobbi> They can use it to store their squirrels.

[2016/02/29 13:48:48] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, if you run it daily, doubtful
[2016/02/29 13:48:53] <sydney_untangle> I stopped using it for day-to-day use about 4 months ago. :D
[2016/02/29 13:49:00] <sydney_untangle> Now it sits in my closet...
[2016/02/29 13:49:16] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: It would probably work for all 20 years if i let it run 24/7 the whole time...
[2016/02/29 13:49:36] <mt> I've got so many computers I don't use anymore
[2016/02/29 13:49:47] <mt> but they're too loud to run them as servers
[2016/02/29 13:49:59] <sydney_untangle> mt: Care to donate a few? I have a server i should replace...
[2016/02/29 13:50:01] <sydney_untangle> :p
[2016/02/29 13:50:09] <Tobbi> 10 minutes!
[2016/02/29 13:50:16] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Why not use a rbpi?
[2016/02/29 13:50:22] <Tobbi> Much less energy...
[2016/02/29 13:50:31] <sydney_untangle> That one only costs me 40$/year, but it holds my backups, so im satisfied.
[2016/02/29 13:50:34] <mt> sydney_untangle: e.g. that old PowerMac G4 (don't worry, you can use OpenBSD or Gentoo on it)
[2016/02/29 13:50:59] <mt> when it starts up, it plays the mac startup sound
[2016/02/29 13:51:00] <sydney_untangle> mt: Cool. Ive yet to touch a macintosh system with linux...
[2016/02/29 13:51:08] <mt> so loud that you can wake up an entire house
[2016/02/29 13:51:11] <sydney_untangle> Ugg, i hate that. the newer macs still do. ;p
[2016/02/29 13:51:19] <mt> and then, the fans turn on
[2016/02/29 13:51:28] <mt> almost as loud as that startup sound
[2016/02/29 13:51:43] <mt> sydney_untangle: I actually like it
[2016/02/29 13:51:48] <sydney_untangle> :-)
[2016/02/29 13:51:56] <mt> it's like, your computer says "Good morning, how can I help you?"
[2016/02/29 13:52:23] <Hume2> Definitely more polite than Windows :D
[2016/02/29 13:52:31] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: An RPI cannot hold 3 HDDs. If you buy me a new HDD that can store all that info, i'd love to switch.
[2016/02/29 13:52:37] <Hume2> Windows forces you to welcome it :P
[2016/02/29 13:52:55] <sydney_untangle> mt: Tell your linux box to play a sound when you start it. ;p
[2016/02/29 13:52:59] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: It can. You just need to name your child "A RPI" and wait for it to grow p.
[2016/02/29 13:53:02] <Tobbi> up
[2016/02/29 13:53:30] <sydney_untangle> If you buy this old computer for 50$ i shall buy an RPI. :D

[2016/02/29 14:00:00] <leper`> true, but then you have to factor the cost of that in too
[2016/02/29 14:00:16] <leper`> (and depending on what you want to do something else might be the better choice)

[2016/02/29 14:11:30] <sydney_untangle> mt: The raspberry pi idea is fine, but i would have to buy a 2tb HDD if i wanted to give up on my server.
[2016/02/29 14:11:40] <sydney_untangle> So not as affordable.
[2016/02/29 14:12:04] <sydney_untangle> Plus all of the stuff to power the RPI...
[2016/02/29 14:12:20] <leyyin> hahaha "People who work or have worked for Microsoft should probably not participate" https://wiki.winehq.org/Summer_Of_Code#Beware_of_Legal_Requirements

[2016/03/01 11:44:51] <Hume2> Hello
[2016/03/01 11:45:34] <Hume2> The electricity was turned off when it was 19:55.
[2016/03/01 11:45:59] <Hume2> That's why I wasn't there when we received that we haven't succeeded.
[2016/03/01 11:51:50] <Hume2> I saw juat a strong light from the window for a moment and everything shutting down.
[2016/03/01 11:53:05] <sydney_untangle> Hume2: Ouch.
[2016/03/01 11:53:21] <sydney_untangle> Hume2: Thunder storm? Or did a transformer explode?
[2016/03/01 11:53:44] <Hume2> sydney_untangle: It was snowing strongly.
[2016/03/01 11:54:01] <Hume2> It was quite weird.
[2016/03/01 11:54:19] <Hume2> It started with a rain, then it turned to snow.
[2016/03/01 11:54:46] <Tobbi> hello.
[2016/03/01 11:55:00] <Tobbi> And then it turned into kugelblitz?
[2016/03/01 11:55:17] <Hume2> I'm not sure what exactly happened.
[2016/03/01 11:55:56] <Hume2> I just saw the light everywhere in the window.

[2016/03/01 11:56:26] <Hume2> It made a noise like a flash, but I didn't see any other flash.
[2016/03/01 11:58:00] <Tobbi> Hume2: Better flash than fleshlight.
[2016/03/01 11:58:04] <Tobbi> eeh, nvm that.
[2016/03/01 11:58:53] <Tobbi> Hume2: if you want, you can participate to the smart tiles thing. You know the syntax by now.
[2016/03/01 12:00:20] <Hume2> Tobbi: That suggests me that I could finally start to study the flexlay code :P
[2016/03/01 12:00:46] <Tobbi> Hume2: It's not hard, you just need to know python....and need to be a magician.
[2016/03/01 12:00:53] <sydney_untangle> Hume2: Ah, well it is snowing very strongly now.
[2016/03/01 12:01:50] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Snow is falling all around me, children playing, having fun, it's the season for love and understnading, happy March everyone.
[2016/03/01 12:02:51] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: o_O
[2016/03/01 12:03:03] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: no, there's no snow falling here in Germanz.
[2016/03/01 12:03:04] <Tobbi> Germany
[2016/03/01 12:06:23] <Hume2> Achievement get: Run Flexlay :P
[2016/03/01 12:08:00] <Tobbi> Hume2: Which branch?
[2016/03/01 12:08:11] <Hume2> Tobbi: master
[2016/03/01 12:08:16] <Tobbi> Hume2: *sigh*
[2016/03/01 12:08:20] <Tobbi> Hume2: Try develop
[2016/03/01 12:08:22] <Tobbi> Master is so outdated.
[2016/03/01 12:08:24] <Hume2> OK
[2016/03/01 12:10:52] <Hume2> Sorry, I was on develop.
[2016/03/01 12:11:48] <Tobbi> Ah, okay, so it's fine.
[2016/03/01 12:12:35] <Tobbi> Hume2: So, what do you want to get started on? :P You can check out my smart_tiles branch.
[2016/03/01 12:12:39] <Tobbi> check the diff, one moment.
[2016/03/01 12:12:57] <Hume2> Tobbi: Could you rebase?
[2016/03/01 12:13:06] <Tobbi> Hume2: Against latest master, sure.
[2016/03/01 12:13:10] <Tobbi> eeh, against develop, I mean.
[2016/03/01 12:13:14] <Hume2> on develop?
[2016/03/01 12:14:03] <Hume2> nvm
[2016/03/01 12:14:07] <Tobbi> I have done so.

[2016/03/01 12:14:27] <pentagon> [10flexlay] 07tobbi 1426017f2 Add blue pipe
[2016/03/01 12:15:02] <Tobbi> Hume2: So, the way I imagine it is the following: People select "blue pipe" from the list, then a basic blue pipe appears. And you can use the scroll wheel to make the pipe bigger or smaller.
[2016/03/01 12:15:07] <Tobbi> And clicking will add it to the sector
[2016/03/01 12:15:33] <Hume2> OK, I have to study the code first.
[2016/03/01 12:15:40] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/03/01 12:15:44] <Tobbi> no problem.
[2016/03/01 12:15:52] <Tobbi> Much of it is PyQT stuff.
[2016/03/01 12:16:01] <Tobbi> if you want, join #pyqt
[2016/03/01 12:30:59] <Tobbi> Hume2: Progress on understanding the code?
[2016/03/01 12:34:16] <Hume2> Tobbi: I was now afk.
[2016/03/01 12:34:22] <Tobbi> Ah okay.
[2016/03/01 12:44:50] <Hume2> The code doesn't seem hard at all.
[2016/03/01 12:48:47] <Hume2> Tobbi: I know that I'd possibly figure it myself, but could you get me familiar with that code a bit?
[2016/03/01 12:49:13] <Tobbi> Hume2: Uhm, sure. I just don't know where to start :D
[2016/03/01 12:49:21] <Tobbi> Normally I just look for where something is defined.
[2016/03/01 12:49:52] <Hume2> I know. Let's start with the main gui.
[2016/03/01 12:50:34] <Hume2> Tobbi: Isn't it the editor_map_widget by the chance?
[2016/03/01 12:50:56] <Tobbi> Hume2: editor_map_widget is the overview widget on the bottom right
[2016/03/01 12:51:21] <Hume2> oops
[2016/03/01 12:51:58] <Hume2> Tobbi: Where are the clicks proccessed?
[2016/03/01 12:52:35] <Tobbi> Hume2: In the individual widget codes.
[2016/03/01 12:52:43] <Tobbi> Hume2: Which clicks are we talking about,.
[2016/03/01 12:52:44] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/03/01 12:53:13] <Hume2> Tobbi: When I click the mouse, where is it proccessed first?
[2016/03/01 12:53:26] <Tobbi> Hume2: That depends on the widget you click on.
[2016/03/01 12:53:42] <Hume2> OK.
[2016/03/01 12:53:58] <Hume2> And in which widget is the tilemap shown?
[2016/03/01 12:54:26] <Tobbi> Hume2: You mean the tile selection?
[2016/03/01 12:54:37] <Hume2> No, I mean the level.
[2016/03/01 12:54:47] <Tobbi> Ah, one moment.
[2016/03/01 12:54:56] <Tobbi> Oh, that might actually be editor_map_widget.
[2016/03/01 12:55:26] <Tobbi> https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/blob/develop/flexlay/editor_map.py
[2016/03/01 12:56:39] <Hume2> It seems reasonable.

[2016/03/02 11:48:43] <Tobbi> Hume2: I saw that.
[2016/03/02 11:48:57] <Hume2> I'll lock the conversation.

[2016/03/02 11:50:40] <Tobbi> Look, mt is awake.
[2016/03/02 11:50:45] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/02 11:50:50] <mt> did we get any further in preparing 0.4.1
[2016/03/02 11:51:03] <Tobbi> mt: nope, unfortunately not.
[2016/03/02 11:51:07] <Tobbi> Not from my side. I'm working on different things.
[2016/03/02 11:51:14] <mt> btw, if people want to get done with the freenode group thing
[2016/03/02 11:51:21] <mt> feel free to annoy giby now
[2016/03/02 11:51:36] <mt> esp. those who want a supertux/ cloak
[2016/03/02 11:51:39] <Tobbi> mt: So, group registration is open now?
[2016/03/02 11:51:45] <Tobbi> giby: *annoy*
[2016/03/02 11:52:04] <mt> GMS isn't open
[2016/03/02 11:52:23] <mt> but, inofficially, people can apparently ask staff for project cloaks of projects registered after the old group registration was closed
[2016/03/02 11:52:39] <Tobbi> Sounds good.
[2016/03/02 11:52:51] <Tobbi> But it has to be a channel founder, right?
[2016/03/02 11:53:38] <mt> I don't really know
[2016/03/02 11:54:10] <mt> Maybe being someone who's affiliated very closely with the project works too
[2016/03/02 11:54:10] <Tobbi> So, we should ask.
[2016/03/02 11:54:10] <mt> But that's already been proven for the channel founder
[2016/03/02 11:58:18] <mt> (Tobbi: I'd actually ask a staffer on '/stats p')
[2016/03/02 11:58:18] <Hume2> Tobbi: Scaling by wheel doesn't work.
[2016/03/02 11:58:18] <Tobbi> mt: using PM?
[2016/03/02 11:58:18] <mt> yes
[2016/03/02 11:58:22] <Tobbi> alright.
[2016/03/02 11:58:42] <mt> because I've actually seen some project cloaks of projects
[2016/03/02 11:58:54] <mt> that registered after GRF (group registration form) closed
[2016/03/02 11:58:59] <Tobbi> I see...
[2016/03/02 12:00:01] <Hume2> Tobbi: Using fill tool can't be undone.

[2016/03/02 12:02:54] <Tobbi> Yes, I will.
[2016/03/02 12:03:13] <giby> I guess you'll do better without me
[2016/03/02 12:03:27] <Tobbi> giby: What do you mean?
[2016/03/02 12:03:44] <Hume2> Tobbi: Or another question: What is it supposed to do?
[2016/03/02 12:03:44] <Tobbi> Hume2: I don't know yet.
[2016/03/02 12:03:44] <mt> giby: well, that's why we asked you to give one of us founder status here
[2016/03/02 12:03:49] <mt> so we can manage that more easily
[2016/03/02 12:04:44] <giby> I'm just the founder of the irc channel... nothing else :p
[2016/03/02 12:05:15] <leyyin> I see only one solution
[2016/03/02 12:05:20] <leyyin> revolt and detrone giby
[2016/03/02 12:06:01] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/03/02 12:07:01] <Tobbi> And yes, that deserves a sigh.
[2016/03/02 12:07:01] <giby> I'm not on the throne, actually Tobbi has got about as many admin rights that I have :p
[2016/03/02 12:07:01] <Tobbi> Except for the founder status.
[2016/03/02 12:07:40] <giby> Foudre status just allows me to give a founder stats and close the channel
[2016/03/02 12:08:03] <mt> and it makes you the person actually responsible for communication with freenode staff
[2016/03/02 12:08:04] <leyyin> I say do not give that kind of power to Tobbi
[2016/03/02 12:08:08] <leyyin> he will close the channel :P
[2016/03/02 12:08:57] <giby> Yes, but as if we need to communicate with them,  it would be after a meeting, so...
[2016/03/02 12:09:53] <giby> and in case something turns wrong with me, Tobbi will inheritate the founder status anyway
[2016/03/02 12:10:01] <Hume2> Also you can use … instead of three dots :P
[2016/03/02 12:10:16] <giby>  ?
[2016/03/02 12:10:17] <mt> giby: nope, freenode-staff will inherit the channel
[2016/03/02 12:10:28] <mt> giby: successor status is ignored for single-# channels on freenode
[2016/03/02 12:10:46] <giby> Oh?
[2016/03/02 12:11:00] <mt> giby: and no, sometimes it makes sense to make a small decision that still requires talking with staff
[2016/03/02 12:11:29] <mt> where it's not really practical to summon all people, even if they're not on IRC that often
[2016/03/02 12:12:09] <giby> If tobbi needs to make a simple stuff, he can send me a message

[2016/03/02 12:16:11] <Tobbi> It...does...not...matter.
[2016/03/02 12:16:38] <Hume2> Tobbi: It works.
[2016/03/02 12:16:45] <Tobbi> Hume2: Great.
[2016/03/02 12:17:33] <Tobbi> giby: I honestly don't see *why* you don't want to give us or at least one of us founder status. This IRC channel is not your domain. It is to support the project. And the people who actively contribute to this project and are around most often is currently, me, hume, and mt.
[2016/03/02 12:18:12] <Tobbi> It's not like owning an IRC channel is any kind of prestige...
[2016/03/02 12:29:42] <Tobbi> Hume2: If you find anything else, do report it.
[2016/03/02 12:29:49] <Tobbi> In the PyQt5 thing.
[2016/03/02 12:30:01] <Hume2> OK
[2016/03/02 12:30:39] <mt> Tobbi: if that staffer you messaged responds, keep us up-to-date
[2016/03/02 12:30:50] <mt> (who did you msg btw?)
[2016/03/02 12:30:54] <Tobbi> mt: He didn't, so far. I checked his away status...
[2016/03/02 12:31:05] <Tobbi> I thought away for 10 minutes means he's just taking a small break.
[2016/03/02 12:31:11] <mt> "my idle time is a lie"
[2016/03/02 12:31:11] <Tobbi> I /msg'ed tinyhippo
[2016/03/02 12:31:32] <mt> they indeed seem to have removed their +H status (on /stats p) now
[2016/03/02 12:31:50] <Tobbi> oh.
[2016/03/02 12:32:08] <Tobbi> mt: tinyhippo is not on /stats p anymore, it seems.
[2016/03/02 12:32:15] <Tobbi> So, maybe I should ask someone else.
[2016/03/02 12:32:17] <mt> that's what I said, basically
[2016/03/02 12:32:24] <Tobbi> okay, so another one.
[2016/03/02 12:32:44] <mt> (tell the others that you attempted to ask someone else before, might be better)

[2016/03/02 13:15:50] <Tobbi> Linux?
[2016/03/02 13:15:52] <Hume2> Tobbi: Ubuntu 14.04.
[2016/03/02 13:16:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: When you close it via right-clicking the context menu, do you get the prompt to save the current level twice?
[2016/03/02 13:16:13] <uptime> Hume2: Hello!
[2016/03/02 13:16:36] <Hume2> Tobbi: I'll test

[2016/03/02 13:32:29] <Tobbi> Hume2: You have a logic error. If(retry) doesn't actually retry.
[2016/03/02 13:32:30] <Hume2> Unfortunately, it's quite often nowadays.
[2016/03/02 13:32:34] <Tobbi> Did you intend it to be this way?
[2016/03/02 13:33:01] <Hume2> Well, it worked.
[2016/03/02 13:33:24] <Hume2> I didn't worked before, because it found the directory in the datadit.
[2016/03/02 13:33:42] <Hume2> However, it saves to the userdir.
[2016/03/02 13:33:42] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2016/03/02 13:33:47] <Tobbi> Hume2: I get your reasoning now.
[2016/03/02 13:33:50] <Tobbi> Still weird.
[2016/03/02 13:33:57] <Tobbi> But okay.
[2016/03/02 13:34:00] <Tobbi> Keep it if it works.
[2016/03/02 13:35:04] <Tobbi> Hume2: Isn't that good? We want the levels in the userdir so that the data dir only contains proper levels.
[2016/03/02 13:35:08] <Tobbi> Aka, team levels.
[2016/03/02 13:35:17] <Hume2> I think so.
[2016/03/02 13:35:24] <Tobbi> So, it's fine.
[2016/03/02 13:36:20] <Hume2> The issue was that it was making the directory only when it wassn't neither in the datadir or in the userdir.
[2016/03/02 13:36:42] <Hume2> When it was in only the datadir, it didn't create the direstory.
[2016/03/02 13:37:02] <Tobbi> Weird?
[2016/03/02 13:37:15] <Hume2> So now it tries creating the directory by any circumstances and retries.
[2016/03/02 13:37:26] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/03/02 13:37:31] <Tobbi> Sounds good.
[2016/03/02 13:37:31] <mt> Do we still need editor guide and editor FAQ on the GitHub wiki?
[2016/03/02 13:38:04] <mt> They might be a bit outdated, looking at flexlay and in-game editor progress
[2016/03/02 13:38:23] <mt> and there's still http://dcjtech.info/topic/gaming/#supertux
[2016/03/02 13:38:24] <Hume2> I think we no longer need them.
[2016/03/02 13:38:44] <Hume2> I'd just put some links to the editors' wikis instead.
[2016/03/02 13:38:59] <Tobbi> mt: I'd still like to keep them.
[2016/03/02 13:39:08] <Tobbi> mt: I guess there are a lot of people who use it as a ref.
[2016/03/02 13:39:40] <Hume2> Well, still better outdated stuff than nothing.
[2016/03/02 13:40:16] <Tobbi> I'm very excited about the in game editor, by the way: This is gonna be awesome for 0.5
[2016/03/02 13:41:49] <mt> Indeed, no more having to spend hours explaining people how to install the editor
[2016/03/02 13:42:55] <Tobbi> :)
[2016/03/02 13:43:12] <Tobbi> Will be fun for novice users...and for more advanced things there's always flexlay.
[2016/03/02 13:43:34] <Hume2> mt: I've never considered that, but it's true :)
[2016/03/02 13:44:05] <Tobbi> Hume2: I guess implementing a scripting console is out of scope for the ingame editor, right?
[2016/03/02 13:44:19] <Tobbi> I mean: A script editor thing.
[2016/03/02 13:44:37] <Hume2> Tobbi: It's one of the less-important stuff.
[2016/03/02 13:45:05] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yeah, doesn't matter for now.
[2016/03/02 13:45:41] <Hume2> I have something in https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/269
[2016/03/02 13:46:43] <Tobbi> We can also probably take another .x release to straighten things out and add more features.
[2016/03/02 13:47:16] <Hume2> That's true.
[2016/03/02 13:47:45] <Hume2> Shall we do also some prereleases?
[2016/03/02 13:48:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: Might be good to get some traction.
[2016/03/02 13:48:14] <mt> for bugfix releases not
[2016/03/02 13:48:32] <mt> for new feature releases, yes
[2016/03/02 13:48:32] <Hume2> Yeah, I mean only for the mayor releases.
[2016/03/02 13:48:36] <mt> like, some release candidates
[2016/03/02 13:48:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: We can certainly have release candidates for the editor branch.
[2016/03/02 13:49:09] <Hume2> I think we aren't capable of making candidates.
[2016/03/02 13:49:15] <Tobbi> tbh, I think our GUI interface is too clunky...We need to add some work there as well.
[2016/03/02 13:49:48] <Hume2> I know, the scrolling is terrible.
[2016/03/02 13:49:49] <Tobbi> I know that it might take quite some time...but if we're going to have an ingame editor that looks nice, we should add some work there.
[2016/03/02 13:51:10] <Hume2> For the mayor releases, I think we should include as many features as we can.
[2016/03/02 13:51:37] <Hume2> Like all features those are currently finished.
[2016/03/02 13:51:59] <mt> for the editor branch
[2016/03/02 13:52:05] <mt> I'd actually call it alpha release
[2016/03/02 13:52:11] <Tobbi> Yeah.
[2016/03/02 13:52:14] <mt> or 'development snapshot'
[2016/03/02 13:52:15] <Tobbi> Makes sense.
[2016/03/02 13:52:20] <Hume2> That could be.
[2016/03/02 13:52:50] <Hume2> Like 0.4.0-editor_test?
[2016/03/02 13:53:11] <mt> well, github releases would need a tag
[2016/03/02 13:53:15] <mt> which kind of sucks
[2016/03/02 13:53:23] <mt> because tags are set on a specific commit
[2016/03/02 13:53:29] <mt> they'll be lost when rebasing

[2016/03/02 14:33:56] <Hume2> There is only Google Minus, Google Plus is like Google Minus Minus where the two minuses are crossed :D

[2016/03/02 17:28:15] <Necrosporus> I guess I should somehow go to forest, but how to get there?

[2016/03/02 17:53:10] <Necrosporus> Tobbi, but can I do anything else after I defeat Yeti?
[2016/03/02 17:53:26] <Tobbi> Necrosporus: Not in that level. Did you find the bonus level?
[2016/03/02 17:53:36] <Necrosporus> There should also be a secret somewhere, but how to get to it I have no idea
[2016/03/02 17:53:39] <Necrosporus> yes
[2016/03/02 17:53:58] <Necrosporus> Though I didn't finish with giant hole in that level
[2016/03/02 17:54:04] <Necrosporus> There were four rooms
[2016/03/02 17:54:26] <Tobbi> I don't remember that one.
[2016/03/02 17:54:33] <Necrosporus> Tobbi, in bonus level
[2016/03/02 17:54:38] <Tobbi> Ah...
[2016/03/02 17:54:42] <Tobbi> yeah, but that's boring.
[2016/03/02 17:54:52] <Tobbi> Necrosporus: In that case: Continue with the bonus levels.
[2016/03/02 17:55:09] <Necrosporus> You mean contrib stuff?
[2016/03/02 17:55:30] <Tobbi> Necrosporus: yes.
[2016/03/02 17:55:34] <Tobbi> Also, you have Add-ons.
[2016/03/02 17:55:38] <Tobbi> You can download them.
[2016/03/02 17:56:07] <Necrosporus> There also should be cheats
[2016/03/02 17:56:39] <Tobbi> There are. In developer mode.

[2016/03/02 18:06:56] <Necrosporus> Tobbi, what is earth mode for?
[2016/03/02 18:07:11] <Tobbi> Necrosporus: Not yet used very often.
[2016/03/02 18:07:14] <Necrosporus> And where is the secret in yeti level?
[2016/03/02 18:07:15] <Tobbi> Where did you find it?
[2016/03/02 18:07:20] <Necrosporus> In cheat menu
[2016/03/02 18:07:43] <Tobbi> Necrosporus: It's a fairly new powerup.
[2016/03/02 18:07:47] <Tobbi> I have to look up what it does.
[2016/03/02 18:07:47] <Necrosporus> There is also air, which seem to enchance jumping
[2016/03/02 18:08:00] <Tobbi> Necrosporus: Also, not gonna tell you the yeti secret :P
[2016/03/02 18:08:28] <Necrosporus> Well, but I have tried jumping up to the platform
[2016/03/02 18:08:34] <Necrosporus> It still doesn't help
[2016/03/02 18:08:44] <Tobbi> what platform?
[2016/03/02 18:08:55] <Necrosporus> Two ones where yeti stands
[2016/03/02 18:09:03] <Necrosporus> On both sides
[2016/03/02 18:10:29] <Necrosporus> Also killing it is quite easy once you learn how to do it. Just stand in the middle, when ice pikes fall, move away, let them fall and go back, then jump on the yeti while it walks through the middle, this way it's fairly easy
[2016/03/02 18:10:44] <Necrosporus> Though it's sad that fire and Ice does nothing to it
[2016/03/02 18:12:54] <Necrosporus> Is there a way to enable permanent star mode?
[2016/03/02 18:13:05] <giby> we would like a star on the yeti :p

[2016/03/02 18:20:58] <Necrosporus> Tobbi, ok, I have looked into yeti level source... Well, I still doubt that it's possible to get to that secret without Air, and is there a single air bonus in story levels?
[2016/03/02 18:21:29] <Tobbi> Necrosporus: You need to stay on the yeti's head.
[2016/03/02 18:21:38] <Necrosporus> Yeah, I see
[2016/03/02 18:21:46] <Tobbi> Necrosporus: No, air bonus isn't yet in the main levels. it's a fairly recent addition to the source.
[2016/03/02 18:22:06] <Necrosporus> I was able to get to the secret with the air bonus
[2016/03/02 18:22:53] <Necrosporus> Also I found a non-advertised feature that an ice pike could freeze enemies
[2016/03/02 18:23:03] <Necrosporus> Though what to do with them after freezing?

[2016/03/02 18:33:48] <sydney_untangle> Necrosporus: Jump on them.
[2016/03/02 18:34:07] <sydney_untangle> Necrosporus: Well, it matters on what they are. Probably don't touch them.
[2016/03/02 18:35:51] <Necrosporus> Seems that iceballs give same effect
[2016/03/02 18:36:14] <Necrosporus> Though there's probably still no way to get ice bonus in story levels without cheating

[2016/03/02 18:36:44] <Necrosporus> sydney_untangle, grab them and drop into a pit
[2016/03/02 18:37:13] <Necrosporus> or put a frozen bomb next to some enemy and jump on it
[2016/03/02 18:37:15] <Tobbi> Why do you need ice bonus in story levels?
[2016/03/02 18:37:38] <Necrosporus> To freeze rolling suns
[2016/03/02 18:37:54] <Necrosporus> There seem no other way to destroy them
[2016/03/02 18:38:36] @ irungentoo joined channel #supertux
[2016/03/02 18:42:14] <Necrosporus> Tobbi, is it a bug that if you drop an ice cube into a pit one cell wide, it will destroy itself?
[2016/03/02 18:42:29] <Tobbi> Sounds like intended behaviour.
[2016/03/02 18:42:38] <Necrosporus> It's possible to do in the castle, at the very beginning
[2016/03/02 18:44:25] <Necrosporus> Tobbi, but in the story mode you can't save Penny
[2016/03/02 18:44:29] <Necrosporus> can you?
[2016/03/02 18:44:39] <Tobbi> Necrosporus: Oh, no you can't.
[2016/03/02 18:44:53] <Necrosporus> Can you do it at all?
[2016/03/02 18:44:55] <Tobbi> In the early days we had a continuous storyline.
[2016/03/02 18:45:12] <Necrosporus> I'm playing 0.4.0
[2016/03/02 18:47:26] <Tobbi> With a note that tux finds in the castle.
[2016/03/02 18:47:27] <Tobbi> Somehow this was dropped.
[2016/03/02 18:47:27] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Should we reinstate that? ^^
[2016/03/02 18:47:27] <giby> Necrosporus, please notice it is still in dev so Penny isn't there out of the intro
[2016/03/02 18:47:27] <Necrosporus> giby, isn't 0.4.0 stable
[2016/03/02 18:47:27] <Necrosporus> I though it's next stable version after 0.1.3
[2016/03/02 18:47:27] <Tobbi> Necrosporus: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/src/badguy/walking_badguy.cpp#L205 re badguys falling.
[2016/03/02 18:47:27] <Tobbi> Necrosporus: 0.4.0 is "fairly stable".
[2016/03/02 18:47:27] <Tobbi> You sound like Savsish.
[2016/03/02 18:47:27] <Tobbi> "Why release 0.4.0 when there are still untranslated strings in common languages like occitan"
[2016/03/02 18:47:56] <Necrosporus> occitan?
[2016/03/02 18:47:56] <Tobbi> You don't know it? How can you not know it?
[2016/03/02 18:51:08] <Tobbi> It's spoken by...idk, let me check.
[2016/03/02 18:51:08] <Necrosporus> Actually I doubt that translation is useful
[2016/03/02 18:51:08] <Tobbi> 100k to 800k people.
[2016/03/02 18:51:08] <Tobbi> Necrosporus: What do you mean?
[2016/03/02 18:51:08] <Necrosporus> I mean, I doubt that translations are useful
[2016/03/02 18:51:08] <Necrosporus> There is almost no text
[2016/03/02 18:51:08] <Tobbi> Necrosporus: There is menu text...
[2016/03/02 18:51:08] <Tobbi> And dialog.
[2016/03/02 18:51:08] <Tobbi> And level names.
[2016/03/02 18:51:08] <Necrosporus> And words like "Start", "Pause" and stuff are not that hard to learn even if you do not know english
[2016/03/02 18:51:08] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/03/02 18:51:08] <Necrosporus> Well, OK, translations might be useful for certain people
[2016/03/02 18:51:39] <Tobbi> I'm off...good night.
[2016/03/02 18:52:01] <giby> Necrosporus, it is stable, but still incomplete :p you'll see Penny in 1.0.0 :p

[2016/03/03 07:11:20] <giby_the_kid> Hi Tobbi
[2016/03/03 07:11:29] <Tobbi> Hey, Tobbi.
[2016/03/03 07:11:30] <giby_the_kid> It works
[2016/03/03 07:11:40] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: I can see that, indeed. We should ask the rest of the team whether they want a cloak.
[2016/03/03 07:11:46] <Tobbi> I'll do that in the afternoon.
[2016/03/03 07:12:09] <giby_the_kid> so I just use a stupid one to test if it works
[2016/03/03 07:16:06] <mt> hi
[2016/03/03 07:16:18] <mt> I see you've got cloaks now
[2016/03/03 07:16:32] <mt> For now, I probably don't want one
[2016/03/03 07:16:54] <Tobbi> mt: Alright! I'll ask the rest of the team later in the afternoon.
[2016/03/03 07:17:06] <Tobbi> But if you change your mind, just let me know.
[2016/03/03 07:17:38] <mt> Even though I actually could get atheme/supertux.mteufel or supertux/atheme.mteufel if whoever's group contact now approves
[2016/03/03 07:17:58] <mt> (still read this as a 'no' for now)

[2016/03/03 07:19:54] <giby_the_kid> we should maybe discuss what is legit
[2016/03/03 07:20:06] <mt> staffer's aren't all too happy about people constantly changing cloaks
[2016/03/03 07:20:31] <mt> what I personally think is that it shouldn't be restricted like 'there's only two cloaks'
[2016/03/03 07:21:25] <mt> supertux/<name on github, irc, or elsewhere> and supertux/<role>/<name on github, irc, or elsewhere> looks okay and isn't that insane
[2016/03/03 07:22:26] <mt> also, giby, since freenode advises channel ops to not use ops permanently, it would be nice if you removed your auto-op flag
[2016/03/03 07:22:54] <mt> auto-voice is still okay so people can see your affiliation with the project

[2016/03/03 08:24:31] <mt> I forgot that the More than x thing gets sent for all commits
[2016/03/03 08:24:37] <mt> not for the first only
[2016/03/03 08:24:37] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2016/03/03 08:24:44] <mt> now it entirely ignores it
[2016/03/03 08:25:05] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2016/03/03 08:25:21] <mt> (the (force-)pushed x commits will still appear)
[2016/03/03 08:26:07] <Tobbi> I should host a bot on my rbpi that says "All hail thy Tobbi" whenever I push something.

[2016/03/03 08:28:14] <mt> hello Hume2
[2016/03/03 08:28:21] <Hume2> Hello, mt
[2016/03/03 08:28:39] <mt> so we've got some cloaks now (whois Tobbi for an example), you can have one too I guess
[2016/03/03 08:29:01] <mt> and we just right now fixed the thing that listed 87 commits when you force push
[2016/03/03 08:29:53] @ irungentoo joined channel #supertux
[2016/03/03 08:30:14] <Tobbi> mt: So you cannot make it list the first 5 commits, and then say "...and x more..."?
[2016/03/03 08:30:27] <mt> no
[2016/03/03 08:30:33] <mt> not without changing the code
[2016/03/03 08:30:48] <Tobbi> mt: But you just changed the code, didn't you?
[2016/03/03 08:30:53] <mt> no
[2016/03/03 08:30:56] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2016/03/03 08:31:05] <pentagon> [10supertux] 07Hume2 04force-pushed 87 commits to 09editor 13https://git.io/v2D99
[2016/03/03 08:31:20] <mt> basically, there's a config option that allows customizing the notifications
[2016/03/03 08:31:29] <mt> and that also allows limited commands
[2016/03/03 08:31:43] <Tobbi> I see. Makes sense.
[2016/03/03 08:31:52] <mt> I just added an if condition
[2016/03/03 08:31:56] <Tobbi> Hume2: So, do you want a cloak?
[2016/03/03 08:32:06] <mt> The thing is, I can't store a variable per push
[2016/03/03 08:32:16] <mt> I can store one globally in the bot
[2016/03/03 08:32:16] <Hume2> Tobbi: What cloak?
[2016/03/03 08:32:19] <mt> but that's ugly
[2016/03/03 08:32:34] <mt> Hume2: like supertux/Hume2
[2016/03/03 08:32:37] <Tobbi> yes.
[2016/03/03 08:32:39] <mt> as hostname
[2016/03/03 08:32:49] <Tobbi> I have @supertux/tobbi
[2016/03/03 08:33:06] <Hume2> Ok, thanks.
[2016/03/03 08:33:12] <Tobbi> Is that a yes?
[2016/03/03 08:33:17] <Hume2> Yes, it is.
[2016/03/03 08:33:20] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2016/03/03 08:33:24] <mt> recommended reading: https://gist.github.com/maxteufel/1e2cf7ada079c271bd3c
[2016/03/03 08:33:30] <Tobbi> So, I guess I'll just wait for sydney_u1tangle to show up...
[2016/03/03 08:33:36] <Tobbi> Did I forget anyone?
[2016/03/03 08:35:35] <mt> of those in here, I don't think so
[2016/03/03 08:35:49] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/03/03 08:36:16] <Tobbi> Hume2: So, do you want @supertux/Hume or @supertux/Hume2 or what do you prefer?
[2016/03/03 08:36:32] <Tobbi> giby has @supertux/guru/giby
[2016/03/03 08:36:35] <Tobbi> fwiw
[2016/03/03 08:36:35] <Hume2> Tobbi: @supertux/Hume2
[2016/03/03 08:36:37] <Tobbi> Good.
[2016/03/03 08:36:49] <Tobbi> I'll check with staff once they're available.
[2016/03/03 08:36:52] <mt> Tobbi: fwiw, you can also ask in #freenod
[2016/03/03 08:36:54] <mt> e
[2016/03/03 08:36:54] <Tobbi> I mean: once sydney showed up.
[2016/03/03 08:37:07] <Tobbi> right...
[2016/03/03 08:37:27] <mt> that way, one that sees it earliest will handle the request
[2016/03/03 08:37:52] <mt> also, make sure you have Hume2 confirm it, so they don't have to wait to ask him for confirmation

[2016/03/03 08:40:31] <mt> indeed
[2016/03/03 08:43:15] <mt> Hume2: Tobbi asked for that cloak in freenode, maybe you'd show up there and confirm that
[2016/03/03 08:43:22] <mt> s/freenode/#freenode/
[2016/03/03 08:43:22] <red_bot> mt meant: "Hume2: Tobbi asked for that cloak in #freenode, maybe you'd show up there and confirm that"
[2016/03/03 08:43:57] <Hume2> I'm there.
[2016/03/03 08:44:07] <Tobbi> good
[2016/03/03 08:44:09] <mt> yeah, you'll have to wait until eir voices you

[2016/03/03 08:44:49] <giby_the_kid> Tobbi, give me the summary or send them all at once
[2016/03/03 08:45:08] <mt> yeah, or you have a staffer read the log in here (not all staffers have that though) ;)
[2016/03/03 08:45:25] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: I decided to give Hume2 his cloak sooner rather than later... The only one who's potentially left is sydney_u1tangle
[2016/03/03 08:45:33] <Hume2> OK, I have it.
[2016/03/03 08:45:45] <Hume2> supertux/Hume2 is now your hidden host (set by services.)
[2016/03/03 08:46:17] <mt> what you might notice is that, unlike as for unaffiliated cloaks, the project cloaks also work on gateways
[2016/03/03 08:46:36] <giby_the_kid> well it is just to avoid to annoy free node staff, just give the list at once
[2016/03/03 08:46:47] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: Okay, seems reasonable.
[2016/03/03 08:47:01] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: I didn't forget anyone from the core team, did I?
[2016/03/03 08:47:02] <mt> giby_the_kid: they're not really annoyed
[2016/03/03 08:47:15] <giby_the_kid> either you give it or I do
[2016/03/03 08:47:18] <Hume2> So what does the cloak do by the way?
[2016/03/03 08:47:19] <mt> people ask for cloaks all the time
[2016/03/03 08:47:20] <uptime> giby_the_kid: I am not annoyed that easily! Others maybe but I am not. Feel free to give me them as slow/fast as you get them :)
[2016/03/03 08:47:34] <mt> Hume2: show your affiliation with the project
[2016/03/03 08:47:50] <giby_the_kid> uptime, Ok
[2016/03/03 08:48:20] <mt> Hume2: I already linked to https://gist.github.com/maxteufel/1e2cf7ada079c271bd3c - many people think because a cloak shows up as your hostname it hides your IP - it doesn't
[2016/03/03 08:48:33] <Hume2> So it will show me connected, even when I'm disconnected, right?
[2016/03/03 08:48:38] <mt> no
[2016/03/03 08:48:40] <Tobbi> No, that's a bouncer.
[2016/03/03 08:48:48] <Tobbi> If you want that, get a raspberrypi :)
[2016/03/03 08:49:50] <Tobbi> Or there are other hosters who can host that.
[2016/03/03 08:50:13] <Hume2> So it's only a display tingy, right?
[2016/03/03 08:50:19] <Hume2> *thingy
[2016/03/03 08:50:22] <mt> Tobbi: what about https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/365?
[2016/03/03 08:50:51] <Tobbi> mt: What about it? Still depends on the tinygettext changes. We still don't have all localized names.
[2016/03/03 08:51:26] <Tobbi> Actually...
[2016/03/03 08:51:36] <Tobbi> We have all top level langcodes covered.
[2016/03/03 08:51:38] <Tobbi> We could merge it.
[2016/03/03 08:51:43] <mt> I'd just push what we have for tinygettext#3
[2016/03/03 08:52:05] <Tobbi> mt: You mean merge that? I can do that.
[2016/03/03 08:52:06] <mt> and just make sure it doesn't crash if there's a missing language name localization
[2016/03/03 08:52:15] <mt> yeah
[2016/03/03 08:52:24] <Tobbi> No , it'll just use the English localization then.
[2016/03/03 08:52:29] <Tobbi> Okay, one moment.
[2016/03/03 08:53:19] <leper`> if you depend on icu for something you could just use that for the localized names
[2016/03/03 08:54:24] <mt> also, maybe http://glottolog.org/ can help
[2016/03/03 08:55:57] <Tobbi> Oh.

[2016/03/03 09:03:21] <Tobbi> mt: Some of the strings might not display due to missing glyphs.
[2016/03/03 09:03:59] <Tobbi> I'll check...
[2016/03/03 09:05:22] <mt> Yes
[2016/03/03 09:05:28] <mt> We need TTF/OTF support
[2016/03/03 09:06:09] <mt> maybe we can annoy Benau? Didn't he want to look into it if GSoC won't happen for us
[2016/03/03 09:07:35] <Tobbi> mt: Yes, we could try that...Hopefully, he's not busy.
[2016/03/03 09:09:05] <Tobbi> gargh, now I could need maths22.
[2016/03/03 09:09:11] <Tobbi> Oh, I forgot maths22 and Karkus re cloaks.
[2016/03/03 09:09:17] <Tobbi> Let's ask them when they'll reappar.
[2016/03/03 09:09:20] <Tobbi> *reappear
[2016/03/03 09:09:22] <mt> email them?
[2016/03/03 09:09:29] <Tobbi> I could.

[2016/03/03 09:11:31] <Hume2> I was just testing my keyboard and accidentally pressed enter.
[2016/03/03 09:11:37] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/03 09:11:45] <mt> Hume2: protip: don't test your keyboard in your IRC client
[2016/03/03 09:11:49] <Mathnerd314> Tobbi: I guess, no reason not to
[2016/03/03 09:12:00] <Tobbi> Hume2: I wouldn't be surprised if that is a valid word in Czech.
[2016/03/03 09:12:00] <mt> Hume2: also, don't sleep on your keyboard while your IRC client is active
[2016/03/03 09:12:23] <Tobbi> Also, don't play Schroedinger's keyboard.
[2016/03/03 09:12:27] <Hume2> Tobbi: It's not a valid word, because ṕ doesn't exist in Czech.
[2016/03/03 09:12:30] <Mathnerd314> Tobbi: I saw that Google turned the application down :-)
[2016/03/03 09:12:41] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: yeah, it's a shame.
[2016/03/03 09:12:47] <Tobbi> Now we need to find actual slaves for the work :P

[2016/03/03 09:22:22] <Mathnerd314> and the build system is in Haskell, so it's awesome
[2016/03/03 09:22:55] <mt> please write a script to convert autotools-ish build systems to your awesome build system
[2016/03/03 09:23:33] <Mathnerd314> well, there's a better build system written in Java and a faster one written in C, so first I have to make the build system better than those. but Make is next after that
[2016/03/03 09:23:50] <mt> the thing is
[2016/03/03 09:23:51] <leper`> but it should still check for that one slightly broken linker on that outdated unix version by that one company that was already defunct for more than a decade 1999
[2016/03/03 09:24:23] <mt> porting autotools-ish files to some saner build system (CMake) is a mess
[2016/03/03 09:24:36] <mt> especially if you've never worked with build systems >_>
[2016/03/03 09:25:01] <mt> how nice would it be to run a script that does all the porting magic

[2016/03/03 09:25:25] <leper`> well I guess that is caused by autotools being a mess
[2016/03/03 09:27:17] <Tobbi> What now?
[2016/03/03 09:27:48] <Tobbi> Ah, it couldn't clone.
[2016/03/03 09:27:50] <Tobbi> Sounds okay.

[2016/03/03 09:28:42] <Tobbi> I guess it pretty much depends.
[2016/03/03 09:28:45] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/03/03 09:28:57] <Tobbi> mt: Okay, some glyphs display, and some don't.
[2016/03/03 09:28:58] <uptime> Tobbi - giby_the_kid just one quick thing, if you have any other cloak requests if you could PM me them that'd work a lot better ensuring I don't miss them :)
[2016/03/03 09:29:11] <Tobbi> uptime: Sure thing. :)
[2016/03/03 09:29:24] <giby_the_kid> No trouble
[2016/03/03 09:30:11] <mt> Tobbi: maybe we can ask our font guru ;)
[2016/03/03 09:30:18] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2016/03/03 09:30:26] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: Can you create fonts for us, again?
[2016/03/03 09:30:49] <giby_the_kid> yes
[2016/03/03 09:30:59] <giby_the_kid> which language?
[2016/03/03 09:31:13] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: Let me check.
[2016/03/03 09:31:58] <giby_the_kid> I needed some work on cyrillic but serbian or so hasn't answered, and I was very busy
[2016/03/03 09:32:40] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: Do we have hindi fonts?
[2016/03/03 09:33:15] <giby_the_kid> Hindi use devanagari like nepali and sankrit
[2016/03/03 09:33:22] <Tobbi> Hmm, it doesn't display.
[2016/03/03 09:33:25] <Tobbi> We also need Khmer.
[2016/03/03 09:33:51] <mt> giby_the_kid: we were actually thinking about moving to TTF if you didn't read that yet :)
[2016/03/03 09:33:52] <giby_the_kid> last time I had the diacritic issue with devanagari
[2016/03/03 09:34:10] <Tobbi> Problem is: Coding that *could* be a pain.
[2016/03/03 09:34:31] <mt> Actually I've looked at the STK code
[2016/03/03 09:34:41] <mt> it didn't look like it would be that hard
[2016/03/03 09:34:43] <giby_the_kid> Khmer shouldn't be a trouble, I should just see how far it has been translated
[2016/03/03 09:35:03] <giby_the_kid> Tobbi, I know it is pain
[2016/03/03 09:35:06] <Tobbi> Apparently, it hasn't been translated at all.
[2016/03/03 09:35:14] <Tobbi> mt: Okay...what are they using? Freetype?
[2016/03/03 09:35:22] <mt> freetype yeah
[2016/03/03 09:35:26] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2016/03/03 09:35:33] <Tobbi> We should use some google font and test it.
[2016/03/03 09:35:42] <Tobbi> Didn't we actually decide on one?
[2016/03/03 09:35:45] <giby_the_kid> Heu, for european, we use gimp :p
[2016/03/03 09:35:51] <mt> getting a font to test isn't the problem, Tobbi
[2016/03/03 09:35:55] <Tobbi> I know.
[2016/03/03 09:36:03] <mt> we could just use Comic Sans
[2016/03/03 09:36:07] <Tobbi> mt: No!
[2016/03/03 09:36:17] <Tobbi> Oh, you mean for testing, right.
[2016/03/03 09:36:25] <giby_the_kid> for non asian, I use a cute and free depending on language
[2016/03/03 09:36:52] <Tobbi> This would solve the problem with right-to-left for us as well.
[2016/03/03 09:37:06] <Tobbi> mt: Let's create a branch for that, shall we?
[2016/03/03 09:37:15] <mt> sure
[2016/03/03 09:37:19] <giby_the_kid> I tried to find a tool to convert our font to ttf, but haven't found a reliable soft

[2016/03/03 09:37:37] <mt> giby_the_kid: coding is more of a problem
[2016/03/03 09:37:48] <mt> tbh, I've gotten quite nice results with povtrace
[2016/03/03 09:37:48] <Tobbi> It might or might not be.
[2016/03/03 09:38:11] <Tobbi> Actually, there is SDL_ttf
[2016/03/03 09:38:16] <Tobbi> which uses freetype
[2016/03/03 09:38:21] <giby_the_kid> Well, with SDL2 it could be easier, but we have to give up of STF format
[2016/03/03 09:38:25] <mt> it uses freetype? TIL
[2016/03/03 09:38:53] <Tobbi> I guess?
[2016/03/03 09:38:56] * Tobbi checks.
[2016/03/03 09:39:26] <mt> giby_the_kid: why would we need STF anyway? TTF/OTF does that job
[2016/03/03 09:39:33] <Tobbi> SDL_ttf binaries have been built with the following libraries:
[2016/03/03 09:39:33] <Tobbi>    FreeType 2.4.8
[2016/03/03 09:40:17] <giby_the_kid> mt: STF or supertax font is our native format...
[2016/03/03 09:40:18] <pentagon> [10supertux] 07tobbi created branch 09freetype
[2016/03/03 09:40:30] <mt> Tobbi: https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code/commit/3a5ec83
[2016/03/03 09:40:41] <mt> giby_the_kid: yeah, I know
[2016/03/03 09:40:42] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: Mistakes we did in the past are supposed to be fixed.
[2016/03/03 09:40:51] <mt> Tobbi++
[2016/03/03 09:41:03] <giby_the_kid> we can give a ride of it, but then we should save the font ;)
[2016/03/03 09:41:30] <mt> giby_the_kid: I wouldn't mind actually using a different font that's nice
[2016/03/03 09:41:37] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2016/03/03 09:41:39] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: We could as well trace it.
[2016/03/03 09:41:42] <mt> giby_the_kid: TTF support > keeping old fonts
[2016/03/03 09:41:52] <Tobbi> vector tracing the font shouldn't be a problem.
[2016/03/03 09:41:55] <mt> because TTF adds native support for special characters
[2016/03/03 09:42:02] <Tobbi> There is fontforge etc.
[2016/03/03 09:42:09] <Tobbi> Plus, actual right-to-left support.
[2016/03/03 09:42:58] <Tobbi> mt: I think our work might be even less than theirs, because we use SDL natively...
[2016/03/03 09:43:00] <Tobbi> And they don't
[2016/03/03 09:43:01] <giby_the_kid> font forge isn't suitable for it, I tried long time ago
[2016/03/03 09:43:02] <Tobbi> They have CEGUI
[2016/03/03 09:43:07] <mt> giby_the_kid: here's a vector traced version: https://ptpb.pw/paiG.svg
[2016/03/03 09:43:10] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: Then just save the image files.
[2016/03/03 09:43:11] <mt> of the current font
[2016/03/03 09:43:33] <mt> that traced version was just made using povtrace
[2016/03/03 09:43:39] <mt> no other work needed
[2016/03/03 09:43:57] <giby_the_kid> It isn't our font!!!
[2016/03/03 09:44:05] <mt> import the glyphs into fontforge, fix up the mistakes made by povtrace
[2016/03/03 09:44:05] <giby_the_kid> and it is incomplete
[2016/03/03 09:44:27] <mt> giby_the_kid: that is white-big.png povtraced, actually
[2016/03/03 09:44:37] <mt> and why do you care so much about our font
[2016/03/03 09:44:58] <giby_the_kid> mt: it is my task
[2016/03/03 09:45:11] <mt> if there's another one that looks nice and works and is appropriately licensed I don't see any difficulties
[2016/03/03 09:47:24] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: You can certainly vector-trace the fonts yourself.
[2016/03/03 09:47:39] <Tobbi> and then create a nice TTF file.
[2016/03/03 09:47:42] <giby_the_kid> I tried to find a tool for this
[2016/03/03 09:47:46] <Tobbi> I'd rather have right-to-left support.
[2016/03/03 09:48:23] <mt> giby_the_kid: what's wrong with the traced SVG I provided?
[2016/03/03 09:48:34] <Tobbi> tracing can be done for the other fonts as well.
[2016/03/03 09:48:53] <giby_the_kid> Sure, once it is working ;)
[2016/03/03 09:49:14] <giby_the_kid> need to be saved: Latin, cyrillic and greek
[2016/03/03 09:49:26] <mt> git saves history anyway
[2016/03/03 09:49:44] <mt> so that's not a big problem to bring back the old fonts
[2016/03/03 09:49:50] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: If you want, checkin the font files into the media repo just to be extra-certain.
[2016/03/03 09:49:51] <mt> even if they've been deleted
[2016/03/03 09:49:58] <Tobbi> We won't force-push...

[2016/03/03 09:54:05] <Tobbi> All things considered, this doesn't look too bad: http://www.willusher.io/sdl2%20tutorials/2013/12/18/lesson-6-true-type-fonts-with-sdl_ttf/
[2016/03/03 09:54:58] <Tobbi> This does actually look pretty easy.
[2016/03/03 09:57:56] <mt> Tobbi: we should think carefully about sdl_ttf or freetype
[2016/03/03 09:58:02] <Tobbi> yes.
[2016/03/03 09:58:06] <mt> according to wikipedia freetype also supports OTF
[2016/03/03 09:58:13] <mt> sdl_ttf only supports TTF
[2016/03/03 09:58:19] <mt> https://superuser.com/questions/96390/difference-between-otf-open-type-or-ttf-true-type-font-formats
[2016/03/03 09:58:30] <Tobbi> I see...
[2016/03/03 09:59:00] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/03/03 10:00:31] <Tobbi> mt: Problem is: It needs to be easy to output to an SDL surface.
[2016/03/03 10:01:13] <mt> isn't the flexibility of freetype worth it?
[2016/03/03 10:01:25] <mt> we can simply switch between ttf and otf
[2016/03/03 10:01:41] <Tobbi> I'll check...
[2016/03/03 10:01:54] <mt> also, don't forget to annoy Benau
[2016/03/03 10:02:26] <Tobbi> Yeah, I'll.
[2016/03/03 10:07:37] <Tobbi> mt: Maybe we should just resort to just using TTF.
[2016/03/03 10:08:29] <Tobbi> I do actually not want to trouble myself with rendering OTF with some arbitrary lib like freetype.
[2016/03/03 10:09:07] <mt> okay
[2016/03/03 10:09:33] <mt> I guess, with sdl_ttf being part of the sdl ecosystem
[2016/03/03 10:09:40] <mt> it's quite easy to integrate it
[2016/03/03 10:09:41] <Tobbi> mt: According to someone in #SDL, SDL does allow OTF

[2016/03/03 13:22:21] <Tobbi> leyyin: no. iSpy is an object in SuperTux.
[2016/03/03 13:25:43] <Tobbi> leyyin: But honestly: I think the world will be worse off with Trump as president than with Hillary Clinton.
[2016/03/03 13:26:53] <Tobbi> tbh, I'd also wish the presidential elections weren't show-off's.
[2016/03/03 13:27:47] <leyyin> politics is acting
[2016/03/03 13:27:48] <mt> yeah
[2016/03/03 13:28:14] <Tobbi> leyyin: True...but more so in the US than in Germany...
[2016/03/03 13:28:42] <Tobbi> Trump resonates with a lot of people who are angry with the current situation.
[2016/03/03 13:28:45] <mt> and I guess (I don't know it since I don't live there) it's also a bit unfair - those candidates who can afford to speak at shows, tour around the US, etc have better chances to be president
[2016/03/03 13:28:56] <Tobbi> mt: Of course.
[2016/03/03 13:29:06] <leyyin> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2de3LhPxpZU
[2016/03/03 13:29:19] <Tobbi> leyyin: You know: In Germany, a lot of people resonate with AfD.
[2016/03/03 13:29:24] <Tobbi> (Alternative for Germany)
[2016/03/03 13:29:33] <mt> (well, I can't really say it's better in Germany - about the money)
[2016/03/03 13:29:38] <Tobbi> Which is a right-wing party...
[2016/03/03 13:29:46] <mt> NPD 2.0
[2016/03/03 13:29:49] <Tobbi> mt: true...
[2016/03/03 13:30:27] <Tobbi> mt: NPD with the difference that they hate foreigners for "a reason".
[2016/03/03 13:30:37] <Tobbi> And that reason, based on fear, resonates with a lot of people.
[2016/03/03 13:30:40] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2016/03/03 13:30:48] <mt> sadly
[2016/03/03 13:31:02] <mt> Haven't we learned enough after two world wars?
[2016/03/03 13:31:27] <Tobbi> mt: I think it's deeply embedded into the German culture. Many people fear that what they've built up will be destroyed...
[2016/03/03 13:31:47] <Tobbi> I mean: Refugees introduce an unstable element into the situation.
[2016/03/03 13:31:57] <Tobbi> A situation that was otherwise built on security and fail-safeness...
[2016/03/03 13:32:13] <Tobbi> And many people are afraid it'll crash the whole construct.
[2016/03/03 13:32:13] <Tobbi> That's how I see it.
[2016/03/03 13:32:21] <mt> yet it's not a reason for xenophobia
[2016/03/03 13:32:37] <Tobbi> mt: These people don't see themselves as xenophobes.
[2016/03/03 13:32:48] <Tobbi> They see refugees as inferior... I think.
[2016/03/03 13:32:50] <mt> Yes, but they *are*
[2016/03/03 13:33:04] <Tobbi> mt: Unfortunately, you cannot talk with these people.
[2016/03/03 13:33:10] <Tobbi> mt: Unless you're maybe their age.
[2016/03/03 13:33:21] <mt> It's the same thing as with Trump, just due to a different cause
[2016/03/03 13:33:39] <Tobbi> Most of them are from the elder generation and they don't want "anyone younger who doesn't know how the world really works" to reason with them.
[2016/03/03 13:33:52] <Tobbi> AfD is the protest part of the elderly.
[2016/03/03 13:34:07] <Tobbi> Oh no, change? We don't want that.
[2016/03/03 13:34:14] <Tobbi> Change is dangerous.
[2016/03/03 13:34:21] <Tobbi> Refugees might potentially mean change.
[2016/03/03 13:34:41] <Tobbi> This is how I see the situation right now.
[2016/03/03 13:34:53] <mt> what I think is silly is that the reason they keep naming is 'cultural values'
[2016/03/03 13:35:11] <mt> Oh, so your christianity isn't about being welcome & nice to people?
[2016/03/03 13:35:19] <Tobbi> mt: hehe, so true.

[2016/03/03 13:35:47] <Tobbi> mt: But they see christianity as a set of rules and guidelines these other people don't have.
[2016/03/03 13:35:49] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/03 13:35:56] <mt> are all the builds finally finished?
[2016/03/03 13:36:02] <Tobbi> They see Islam as a potentially dangerous religion.
[2016/03/03 13:36:13] <Tobbi> mt: On the other hand: Can you blame them for seeing Islam as dangerous?
[2016/03/03 13:36:20] <Tobbi> It was portrayed as being dangerous by the media?
[2016/03/03 13:36:29] <Tobbi> You know: terrorists etc.
[2016/03/03 13:37:00] <mt> Media (well, serious media) didn't picture all muslims as terrorists
[2016/03/03 13:37:11] <mt> If you make that up, that's a problem
[2016/03/03 13:37:13] <Tobbi> mt: I know...but people get the impression, don't they?
[2016/03/03 13:37:27] <Tobbi> There
[2016/03/03 13:37:28] <Tobbi> s a youtube video...
[2016/03/03 13:37:37] <Tobbi> "I'm a muslim but not a terrorist"
[2016/03/03 13:37:43] <Tobbi> So, people seem to think that.
[2016/03/03 13:38:06] <Tobbi> actually, I don't know for sure.
[2016/03/03 13:39:16] <mt> "Erst kürzlich haben wir herausgefunden, dass in Deutschland mehr als 82 Millionen versteckte Terroristen wohnen."

[2016/03/03 14:33:55] <farooghkz> why tux doesnt have a child?
[2016/03/03 14:34:07] <farooghkz> hi tobbi
[2016/03/03 14:34:22] <Tobbi> farooghkz: That's a nice storyline addition :D
[2016/03/03 14:34:48] <Hume2> Because Tux was about to have some, when Nolok stole him Penny.
[2016/03/03 14:34:59] <leyyin> SUPER TUX
[2016/03/03 14:35:04] <leyyin> he does not need children
[2016/03/03 14:35:18] <farooghkz> its a good idea that tux rescues his children
[2016/03/03 14:36:13] <farooghkz> !help
[2016/03/03 14:36:16] <Hume2> Hmmm... maybe, but first he has to regain his penny.
[2016/03/03 14:36:19] <farooghkz> .help
[2016/03/03 14:36:30] <farooghkz> yes
[2016/03/03 14:37:49] <mt> Do we need that 'Everyone should have children'/pro-"family" bullshit?
[2016/03/03 14:38:41] <Hume2> I think we need it more than some other nations.

[2016/03/03 14:39:35] <mt> and we have more important stuff to focus on
[2016/03/03 14:42:50] <farooghkz> what are test collections?
[2016/03/03 14:43:18] <Hume2> It's just a crap for testing various crap.
[2016/03/03 14:43:27] <mt> mostly for testing new features
[2016/03/03 14:43:32] <mt> very short levels
[2016/03/03 14:44:01] <mt> stuff that could actually be useful for unit tests of gameplay features
[2016/03/03 14:44:18] <farooghkz> i installed dev version of supertux
[2016/03/03 14:44:34] <mt> yes, they're included in the development builds
[2016/03/03 14:45:11] <farooghkz> now i should test them and find bugs?
[2016/03/03 14:45:21] <mt> probably not
[2016/03/03 14:45:47] <farooghkz> i'd like to find bugs
[2016/03/03 14:45:58] <farooghkz> during playing
[2016/03/03 14:46:04] <mt> then just play the game as much as you can
[2016/03/03 14:46:15] <mt> test recent changes
[2016/03/03 14:46:16] <Tobbi> Yeah, good idea.
[2016/03/03 14:46:32] <mt> Test levels are too limited to find complex issues
[2016/03/03 14:46:38] <farooghkz> but till now i didnt find anything wrong
[2016/03/03 14:46:40] <Tobbi> Hume2: I suggest to have different versions of SuperTux: One with 2 Tux's, one with 2 Pennys etc.
[2016/03/03 14:47:23] <Hume2> Tobbi: I think that we should let that decision to a meeting.
[2016/03/03 14:47:32] <Tobbi> Hume2: I am kidding.
[2016/03/03 14:47:38] <Hume2> :D
[2016/03/03 14:48:11] <farooghkz> everyone here are developers of dis game?
[2016/03/03 14:48:34] <Tobbi> Not everyone.
[2016/03/03 14:49:12] <Tobbi> farooghkz: The people with +o or +v are developers. Most of them.
[2016/03/03 14:49:21] <Tobbi> Feel free to help us out in any way.
[2016/03/03 14:49:24] <farooghkz> so most people r developer?

[2016/03/03 14:49:36] <farooghkz> ok

[2016/03/03 14:49:49] <Hume2> Well, a big part of the active ones :P
[2016/03/03 14:50:13] <farooghkz> lol
[2016/03/03 14:50:38] <Tobbi> And the good thing is: Only a minority of the active developers doesn't know anything about computers.
[2016/03/03 14:50:57] <farooghkz> i think i can help supertux by playing dev ver.
[2016/03/03 14:51:11] <Hume2> Tobbi: :D

[2016/03/03 14:53:06] <farooghkz> yes
[2016/03/03 14:53:27] <farooghkz> but im not a good programmer
[2016/03/03 14:53:35] <Tobbi> farooghkz: Okay, make sure you're able to compile supertux yourself...
[2016/03/03 14:53:47] <Tobbi> Then you can help us.
[2016/03/03 14:53:56] <Tobbi> And it would be good if you could stay in this channel.
[2016/03/03 14:54:55] <farooghkz> y compiling supertux by myself?
[2016/03/03 14:55:13] <Tobbi> farooghkz: Actually, it's not needed, but if you want to test the latest version, it's preferred-
[2016/03/03 14:55:19] <Tobbi> We do offer nightly builds, though.
[2016/03/03 14:55:22] <Tobbi> see the topic.
[2016/03/03 14:55:58] <farooghkz> nightlies?
[2016/03/03 14:56:27] <Tobbi> farooghkz: http://download.supertuxproject.org/download/
[2016/03/03 14:56:38] <Tobbi> Download the appropriate version for your OS.
[2016/03/03 14:56:46] <farooghkz> what are those?
[2016/03/03 14:57:06] <farooghkz> are they bin builds?
[2016/03/03 14:57:16] <Tobbi> farooghkz: These are recent versions of the game.
[2016/03/03 14:57:19] <Tobbi> Very recent.
[2016/03/03 14:57:46] <Tobbi> Whenever someone changes something about the code, a nightly is being built.
[2016/03/03 14:57:47] <Tobbi> Most of the time.
[2016/03/03 14:57:55] <farooghkz> they are src code or bin build?
[2016/03/03 14:58:27] <Tobbi> binary builds.
[2016/03/03 14:58:57] <farooghkz> well id have tools to compile supertux myself
[2016/03/03 14:59:18] <Tobbi> it's up to you.
[2016/03/03 14:59:30] <farooghkz> ok
[2016/03/03 15:00:16] <farooghkz> i can help by playing recent builds of supertux.right?
[2016/03/03 15:00:40] <Tobbi> yes, certainly.
[2016/03/03 15:00:53] <Tobbi> If you want, you can also create levels yourself.
[2016/03/03 15:00:57] <Tobbi> Not sure if you're into that.

[2016/03/03 15:03:34] <Tobbi> farooghkz: Sure.
[2016/03/03 15:03:37] <Tobbi> :)
[2016/03/03 15:03:41] <Tobbi> Just stay around.
[2016/03/03 15:03:43] <Tobbi> Participate in discussions.
[2016/03/03 15:04:01] <farooghkz> lol ok
[2016/03/03 15:04:34] <farooghkz> supertux is written in which language?c++?
[2016/03/03 15:05:04] <Tobbi> farooghkz: For the most part, yes.
[2016/03/03 15:05:18] <Tobbi> We also use python (for the editor), lisp as a definition file.
[2016/03/03 15:05:19] <Tobbi> squirrel.
[2016/03/03 15:05:23] <farooghkz> and other parts?
[2016/03/03 15:05:39] <farooghkz> editor?
[2016/03/03 15:05:40] <Tobbi> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux
[2016/03/03 15:05:48] <Tobbi> farooghkz: We have several editors.
[2016/03/03 15:05:54] <Tobbi> Using C# on the most popular one.
[2016/03/03 15:06:03] <Tobbi> And Python for the one we want to get most popular.
[2016/03/03 15:06:31] <farooghkz> level editor?
[2016/03/03 15:07:21] <Tobbi> farooghkz: Yeah, external programs for creating levels.
[2016/03/03 15:08:15] <farooghkz> how someone can create levels by those tools?do u have api?
[2016/03/03 15:08:41] <Tobbi> farooghkz: We don't have an API but documentation available.
[2016/03/03 15:08:56] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/03/03 15:09:26] <farooghkz> (sry for asking too much questions)
[2016/03/03 15:10:22] <Tobbi> No, it's fine.
[2016/03/03 15:10:37] <Tobbi> farooghkz: What do you mean by API, anyway?
[2016/03/03 15:10:50] <Tobbi> You can take a look at the syntax of a level...
[2016/03/03 15:11:06] <Tobbi> But it's not actually necessary since the level editor does everything for you.
[2016/03/03 15:12:03] <farooghkz> ok
[2016/03/03 15:12:38] <Hume2> (except the hidden features those just a few people know about :D)
[2016/03/03 15:12:56] <farooghkz> ?!
[2016/03/03 15:13:00] <farooghkz> lol
[2016/03/03 15:13:16] <Tobbi> Hume2: ssh
[2016/03/03 15:13:21] <Tobbi> shh!!!
[2016/03/03 15:13:29] <Hume2> OK
[2016/03/03 15:13:37] <Tobbi> Nobody has the intention of building hidden features into SuperTux.
[2016/03/03 15:13:41] <Hume2> There are no hidden features in SuperTux.
[2016/03/03 15:13:54] <Tobbi> Hume2: Well, some things are not currently built into editors.
[2016/03/03 15:13:55] <Hume2> I was just joking :P
[2016/03/03 15:14:05] <Tobbi> Hume2: horizontal gradients for example.
[2016/03/03 15:14:13] <Hume2> That's true.
[2016/03/03 15:15:15] <Tobbi> Hume2: But anyway, what is a good format for smart tiles, something that is not so lengthy and maybe fits into one line?
[2016/03/03 15:15:50] <Hume2> Well, it's still better than it was before AFAIK.
[2016/03/03 15:16:05] <Tobbi> I know...
[2016/03/03 15:16:14] <Tobbi> but I want to have smart tiles resizable.
[2016/03/03 15:16:37] <Hume2> Oh, you're speaking about the flexlay.
[2016/03/03 15:16:41] <farooghkz> another question.im a noob python,c,cpp programer.can i do anything with that ability?
[2016/03/03 15:17:03] <Tobbi> farooghkz: How much do you know about those languages?
[2016/03/03 15:18:01] <farooghkz> well i know syntax of those

[2016/03/03 15:19:51] <Tobbi> SDL is great. SuperTux is written in SDL.
[2016/03/03 15:20:26] <Hume2> In fact, you don't have to know much about sdl/opengl to program SuperTux.
[2016/03/03 15:20:38] <Tobbi> OpenGL / OpenAL is great. SuperTux is also making use of that.

[2016/03/03 15:20:57] <Hume2> It's because it has its own libraries to operate with opengl.
[2016/03/03 15:21:20] <Tobbi> What is going on with Travis?
[2016/03/03 15:21:49] <Tobbi> Right!
[2016/03/03 15:21:55] <Tobbi> Travis doesn't have SDL_ttf.
[2016/03/03 15:21:59] <Tobbi> I need to fix that.
[2016/03/03 15:22:16] <farooghkz> i just know about main cpp libs
[2016/03/03 15:22:36] <Hume2> That's not bad at all.

[2016/03/03 15:24:20] <Tobbi> eh, great.
[2016/03/03 15:24:37] <farooghkz> lmao
[2016/03/03 15:24:37] <Tobbi> farooghkz: But, you said you know some languages. Just try some things out. smaller things.
[2016/03/03 15:24:55] <farooghkz> like what?
[2016/03/03 15:25:21] <Hume2> You can study just a part of code, without the need of kowing the rest.
[2016/03/03 15:25:30] <Hume2> *knowing
[2016/03/03 15:25:46] <Tobbi> Hume2: Do we have smaller tasks?
[2016/03/03 15:25:50] <Tobbi> Or have I implemented those all?
[2016/03/03 15:26:14] <Hume2> Well, not rwally sure about that.
[2016/03/03 15:26:19] <Hume2> *really
[2016/03/03 15:26:53] <Tobbi> I'll find something.
[2016/03/03 15:26:56] <Hume2> farooghkz: You can start with getting how the badguys work.
[2016/03/03 15:27:11] <Tobbi> farooghkz: If you want to, that is. If you want to do quality assurance, I am totally fine with that.

[2016/03/03 18:00:43] <uptime> It's basically whatever the GC asks — but generally the intention is to show it off, and for it to be known you're a contributor of the said project, so the whole sort of point is to have your name in it :)
[2016/03/03 18:00:46] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Any ideas? i dont want my name in it much...

[2016/03/04 03:21:58] <Necrosporus> it's not that bad
[2016/03/04 03:25:18] <mt> Necrosporus: try using a different renderer (using the --renderer command line option)
[2016/03/04 03:25:34] <mt> Necrosporus: if possible, opengl, as it's hardware accelerated
[2016/03/04 03:33:24] <Necrosporus> Actually changing renderer to sdl helps
[2016/03/04 03:33:34] <Necrosporus> With opengl it's worse

[2016/03/04 11:02:24] <mt> I wonder if we can get our custom tinygettext code merged to upstream
[2016/03/04 11:02:49] <Tobbi> I don't know. Does grumbel even care?
[2016/03/04 11:03:08] <Tobbi> Are our modification even worth it?
[2016/03/04 11:03:42] <Tobbi> mt: ^^
[2016/03/04 11:04:08] <mt> leper` seems to have push access as well
[2016/03/04 11:05:14] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2016/03/04 11:05:15] <Tobbi> So...
[2016/03/04 11:05:20] <mt> can we at least keep one of our branches even with tinygettext master
[2016/03/04 11:05:42] <mt> and then rebase the branch with the custom modifications
[2016/03/04 11:05:57] <Tobbi> mt: I guess upstream is even.
[2016/03/04 11:06:23] <mt> `upstream` in supertux/tinygettext contains our custom modifications that are up-to-date
[2016/03/04 11:06:25] <Tobbi> Actually, no, it isn't.
[2016/03/04 11:06:28] <Tobbi> right
[2016/03/04 11:06:32] <mt> `master` contains some of maths22's changes
[2016/03/04 11:06:51] <Tobbi> Does upstream contain those?
[2016/03/04 11:06:56] <mt> yes
[2016/03/04 11:07:00] <mt> at least some
[2016/03/04 11:07:04] <mt> I haven't checked
[2016/03/04 11:07:06] <Tobbi> Zes.
[2016/03/04 11:07:07] <Tobbi> Yes
[2016/03/04 11:07:42] <Tobbi> mt: So, do I merge upstream with master now, and then reset upstream to tinygettext/master?
[2016/03/04 11:08:20] <mt> I'd keep master even with tinygettext/tinygettext
[2016/03/04 11:08:27] <mt> as that's the usual fork procedure
[2016/03/04 11:08:35] <Tobbi> Okay, i can do that.
[2016/03/04 11:08:39] <mt> then have a branch supertux-modifications
[2016/03/04 11:08:43] <mt> with our modifications
[2016/03/04 11:09:13] <mt> however, I think that our changes seem to actually be worth merging in tinygettext/tinygettext
[2016/03/04 11:09:14] <Tobbi> mt: So I guess I'll rename the upstream branch to supertux-modifications.
[2016/03/04 11:09:25] <mt> Tobbi: yeah
[2016/03/04 11:09:31] <Tobbi> one moment.

[2016/03/04 11:20:38] <Ispy> [10supertux] 07tobbi 1475b06ed Update tinygettext to latest supertux-changes branch HEAD
[2016/03/04 11:20:51] <leper`> mt: yes, am maintaining tinygettext
[2016/03/04 11:21:39] <Tobbi> leper`: There are some changes in our fork that might be worth considering.
[2016/03/04 11:21:51] <leper`> anything specific?
[2016/03/04 11:22:19] * Tobbi checks.
[2016/03/04 11:22:41] <Tobbi> mt: Which one of those changes would you want to get merged_
[2016/03/04 11:22:42] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/03/04 11:23:10] <leper`> those N commits "Fix build", "Fix build (again)" seem strange since it builds everywhere as far as I can tell :P
[2016/03/04 11:23:25] <Tobbi> leper`: Yeah, I know...I was testing around, I guess.
[2016/03/04 11:23:46] <mt> Best would be all
[2016/03/04 11:23:57] <leper`> "Reduce log spam (uncomment collision warnings)" -> just don't specify a logging function for that
[2016/03/04 11:24:01] <mt> I think our changes are quite useful for everyone
[2016/03/04 11:24:11] <leper`> (maybe a point could be made that the logging level should be another one, but well)
[2016/03/04 11:24:14] <Tobbi> mt: I don't think so, the branch contains a lot of testing around.
[2016/03/04 11:24:28] <Tobbi> I'll check something.
[2016/03/04 11:24:34] <mt> Tobbi: would it, if the fix commits are squashed?
[2016/03/04 11:24:47] <Tobbi> I'll have to check.
[2016/03/04 11:25:23] <Tobbi> mt: Problem is that this changes the API: https://github.com/tinygettext/tinygettext/commit/78898853f28a406adcc4e009a562c29da8011bb5
[2016/03/04 11:25:34] <Tobbi> aka, function signature to accomodate supertux.
[2016/03/04 11:25:34] <leper`> for the dirent.h change -> there is a nicer solution in the open pull request, but that is in a commit that changes a few things that aren't useful
[2016/03/04 11:25:59] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/03/04 11:26:08] <Tobbi> Yeah, that was just to make appveyor happy.
[2016/03/04 11:28:52] <leper`> (I'm happy to merge clean and useful (for some project using tinygettext) changes, but that requires someone to actually submit them)
[2016/03/04 11:29:09] <Tobbi> leper`: I will probably separate the fixes into branches...
[2016/03/04 11:29:15] <Tobbi> And then we can merge them separately.
[2016/03/04 11:29:21] <leper`> sure :-)
[2016/03/04 11:29:21] <Tobbi> mt: Happy with that?

[2016/03/04 11:53:31] <Tobbi> mt: So after leper` has merged my modifications, I will rebase it with latest upstream, remove the other commit that did that and force-push supertux-changes, right?
[2016/03/04 11:54:17] <mt> force pushing changes commit IDs and a such you should then also update the submodule
[2016/03/04 11:54:37] <mt> I'd wait for all the changes to be accepted/rejected to force-push
[2016/03/04 11:54:41] <Tobbi> mt: I can do that...just making sure this is the right way to do it.
[2016/03/04 11:54:46] <Tobbi> okay, fine.
[2016/03/04 11:54:47] <mt> Also, rebase on latest upstream master

[2016/03/04 12:04:49] <leper`> ah well, DictionaryManager::get_dictionary depends on the order
[2016/03/04 12:06:52] <leper`> Tobbi: also fix that { placement
[2016/03/04 12:07:04] <Tobbi> okay.
[2016/03/04 12:07:25] <leyyin> why are you using indent of 4 spaces?
[2016/03/04 12:07:49] <leyyin> why are there 2 indent types in that file? :D
[2016/03/04 12:08:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: Stop it.

[2016/03/04 12:08:52] <leyyin> why is it in tinygettext/tinygettext then?
[2016/03/04 12:08:54] <leper`> I could probably drop that function since only you guys are using it and you are using your own fork
[2016/03/04 12:08:57] <leyyin> someone approved it
[2016/03/04 12:09:21] <leper`> because at some point someone thought you might want to use a non-forked version of some dependency

[2016/03/04 12:12:08] <leper`> I should probably continue with that now since there's a newer version of that now
[2016/03/04 12:12:16] <leper`> mine most likely
[2016/03/04 12:12:44] * mt doesn't understand why people use 2 spaces, or tabs
[2016/03/04 12:12:54] <leyyin> me neither
[2016/03/04 12:13:00] <mt> 4 spaces, no tabs is readable and consistent
[2016/03/04 12:13:04] <leyyin> but I usually respect the repo convention
[2016/03/04 12:13:10] <leper`> because one char instead of 2 or 4 is wasteful and bogus
[2016/03/04 12:13:25] <leper`> and forcing everyone to use the same width when you can do things dynamically is stupid
[2016/03/04 12:13:26] <Tobbi> leper`: So, do I change the indentation to 2 spaces or what?
[2016/03/04 12:13:31] <leper`> yeah
[2016/03/04 12:13:35] <Tobbi> okay.
[2016/03/04 12:13:45] <mt> leyyin: I usually also respect that

[2016/03/04 12:14:04] <leyyin> or a openssh contributor :P
[2016/03/04 12:14:11] <mt> also, I don't just convert a fork using a format tool
[2016/03/04 12:14:15] <mt> I did that once
[2016/03/04 12:14:17] <leper`> leyyin: openssl?
[2016/03/04 12:14:43] <mt> but then upstream did push some commits and it was a pain to manually fix the conflicts
[2016/03/04 12:15:06] <leper`> mt: yes, but since "upstream" isn't consistent in this case and I sort of am "upstream" changing it once would be nice
[2016/03/04 12:15:09] <leyyin> yes, openssl

[2016/03/04 12:17:16] <mt> but otherwise, I really like openbsd's code style guide
[2016/03/04 12:17:29] <Tobbi> mt: I guess after merging I can just git rebase and specify d for delete on the commit that does the same thing, right?
[2016/03/04 12:17:46] <Tobbi> in git rebase --interactive
[2016/03/04 12:17:51] <mt> to do what?
[2016/03/04 12:18:06] <leper`> just rebase without anything, then on the conflict (if there is one actually) git rebase --skip
[2016/03/04 12:18:13] <Tobbi> leper`: Might make sense yes.
[2016/03/04 12:18:29] <leper`> or just delete the line in the interactive rebase
[2016/03/04 12:18:33] <Tobbi> I can do that.
[2016/03/04 12:18:48] <leper`> (but for something like this you don't really need the interactive rebase
[2016/03/04 12:18:49] <Tobbi> iirc, specifying d on that commit is the same as deleting the line.
[2016/03/04 12:18:49] <leper`> )
[2016/03/04 12:19:41] <Tobbi> anyway, doesn't matter.
[2016/03/04 12:22:56] <Tobbi> travis is slow today...
[2016/03/04 12:25:02] <leper`> care to add yourself to LICENSE.md?
[2016/03/04 12:25:11] <leper`> (and update the year while you're there?)
[2016/03/04 12:25:44] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2016/03/04 12:25:46] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2016/03/04 12:27:35] <Ispy> [10tinygettext] 07tobbi pushed 1 commit to 09remove_path_from_searchpath 13https://git.io/v2dxq

[2016/03/04 12:30:19] <leper`> Tobbi: thanks
[2016/03/04 12:30:30] <Tobbi> Alright, now, let's rebase our supertux-changes branch.
[2016/03/04 12:33:49] <mt> wait
[2016/03/04 12:34:14] <Tobbi> yes
[2016/03/04 12:34:15] <Tobbi> okay?
[2016/03/04 12:34:24] <mt> I suggest you to do that when everything we want to have upstreamed is merged to upstream
[2016/03/04 12:34:32] <Tobbi> Can do.
[2016/03/04 12:34:42] <mt> because otherwise we'll pollute supertux/supertux repo with submodule update commits
[2016/03/04 12:34:54] <mt> submodule depends on a commit hash, not on a branch
[2016/03/04 12:35:23] <Ispy> [10tinygettext] 07tobbi 04deleted branch 09remove_path_from_searchpath
[2016/03/04 12:35:38] <Tobbi> I know.
[2016/03/04 12:36:51] <leyyin> why I am not surprised http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/04/microsoft-monopolise-pc-games-development-epic-games-gears-of-war
[2016/03/04 12:37:24] <Tobbi> mt: I guess next we can safely add the "sort source files to get reproducible linking order" commit.
[2016/03/04 12:38:24] <mt> yeah
[2016/03/04 12:38:47] <mt> the cmake-related changes look okay for upstream as well
[2016/03/04 12:39:06] <Tobbi> So I can probably cherry-pick those first.
[2016/03/04 12:39:15] @ Quit: datahead7777: Quit: Leaving
[2016/03/04 12:40:03] <mt> now what do you want to cherry-pick where to
[2016/03/04 12:40:10] <mt> to a separate branch?
[2016/03/04 12:47:21] <Tobbi> mt: Yes.
[2016/03/04 12:50:08] <Ispy> [10tinygettext] 07tobbi created branch 09cmake_changes
[2016/03/04 12:50:11] <Tobbi> Just those first.

[2016/03/04 12:53:29] <Tobbi> Okay, done.
[2016/03/04 12:53:31] <Ispy> [10tinygettext] 07reinerh 14dbc914f Sort source files to get reproducible linking order
[2016/03/04 12:55:22] <Tobbi> leper`: Not sure if you're willing to look through those :D
[2016/03/04 12:59:29] <leper`> quite some of those don't seem really useful
[2016/03/04 12:59:54] <leper`> and nearly all of them have some indentation issues which makes looking at the changes harder than it has to be
[2016/03/04 13:00:09] <Tobbi> leper`: Okay, I will have to rebase them, then.
[2016/03/04 13:00:14] <leper`> and for those that could be useful the commit messages do not seem to have much to do with what the commit does
[2016/03/04 13:00:29] <Tobbi> leper`: alright, which of those do you want?
[2016/03/04 13:00:32] <leper`> also splitting things based on what they do would be nice
[2016/03/04 13:01:02] <Tobbi> Probably. Okay, one moment.
[2016/03/04 13:02:19] <Tobbi> leper`: the first commit is actually the one everything afterwards depends on.
[2016/03/04 13:02:24] <Tobbi> So can I do this alone?
[2016/03/04 13:04:07] <leper`> that one is the one with the big issue :P
[2016/03/04 13:04:16] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/03/04 13:05:17] <leper`> (not that I care a lot about the cmake build files but that commit is just a mess)
[2016/03/04 13:06:22] <Tobbi> I will deal with it later.
[2016/03/04 13:06:22] <Ispy> [10tinygettext] 07tobbi pushed 2 commits to 09master 13https://git.io/v2FJS

[2016/03/04 13:06:33] <Tobbi> just keeping master up-to-date
[2016/03/04 13:08:36] <Tobbi> leper`: So, what do you want me to change about that commit?
[2016/03/04 13:08:47] <Tobbi> I don't actually know anything. I don't quite understand cmake.
[2016/03/04 13:09:23] <leper`> indentation for one, likely more but that thing is just unreadable
[2016/03/04 13:09:38] <leper`> possibly easier to just define having iconv in that one case
[2016/03/04 13:11:02] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: https://github.com/tinygettext/tinygettext/commit/0a686cbddfad24a55516d50f0f8a8f8bd08d020e was your commit. Can you make it ready for inclusion in upstream?
[2016/03/04 13:11:06] <Tobbi> See issues above.
[2016/03/04 13:11:35] <Tobbi> once ready, push it to a new feature branch, aka iconv_fixes in the supertux repo.
[2016/03/04 13:11:47] <Tobbi> leper`: See, delegated that task to someone else -> fixed on my side.
[2016/03/04 13:11:57] <leper`> it's also not really clear what that commit tries to do
[2016/03/04 13:12:06] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: After fixing, please do a pull request against upstream.
[2016/03/04 13:12:22] <leper`> I guess it has something to do with you wanting to use SDL's iconv, but dunno
[2016/03/04 13:12:37] <Tobbi> leper`: I guess we had issues with double iconv or something.
[2016/03/04 13:12:41] @ Quit: Anupkumar: Quit: Connection closed for inactivity
[2016/03/04 13:13:14] <Tobbi> No probably not.

[2016/03/04 13:14:15] <Tobbi> See you later, everyone.
[2016/03/04 13:14:21] <leper`> "sports"
[2016/03/04 13:14:31] <Tobbi> leper`: Real sports.
[2016/03/04 13:14:45] <leper`> Drinking on Friday night isn't a real sport
[2016/03/04 13:14:55] <Tobbi> leper`: *sigh*, Karate.

[2016/03/04 13:16:25] <leper`> that, I'm not sure what that commit tries to accomplish, or why it does that
[2016/03/04 13:17:16] <leper`> and possibly more, but given that reading it is hard due to it not being formatted properly doesn't help
[2016/03/04 13:17:20] <Mathnerd314> well, there's an iconv error, and it fixes it
[2016/03/04 13:17:29] <leper`> sounds vague
[2016/03/04 13:18:08] <Mathnerd314> yeah. but it stayed in, so it must have worked
[2016/03/04 13:19:10] <leper`> so did "Fix build" and "Fix build (again)"

[2016/03/04 13:19:55] <leper`> (and merging something that fixes some undisclosed error without being able to specify which one or how to verify that the fix works and is correct is not something I'm going to do)
[2016/03/04 13:20:52] @ ced117 joined channel #supertux
[2016/03/04 13:21:01] <Mathnerd314> well, before tinygettext was split out from SuperTux, it used SDL_iconv. but that broke. so I fixed it
[2016/03/04 13:21:30] <Mathnerd314> so now SuperTux sets HAVE_SDL and it uses SDL_iconv again
[2016/03/04 13:21:32] <mt> in *what way* did it break
[2016/03/04 13:22:12] <Mathnerd314> cmake didn't compile it with -DHAVE_SDL anymore, because it was a separate project
[2016/03/04 13:23:07] <Mathnerd314> CMake is poorly documented, there's not much point in describing it further
[2016/03/04 13:24:37] <mt> leper`: ^
[2016/03/04 13:31:27] <leper`> and why don't you just pass in an include dir for iconv, and if that is empty do the iconv required part that already is in there
[2016/03/04 13:31:34] @ Quit: tuxdev_: Ping timeout: 260 seconds
[2016/03/04 13:31:53] <leper`> would be a one line addition instead of rewriting half the file
[2016/03/04 13:34:22] <Mathnerd314> because that would be more work... this way other projects that use SDL will also use SDL_iconv

[2016/03/05 08:28:36] @ ToBeCloud joined channel #supertux
[2016/03/05 08:29:41] <Tobbi> Done.
[2016/03/05 08:29:44] <Tobbi> Hello ToBeCloud
[2016/03/05 08:30:24] <ToBeCloud> Hey :)
[2016/03/05 08:32:58] <ToBeCloud> I love this game. When I was... 14? I started trying to learn Wansti's melodies on the piano by ear, later I found his website and showed him my work. At the beginning of this year, I've released an album that contains a remixed piano song by Wansti and me :D
[2016/03/05 08:34:05] <ToBeCloud> Together with friends, we created a "SuperTux speedruns" page and competed in finishing the vanilla levels as quickly as possible. Sometimes with "perfect" times, as horizontal movement never stopped
[2016/03/05 08:34:48] <Tobbi> Great :D
[2016/03/05 08:35:19] <ToBeCloud> What I like most is the forest world. Maybe for the music, maybe because of the atmosphere
[2016/03/05 08:35:57] <ToBeCloud> And the unique search for keys is a wonderful gimmick. I have to admit that when I was younger and failed ten-thirty times at hard levels, I manipulated the savegame to be able to continue with the rest
[2016/03/05 08:36:31] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 08:36:37] <Tobbi> Now it's built in :D
[2016/03/05 08:36:42] <Tobbi> a cheat console, I mean.
[2016/03/05 08:36:49] <ToBeCloud> Oh? :D
[2016/03/05 08:37:16] <ToBeCloud> Ah, there was something. I think I failed at using it when it was introduced :D
[2016/03/05 08:37:20] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 08:37:35] <ToBeCloud> Must be years ago already though
[2016/03/05 08:37:38] <Tobbi> ToBeCloud: Start SuperTux with --developer, then press F2 or so?
[2016/03/05 08:37:48] <ToBeCloud> Ah :D Will try
[2016/03/05 08:37:49] <Tobbi> Oh, no, then it's not the one I am talking about.
[2016/03/05 08:37:54] <Tobbi> ToBeCloud: Install 0.4.0
[2016/03/05 08:38:03] <Tobbi> That's the latest stable release.
[2016/03/05 08:38:10] <ToBeCloud> Did yesterday :) It's really cool
[2016/03/05 08:38:11] <mt> cheat menu is there since the Halloween addon has been released
[2016/03/05 08:38:23] <mt> (well, about that time)
[2016/03/05 08:38:33] <mt> that was in October 2014
[2016/03/05 08:38:48] <ToBeCloud> Well no, then the cheat console you mean is newer than what I thought I had failed at using
[2016/03/05 08:39:04] <Tobbi> There's a regular console as well.
[2016/03/05 08:39:12] <mt> the debug console exists since years tho
[2016/03/05 08:40:36] <Tobbi> yes

[2016/03/05 09:25:43] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: If you want to help develop supertux, feel free to grab the source code.
[2016/03/05 09:25:49] <ToBeFree> mt, I sadly have no experience with creating looping songs
[2016/03/05 09:26:23] <ToBeFree> oh, I just learned the basics of C :D I believe coding is not what I could improve SuperTux with
[2016/03/05 09:26:43] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: Actually, composers are needed as well.
[2016/03/05 09:26:45] <mt> ToBeFree: yes I know very off-topic here, but has https://github.com/zohlai/zohlai/pull/4 been upstreamed to atheme? If not, could you prepare a pull request for the atheme/atheme repo with a more descriptive commit message (e.g. issue detailed in the commit message)? (atheme development is resuming now)
[2016/03/05 09:27:04] <ToBeFree> wait what
[2016/03/05 09:27:07] <Tobbi> mt: We are *always* off-topic here...
[2016/03/05 09:27:10] <ToBeFree> Atheme development is resuming? :D
[2016/03/05 09:27:20] <mt> ToBeFree: yeah
[2016/03/05 09:27:21] <ToBeFree> *cough* unexpected *cough*

[2016/03/05 09:27:53] <mt> I did?
[2016/03/05 09:27:56] <ToBeFree> Oh, mt, I have a nice description for that:
[2016/03/05 09:28:18] <Tobbi> mt: You did.
[2016/03/05 09:28:19] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/03/05 09:31:05] <Tobbi> mt: Couldn't we use that forest theme remix for the forest credits page, if there is one?
[2016/03/05 09:31:39] <mt> Interesting idea
[2016/03/05 09:31:49] <Tobbi> I like the tune and it would fit perfect.

[2016/03/05 09:33:44] <ToBeFree> it's licensed CreativeCommons: by-sa 4.0 or any previous version if you like. Credit could go to Wansti (of course :D) and Tobias "ToBeFree" Frei

[2016/03/05 09:35:00] <ToBeFree> Moll.
[2016/03/05 09:35:01] <ToBeFree> :P
[2016/03/05 09:35:01] <Tobbi> Oh, and a switch from D-Dur to E-Dur.
[2016/03/05 09:35:03] <Tobbi> Moll?
[2016/03/05 09:35:06] <ToBeFree> All in Moll
[2016/03/05 09:35:20] <Tobbi> Damn, I don't know anything about composing.
[2016/03/05 09:35:23] <ToBeFree> :D
[2016/03/05 09:35:26] <farooghkz> tobbi, i couldnt
[2016/03/05 09:35:27] <mt> (it's not dur/moll in english)
[2016/03/05 09:35:34] <ToBeFree> major/minor, yeah
[2016/03/05 09:35:37] <ToBeFree> this is all minor :)
[2016/03/05 09:35:38] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/03/05 09:35:47] <Tobbi> farooghkz: This was Linux, right?
[2016/03/05 09:35:47] <leper`> So hurr durr is German?
[2016/03/05 09:36:01] <ToBeFree> (minor is clearly superior, making the name weird :P)
[2016/03/05 09:36:07] <farooghkz> tobbi, yes ubuntu
[2016/03/05 09:36:59] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: I always thought Kreuze = Dur and bs = Moll, no?
[2016/03/05 09:37:02] <Tobbi> farooghkz: One moment.
[2016/03/05 09:37:13] <ToBeFree> oh, Tobbi, both is both :)
[2016/03/05 09:37:34] <ToBeFree> Any number of Kreuze or bs can always be either Moll or Dur
[2016/03/05 09:37:39] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: Oh, wait, is the distance between the note important?
[2016/03/05 09:37:43] <Tobbi> Dur-Dreiklang, Moll-Dreiklang
[2016/03/05 09:37:47] <ToBeFree> hmm
[2016/03/05 09:38:02] <Tobbi> Damn this.
[2016/03/05 09:38:06] <ToBeFree> well yes, the distance is important :D
[2016/03/05 09:38:08] <Tobbi> I should've paid attention in school.
[2016/03/05 09:38:18] <farooghkz> tobbi, there isnt anything wrong with ur servers,softwares,etc.
[2016/03/05 09:38:28] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: So, it was Kleine Terz, Große Terz = Dur, the other way round, moll.
[2016/03/05 09:38:34] <Tobbi> something like that.
[2016/03/05 09:38:44] <Tobbi> farooghkz: What issue did you have installing?
[2016/03/05 09:38:52] <farooghkz> tobbi, i didnt have time yesterday to do that
[2016/03/05 09:38:58] <Tobbi> farooghkz: Ah, no problem.
[2016/03/05 09:39:13] <ToBeFree> https://archive.org/download/tobefree-freemusic-1/20-forest-education-remastered.ogg  <--- Wansti used a professional piano font to remix the song. It probably sounds better on better speakers and worse on bad speakers [I own only cheap speakers and phone speakers]
[2016/03/05 09:39:27] <Tobbi> I give up learning how to compose.
[2016/03/05 09:39:41] <ToBeFree> Tobbi, I honestly don't know :)
[2016/03/05 09:39:47] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 09:39:51] <ToBeFree> I'm just playing xD
[2016/03/05 09:40:05] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: So, you're playing and recording it using a MIDI-Keyboard?
[2016/03/05 09:40:07] <ToBeFree> (well, there is sheet music http://www.freiwuppertal.de/freemusic-1/18-forestprophecyreeducated-tobefree-sheet.pdf )
[2016/03/05 09:40:09] <farooghkz> tobbi, i also have school
[2016/03/05 09:40:25] <Tobbi> farooghkz: Okay, in that case, we can talk later, if you want.
[2016/03/05 09:40:27] <ToBeFree> nah, I did that before, but I'm using MuseScore now, create sheet music and let it automatically be converted to a sound file
[2016/03/05 09:40:28] <mt> I wonder about the licensing when a professional soundfont is used
[2016/03/05 09:41:03] * mt also suggests http://lilypond.org/
[2016/03/05 09:41:15] <ToBeFree> I used the public domain Fluid R3 GM soundfont, Wansti... hmmm... I'm quite sure that bought soundfonts may be used in commercially used music without stating which soundfont was used...
[2016/03/05 09:41:16] <Tobbi> MuseScore is superior afaik.
[2016/03/05 09:41:21] @ Quit: farooghkz: Quit: used jmIrc
[2016/03/05 09:41:33] <ToBeFree> oh, lilypond, like LaTeX vs OpenOffice
[2016/03/05 09:41:50] <Tobbi> I don't use MuseScore that often.
[2016/03/05 09:42:11] <Tobbi> Oh, Lilypond is different from MuseScor.
[2016/03/05 09:42:12] <Tobbi> e
[2016/03/05 09:42:28] <mt> only that Lilypond is kept more up-to-date, while LaTeX is still stuck in the last century
[2016/03/05 09:42:58] <Tobbi> but I like that remix.
[2016/03/05 09:43:00] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 09:43:09] <Tobbi> I am listening to it on repeat :D
[2016/03/05 09:43:17] <mt> LaTeX is like, yeah it's really awful and no one wants to use it, but still everyone does because there's nothing better
[2016/03/05 09:43:29] <leper`> Tobbi: I'm kinda glad I'm not alone :D
[2016/03/05 09:43:35] <Tobbi> leper`: :D
[2016/03/05 09:43:40] <Tobbi> leper`: Seriously_
[2016/03/05 09:43:40] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/03/05 09:43:57] <leper`> yep, though I also listened to some other things on that website

[2016/03/05 09:45:19] <Tobbi> But I guess I understand even less than he did about CMake.

[2016/03/05 09:46:56] <Tobbi> And then, rebase...*sigh*
[2016/03/05 09:47:02] <leper`> heh
[2016/03/05 09:47:20] <leper`> try rebasing things with newer library versions sometime
[2016/03/05 09:47:30] <leper`> (where that library alone is huge)
[2016/03/05 09:47:53] <Tobbi> leper`: No, thanks.
[2016/03/05 09:48:08] <Tobbi> leper`: actually, we did for Squirrel. But it broke. And I couldn't fix it.
[2016/03/05 09:48:14] <leper`> I did suspect you didn't want to do anything with moz code again :P
[2016/03/05 09:48:42] <Tobbi> leper`: I never did anything on the Mozilla code in the first place.
[2016/03/05 09:48:44] <Tobbi> It's a mess.
[2016/03/05 09:48:55] <leper`> (I probably should look into finishing that thing sometime but meh)
[2016/03/05 09:50:51] <Tobbi> leper`: What do you want to finish?
[2016/03/05 09:51:08] <leper`> updating the bundled spidermonkey for 0ad
[2016/03/05 09:51:32] <leper`> (from 31 to 38; actually finished for normal usage, but it breaks debug builds and some small other issues)
[2016/03/05 09:51:57] <Tobbi> leper`: ugly! Ask Archaopteryx for help :D
[2016/03/05 09:52:03] <Tobbi> No, probably not.
[2016/03/05 09:52:40] <Tobbi> I should learn how to use lilypond
[2016/03/05 09:53:04] <mt> spidermonkey? isn't that a javascript thing?
[2016/03/05 09:53:12] <mt> why would you use it in a game?
[2016/03/05 09:53:16] <Tobbi> mt: It's called JavaScript engine
[2016/03/05 09:53:25] <Tobbi> And for scripting support, probably?
[2016/03/05 09:53:34] <leper`> well, I should write a small testcase for the breakage (which is deep in spidermonkey) and tell upstream to fix it and use the release version for debug builds
[2016/03/05 09:53:45] <leper`> mt: JS engine for the scripting part
[2016/03/05 09:54:07] <Tobbi> leper`: Also, I tried 0 A.D. yesterday but was defeated by the AI in no time...
[2016/03/05 09:54:17] <leper`> it does that to new players :D
[2016/03/05 09:54:20] <mt> the cool people now use microsoft's open sourced JS engine from MS Edge </notreally>
[2016/03/05 09:54:21] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 09:54:40] <Tobbi> mt: You forgot to open that <notreally> tag :P
[2016/03/05 09:54:46] <Tobbi> Unless you meant <notreally />
[2016/03/05 09:54:54] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/03/05 09:54:58] <Tobbi> XML is weird.
[2016/03/05 09:55:17] <leper`> (old players just know the few tricks to make the AI do stupid things
[2016/03/05 09:55:18] <leper`> )
[2016/03/05 09:55:26] <mt> no, I forgot to put it in class NotReally extends String { ... }
[2016/03/05 09:55:31] <leper`> Tobbi: Yes, mt totally forgot that </sarcasm>
[2016/03/05 09:55:36] <Tobbi> grr
[2016/03/05 09:56:02] <Tobbi> mt: NotReally implements SarcasticComment
[2016/03/05 09:56:25] <Tobbi> mt: If you know so much about development, why don't you help coding supertux, actually?
[2016/03/05 09:56:28] <leper`> mt: actually Chakra Core seems to have relatively nice (didn't look very long) APIs, but that thing isn't portable yet
[2016/03/05 09:56:30] <Tobbi> You could be a great help.
[2016/03/05 09:56:52] <mt> Tobbi: because I don't know anything about graphics code
[2016/03/05 09:57:01] <mt> and SDL and physfs
[2016/03/05 09:57:01] <Tobbi> haha :D
[2016/03/05 09:57:06] <Tobbi> mt: Neither do I
[2016/03/05 09:57:15] <leper`> (but since I don't expect that API to be stable (why would they do that, all the other engines don't do that either)...)
[2016/03/05 09:57:43] <leper`> physfs is just union mounting
[2016/03/05 10:00:14] <mt> Tobbi: also, I don't really understand low-level languages
[2016/03/05 10:00:22] <mt> memory things :/
[2016/03/05 10:00:32] <Tobbi> mt: You don't need to.
[2016/03/05 10:00:40] <Tobbi> SuperTux is not low-level.
[2016/03/05 10:00:51] <leyyin> needs more assembly?
[2016/03/05 10:00:55] <mt> C++ is very much low-level
[2016/03/05 10:01:15] <mt> and low-level languages don't like it when you're doing bad stuff with memory
[2016/03/05 10:01:21] <mt> and then they crash
[2016/03/05 10:02:07] <leper`> just don't allocate things, then you're good
[2016/03/05 10:02:07] <Tobbi> mt: And then you figure out how to fix it...
[2016/03/05 10:02:11] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 10:02:19] <Tobbi> And then you know something about low-level languages.
[2016/03/05 10:02:23] <Tobbi> Perfect opportunity.
[2016/03/05 10:02:39] <mt> "Fix it" is most likely trying until it works
[2016/03/05 10:02:50] <mt> and then I don't know anything more
[2016/03/05 10:02:59] <leyyin> or use rust :P
[2016/03/05 10:03:08] <leyyin> programming low level with memory and safe
[2016/03/05 10:03:19] <Tobbi> ugly!
[2016/03/05 10:03:27] <leyyin> safe!
[2016/03/05 10:03:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: Also, stop it! I don't want to have to do anything with Mozilla.
[2016/03/05 10:04:05] <leyyin> my keyboard just electrocuted me
[2016/03/05 10:04:11] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I do. :D I'd rather deal with them than google.
[2016/03/05 10:04:17] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Exciting.
[2016/03/05 10:04:24] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: You don't know anything about Mozilla.
[2016/03/05 10:04:29] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: You can buy me a new one when you get a new one.
[2016/03/05 10:04:33] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Or google...
[2016/03/05 10:04:40] <Tobbi> true.
[2016/03/05 10:05:00] <mt> actually I once started reading https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/the-stack-and-the-heap.html and it seemed like a quite good introduction on low-level memory things
[2016/03/05 10:06:20] <Tobbi> mt: Don't do that! You'll end up like me: "I don't know anything about computers"
[2016/03/05 10:06:55] <mt> Why?
[2016/03/05 10:07:20] <Tobbi> mt: You know: I have OCD and const-correct everything!
[2016/03/05 10:07:25] <Tobbi> This is not good.
[2016/03/05 10:07:31] <leyyin> Tobbi, that is good for google
[2016/03/05 10:07:34] <Tobbi> I wish I never knew about const-correctness.
[2016/03/05 10:07:39] <leyyin> everyone is OCD and const correctness there
[2016/03/05 10:07:44] <Tobbi> leyyin: Really? :D
[2016/03/05 10:07:53] <leyyin> true code nazis
[2016/03/05 10:07:58] <mt> how does that imply that you don't know anything about computers?
[2016/03/05 10:08:22] <Tobbi> mt: I get overwhelmed and I end up seeing colours instead of code.
[2016/03/05 10:08:39] <Tobbi> Woow, this if statement is really green!
[2016/03/05 10:08:52] <leyyin> oh boy
[2016/03/05 10:08:57] <Tobbi> leyyin: When I am OCD, I am not exactly happy.
[2016/03/05 10:09:12] <Tobbi> So, it's better that I am not working for them.
[2016/03/05 10:10:44] <Tobbi> leyyin: What else is there I can optimize?

[2016/03/05 10:12:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: magic.

[2016/03/05 10:30:42] <ToBeFree> I can also add other non-looping music, but there's probably no real use for it. I'm happy there's use for at least one non-looping music as a second title theme seems to be needed
[2016/03/05 10:31:28] <ToBeFree> http://www.freiwuppertal.de/freemusic-1/03-ilikeyou-tobefree-sheet.ogg This one might be useful for a short story introduction
[2016/03/05 10:32:05] <ToBeFree> http://www.freiwuppertal.de/freemusic-1/10-dreamingoffriendship-tobefree-sheet.ogg if this would loop, it might fit for some levels
[2016/03/05 10:34:15] <ToBeFree> http://www.freiwuppertal.de/freemusic-1/14-fadingdreams-tobefree-sheet.ogg this one too
[2016/03/05 10:34:30] <ToBeFree> I can try looping them, but I'm afraid they're too short to produce a loop that does not become annoying
[2016/03/05 10:35:25] <ToBeFree> although when playing SuperTux, music that might otherwise become annoying after some time will be okay, it seems
[2016/03/05 10:36:29] <Tobbi> We need more variety in level design.
[2016/03/05 10:36:52] <ToBeFree> http://www.freiwuppertal.de/freemusic-1/16-roadtosuccess-tobefree-sheet.ogg  The name "Road To Success" might be interesting for a new level that uses this music. I don't know. I've listened to my own songs so many times that I'm now unable to judge what is nice and what is annoying. After a while, they all become annoying a bit xD
[2016/03/05 10:37:12] <ToBeFree> Tobbi, about level design, the forest world seems to be a wonderful example how to add variety
[2016/03/05 10:37:22] <Tobbi> That's true...
[2016/03/05 10:44:31] <ToBeFree> mt, I currently wonder about licensing
[2016/03/05 10:44:55] <mt> of...? what I mentioned before?
[2016/03/05 10:46:06] <ToBeFree> About the music - for my own music, it's not a problem at all, I'll just give that to the SuperTux project under any license you like. For the Wansti remix you liked, it's probably not a problem as Wansti created music for SuperTux and I'm remixing that music. My remix also contains songs by Wansti that have not been written for SuperTux, though
[2016/03/05 10:46:42] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: Wansti's Music is licensed under CC as well, isn't it?
[2016/03/05 10:46:47] <ToBeFree> correct
[2016/03/05 10:46:55] <ToBeFree> by-sa
[2016/03/05 10:47:19] <Tobbi> So? We just add that to credits and be fine with it...
[2016/03/05 10:47:57] <ToBeFree> ok :) I was afraid it needs to be GPLv3
[2016/03/05 10:48:14] <mt> why that?
[2016/03/05 10:48:14] <ToBeFree> although I've just checked and CC:by-sa works can be licensed as GPLv3 (compatible)
[2016/03/05 10:48:27] <ToBeFree> hmm, because it's a part of a GPLv3 program, I thought. :D
[2016/03/05 10:48:31] <Tobbi> GPL is a horrible license for artistic works.
[2016/03/05 10:48:56] <mt> I'm actually thinking about relicensing SuperTux
[2016/03/05 10:49:07] <ToBeFree> oh, as?
[2016/03/05 10:49:10] <mt> *GPL is brain cancer
[2016/03/05 10:49:32] <mt> I prefer MIT/ISC/BSD/NCSA/zlib-style licenses
[2016/03/05 10:49:37] <Tobbi> mt: you cannot relicense SuperTux without our all permission.
[2016/03/05 10:49:43] <mt> right
[2016/03/05 10:50:09] <mt> but we can require new files/classes to be licensed under the new license
[2016/03/05 10:50:31] <mt> and we can ask old contributors for permission

[2016/03/05 11:18:36] <ToBeFree> squashed? Oh, that's a thing
[2016/03/05 11:18:47] <ToBeFree> Sorry, I know nearly nothing about git :D
[2016/03/05 11:19:14] <mt> git <3
[2016/03/05 11:19:18] <mt> when you know how it works
[2016/03/05 11:19:38] <ToBeFree> I do like git! :D However, https://xkcd.com/1597/
[2016/03/05 11:21:22] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: You did it wrong! It's "I don't know anything about git"
[2016/03/05 11:21:38] <ToBeFree> :(
[2016/03/05 11:21:54] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: I don't know anything about computers.
[2016/03/05 11:21:57] <mt> Tobbi doesn't know anything about anything
[2016/03/05 11:21:57] <ToBeFree> lol

[2016/03/05 11:32:19] <mt> whoever created that page
[2016/03/05 11:32:21] <ToBeFree> github would have created patch-1 for me if there had been any changes- oh, a guide!
[2016/03/05 11:32:23] <mt> not a good name
[2016/03/05 11:34:29] <ToBeFree> another question: When I saw the photos, I quickly created one for me using GIMP and a penguin photo (own work) - now I'm editing credits and see that photos are probably only meant for the main contributors
[2016/03/05 11:34:50] <ToBeFree> will remove the photo again unless you want me to start changing this :D

[2016/03/05 11:35:43] <Tobbi> I should create a photo of myself with a frame.
[2016/03/05 11:43:38] <Tobbi> Searching for my full name on github is like a walk down memory lane.
[2016/03/05 11:49:54] <mt> a photo of you holding a poster saying 'Doesn't know anything about anything'
[2016/03/05 11:50:33] <Tobbi> mt: Not yet, but good idea.
[2016/03/05 11:59:37] <Tobbi> mt: Can I merge the PyQT5 branch? Or did you observe any other issues with it?
[2016/03/05 12:00:06] <mt> I didn't test it any more
[2016/03/05 12:00:29] <mt> Maybe you can ask Hume2 to update a few forest things with the pyqt5 version
[2016/03/05 12:00:39] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2016/03/05 12:00:50] <Tobbi> Yeah, that makes sense.

[2016/03/05 12:18:18] <Tobbi> Maybe he doesn't understand that we don't need his advice.

[2016/03/05 12:19:21] <Tobbi> mt: I don't know.

[2016/03/05 12:29:10] <leyyin> run Forest, run!!
[2016/03/05 12:32:49] <Tobbi> leyyin: What would be the best way to store something like the following in a data structure: I have tiles with IDs that fit together (aka, blocks of numbers), and some of these tiles can be repeated within these things.
[2016/03/05 12:33:01] <Tobbi> I am not making any sense, I realize that now.
[2016/03/05 12:33:33] <leyyin> map from id to tile
[2016/03/05 12:33:43] <Tobbi> leyyin: We have that. What I mean is...argh, let me pastebin.
[2016/03/05 12:34:03] <leyyin> and if you want to reuse in a map you just store the id of that tile at x, y
[2016/03/05 12:34:20] <leyyin> you know what tile to use based on ID obviously
[2016/03/05 12:34:33] <leyyin> you want a graph structure? :P
[2016/03/05 12:35:03] <Tobbi> leyyin: I actually don't. Let's just assume I have a block of numbers.

[2016/03/05 12:35:07] <ToBeFree> done \o/
[2016/03/05 12:35:16] <ToBeFree> found two typos, one by testing
[2016/03/05 12:35:30] <ToBeFree> now I wonder which additional songs might be interesting for SuperTux
[2016/03/05 12:35:47] <Tobbi> leyyin: This block of numbers for example are the tiles of the tree.
[2016/03/05 12:35:47] <mt> We'd need new music for "Shocking"
[2016/03/05 12:36:00] <Tobbi> leyyin: Some of these IDs can be repeated to create higher trees.
[2016/03/05 12:36:03] * ToBeFree has a look at "Shocking". It's on the ice island, right?
[2016/03/05 12:36:10] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: No, forest.
[2016/03/05 12:36:14] <ToBeFree> oh!
[2016/03/05 12:36:23] <ToBeFree> how could I forget any level from that beautiful thing
[2016/03/05 12:36:28] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 12:36:33] <mt> you need the [ci skip] in all commits
[2016/03/05 12:36:45] <ToBeFree> oh noooo
[2016/03/05 12:36:46] <Tobbi> mt: If ToBeFree finds the forest world beautiful, do we still want to revamp it? :D
[2016/03/05 12:36:48] <mt> also https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
[2016/03/05 12:36:51] <leyyin> Tobbi, it is kinda hard to visualize
[2016/03/05 12:36:52] <mt> Tobbi: yes
[2016/03/05 12:36:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: One moment.
[2016/03/05 12:37:08] <ToBeFree> I loved it as child. Doesn't mean it can't be improved
[2016/03/05 12:37:22] <ToBeFree> been quite a long time since I played it the last time
[2016/03/05 12:37:22] <mt> "Please squash commits that belong together. If you forget initially, it's okay to force push to your own fork to fix it."
[2016/03/05 12:37:31] <mt> "No merge commits inside pull requests. Use git-rebase to keep your branch up-to-date."
[2016/03/05 12:37:33] <leper`> shouldn't that [ci skip] be replaced by some heuristic on the part of the ci software (if files ending in *.foo are the only change do not rebuild)?
[2016/03/05 12:37:50] <leyyin> leper`, automation, yuck :P
[2016/03/05 12:37:56] <leyyin> we are programmers after all
[2016/03/05 12:37:59] <leyyin> wait a minute
[2016/03/05 12:38:00] <leyyin> damn
[2016/03/05 12:38:08] <mt> leper`: does travis support that?
[2016/03/05 12:38:12] <leper`> dunno
[2016/03/05 12:38:23] <ToBeFree> mt, these two quotes were directed at me, right?
[2016/03/05 12:38:27] <mt> we'd probably be using it if they supported it
[2016/03/05 12:38:29] <leper`> it should, but that is something else
[2016/03/05 12:38:32] <mt> ToBeFree: yeah
[2016/03/05 12:38:46] <ToBeFree> About the typo and the addition + deletion of the image, I guess
[2016/03/05 12:38:47] <mt> ToBeFree: they're from https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests :)
[2016/03/05 12:39:09] <mt> in general, you could do this in one commit
[2016/03/05 12:39:24] <ToBeFree> yeah, I have even seen that - yet I have no idea how to do it and probably overread it because of this :(
[2016/03/05 12:39:24] <mt> it's not like the *.music file is important enough for a separate commit
[2016/03/05 12:39:41] <ToBeFree> ah right, I know how I could do it
[2016/03/05 12:39:43] <ToBeFree> lol
[2016/03/05 12:39:50] <ToBeFree> I did use git on the command line a few times
[2016/03/05 12:40:02] <ToBeFree> these have only been created using GitHub's web interface
[2016/03/05 12:40:04] <mt> if you want, I'll fix up those manually
[2016/03/05 12:40:22] <ToBeFree> only if that's really easy for you. Because what I'd do is doing the work again :D
[2016/03/05 12:40:27] <ToBeFree> this time on the desktop
[2016/03/05 12:40:41] <mt> then it's easier for me :)
[2016/03/05 12:41:01] <ToBeFree> aaah, I know, I could copy the current patch-branch of my repository over a git-clone of the original SuperTux
[2016/03/05 12:41:11] <ToBeFree> and then do a pull request, right?
[2016/03/05 12:41:17] <mt> no, no
[2016/03/05 12:41:21] <ToBeFree> :/
[2016/03/05 12:41:26] <mt> you'd use git rebase --interactive
[2016/03/05 12:41:40] <ToBeFree> I should probably learn this anyway. /me tries
[2016/03/05 12:41:49] <mt> it allows you to modify history (e.g. order, merge multiple commits into one, delete commits)
[2016/03/05 12:41:56] <ToBeFree> Oh!
[2016/03/05 12:42:07] <Tobbi> leyyin: You have two tiles, one is https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/images/tiles/goal/goal1-1.png with an ID of 1, and https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/images/tiles/goal/goal2-1.png with an ID of 2. Now, to create a template for an exit pole, you'd do something like (1 | 2) in vertical order, of course.
[2016/03/05 12:42:08] <mt> merge multiple commits into one = squash
[2016/03/05 12:42:14] <leyyin> mt, tbh those requirements to rebase and no merge commits are kinda too much for a beginner
[2016/03/05 12:42:33] <ToBeFree> I should remove the "build" folder from my current work folder, I assume
[2016/03/05 12:42:52] <ToBeFree> oh, it's in the .gitignore
[2016/03/05 12:42:56] <mt> leyyin: why does no one complain about the requirements for submitting a patch to linux/git itself then?
[2016/03/05 12:43:14] <leyyin> you are comparing apples to oranges
[2016/03/05 12:43:16] <leyyin> not the same thing
[2016/03/05 12:43:17] <mt> leyyin: also, I'd have done this, but apparently ToBeFree wants to learn something
[2016/03/05 12:43:21] <ToBeFree> \o/
[2016/03/05 12:43:27] <mt> leyyin: why do people say that even
[2016/03/05 12:43:39] <leyyin> you can't compare linux to supertux
[2016/03/05 12:43:42] <mt> if I can't compare apples to oranges, to what should I compare them then?
[2016/03/05 12:43:43] <ToBeFree> I have unstaged changes and might want to use "stash". Do I?
[2016/03/05 12:43:45] <Tobbi> mt: I'd say that SuperTux as a project is more fun to beginners than Linux is.
[2016/03/05 12:43:50] <leper`> leyyin: one has super and the other one not?
[2016/03/05 12:44:04] <Tobbi> Beginners are more likely to start hacking on supertux than they are on Linux.
[2016/03/05 12:44:04] * ToBeFree commits instead. Seems to be the thing to do here
[2016/03/05 12:44:07] <leyyin> mt, red apples to green apples
[2016/03/05 12:44:34] <mt> but what if I want to make a difference between apples and oranges?
[2016/03/05 12:44:40] <leyyin> anyways, back to Tobbi
[2016/03/05 12:44:43] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 12:45:07] <mt> ToBeFree: the build directory should actually be in .gitignore (most likely)
[2016/03/05 12:45:12] <Tobbi> leyyin: Let me illustrate something like this for the simple example...
[2016/03/05 12:45:15] <leyyin> mt, that is a metaphore to underline that you are comparing two disjoint things
[2016/03/05 12:45:24] <leper`> leyyin: food and food
[2016/03/05 12:45:24] <ToBeFree> yeah, I just checked
[2016/03/05 12:45:32] <leper`> of course you can compare that :P
[2016/03/05 12:45:45] <leyyin> sigh, do not take anything literal
[2016/03/05 12:45:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: http://pastebin.com/Sq5WGS2w So, this would be a template for a very small exit pole :P
[2016/03/05 12:45:54] <mt> ToBeFree: usually, you'd use git diff about the unstaged changes
[2016/03/05 12:46:08] <leper`> leyyin: that's quite hard to do
[2016/03/05 12:46:13] <Tobbi> Tile with ID 2 over tile with id 1, with tiles of iD 0 (means: Nothing) surrounding it.
[2016/03/05 12:46:44] <leyyin> ok, so what is your issue? :P
[2016/03/05 12:47:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, you can create bigger poles by adding more tiles with ID 2 at the bottom.
[2016/03/05 12:47:11] <Tobbi> I want to have resizable tile templates.
[2016/03/05 12:47:15] <leyyin> ok, I was wrong, it is an idiom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges
[2016/03/05 12:47:18] <Tobbi> templates for resizable objects.
[2016/03/05 12:47:25] <ToBeFree> ok, I knew what the change was. I changed it locally, built it, noticed it was good and changed it on the web interface too. Now I've done "git add *" and "git commit" with the same commit message
[2016/03/05 12:47:27] <Tobbi> I am not making myself clear here :D
[2016/03/05 12:47:37] <ToBeFree> trying the rebase command now
[2016/03/05 12:48:08] <leyyin> Tobbi, just add more 2?
[2016/03/05 12:48:12] <leyyin> and 1
[2016/03/05 12:48:22] <Ispy> [10supertux] Status for commit Fix typo found by testing! ^.^ by 07Tobias Frei: 08The Travis CI build passed 13https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux/builds/113920063
[2016/03/05 12:48:24] <leyyin> I am not sure I even understand the problem :D
[2016/03/05 12:48:26] <mt> ToBeFree: a simple rebase just rebases (replays) the commits on top of another branch
[2016/03/05 12:48:43] <ToBeFree> rebase --interactive
[2016/03/05 12:48:43] <Tobbi> leyyin: I know, but I want the user to make the pole bigger and smaller from the editor, thus I need to mark what tiles can be repeated in x and y direction.
[2016/03/05 12:48:49] <Tobbi> I wonder how to best do that.
[2016/03/05 12:48:52] <ToBeFree> sadly that lists only the local change I did
[2016/03/05 12:48:59] <mt> to modify history, you need to use `git rebase -i HEAD~<number of commits to go backwards>`
[2016/03/05 12:49:06] <ToBeFree> ah
[2016/03/05 12:49:08] <mt> or --interactive instead of -i
[2016/03/05 12:49:11] <mt> whatever
[2016/03/05 12:49:36] <mt> e.g. if you want to modify commits in the range of the last 10 commits, you'd `git rebase -i HEAD~10`
[2016/03/05 12:49:51] <Tobbi> leyyin: This is our template definition: https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/blob/smart_tiles/data/supertux/smarttiles.csv (smart tile id, name, horizontal tiles, vertical tiles, start ID).
[2016/03/05 12:50:09] <Tobbi> But there's no way to mark what should be repeating and what shouldn't.
[2016/03/05 12:50:17] <Tobbi> I am really thinking of a good data structure here.
[2016/03/05 12:50:39] <ToBeFree> added "s" in front of every line except the first. Didn't work. Retrying *after* the lines
[2016/03/05 12:51:02] <ToBeFree> oh. :D I have to remove "pick" from the others
[2016/03/05 12:51:28] <leyyin> Tobbi, I do not get it, so you map is a matrix of numbers, just put at x, y object with ID?
[2016/03/05 12:51:39] <leyyin> if you want to make it bigger
[2016/03/05 12:51:41] <leyyin> or smaller
[2016/03/05 12:51:50] <leyyin> scale on the matrix
[2016/03/05 12:52:11] <Tobbi> leyyin: I give up. My issue is too hard to explain.
[2016/03/05 12:52:30] <Tobbi> mt: Do you know what I want to achieve?

[2016/03/05 12:53:48] <leyyin> beginners and git
[2016/03/05 12:53:59] <ToBeFree> I did git pull and push, I believe that broke my efforts
[2016/03/05 12:54:08] <leyyin> do not sweat it, ToBeFree, it happened to all of us
[2016/03/05 12:54:08] @ Quit: tuxdev_: Ping timeout: 260 seconds
[2016/03/05 12:54:11] <ToBeFree> :D
[2016/03/05 12:55:08] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, assuming that I have a horizontal pole that is composed of the IDs "1 2 3". To make it larger, I could have the IDs "1 2 2 3". So, as a template I could have "1 2* 3" to show that tile 2 can be repeated.
[2016/03/05 12:55:12] <leyyin> Tobbi, why can't you place the same id on the left or right?
[2016/03/05 12:55:26] <leyyin> ah right template
[2016/03/05 12:55:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: Every ID means a 16x16 square. The graphics likely won't fit.
[2016/03/05 12:55:58] <Tobbi> leyyin: But I really want to have a way to mark tile regions (aka, rows or columns) resizable.
[2016/03/05 12:56:04] <Tobbi> or should I say repeatable.
[2016/03/05 12:56:04] <leyyin> why do you need a special data structure?
[2016/03/05 12:56:16] <Tobbi> leyyin: Not data structure. I am just not sure how to save this as a file format.
[2016/03/05 12:56:17] <leyyin> you have the map
[2016/03/05 12:56:25] <leyyin> and template
[2016/03/05 12:56:25] <Tobbi> The map is built into SuperTux.
[2016/03/05 12:56:34] <Tobbi> leyyin: I am wondering about the template format for that.
[2016/03/05 12:56:48] <leyyin> so you are asking us how to write 2* in the template? :D
[2016/03/05 12:57:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: Somewhat...Writing 2* works but only if it's a 1x2 template.
[2016/03/05 12:57:31] <leyyin> *2* :D
[2016/03/05 12:57:41] <leyyin> first * is horizontal
[2016/03/05 12:57:47] <leyyin> second * is vertical
[2016/03/05 12:57:55] <Tobbi> haha.
[2016/03/05 12:57:57] <Tobbi> Wait a second.
[2016/03/05 12:58:15] <leyyin>  do you want arbitrary numbers for scaling?
[2016/03/05 12:58:18] <Tobbi> That could actually work...
[2016/03/05 12:58:25] <leyyin> like tile 10 can scale vertical at most 5 times?
[2016/03/05 12:58:29] <Tobbi> not for what I currently have, but that's beside the point.
[2016/03/05 12:58:40] <Tobbi> leyyin: We don't have maximums for that.
[2016/03/05 12:59:06] <Tobbi> leyyin: Problem is: Sometimes, it's not 1 tile but a group of tiles that can repeat.
[2016/03/05 12:59:10] <leyyin> what does stop anyone currently to scale any tile infinitely?
[2016/03/05 12:59:29] <Tobbi> leyyin: Nothing, except sometimes repeating only 1 tile can look horrible.
[2016/03/05 12:59:39] <leyyin> right, so a group
[2016/03/05 12:59:54] <leyyin> mark the group repeatable, somehow in the template
[2016/03/05 13:00:20] <leyyin> why are u even asking me this :P, I do not know the codebase
[2016/03/05 13:00:27] <leper`> because of that
[2016/03/05 13:00:27] <leyyin> I am just a random guy on the internet
[2016/03/05 13:00:28] <Tobbi> leyyin: My current format is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SuperTux/flexlay/smart_tiles/data/supertux/smarttiles.csv
[2016/03/05 13:00:37] <Tobbi> leyyin: You know everything :P
[2016/03/05 13:01:01] <leyyin> leper`, u need advice for 0 AD? :P
[2016/03/05 13:01:06] <leyyin> 10$/hour
[2016/03/05 13:01:19] <Tobbi> So, it's template ID, description, width of template, height of template and start ID.
[2016/03/05 13:01:27] <leyyin> already told me this :D
[2016/03/05 13:01:30] <Tobbi> oh, right.
[2016/03/05 13:01:30] <Tobbi> Sorry.
[2016/03/05 13:01:45] <leper`> leyyin: Do you do enforcement too?
[2016/03/05 13:01:50] <leyyin> We can make this file beautiful and searchable if this error is corrected: It looks like row 2 should actually have 5 columns, instead of 6.
[2016/03/05 13:01:56] <Tobbi> leyyin: shut up.
[2016/03/05 13:01:59] <leyyin> https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/blob/smart_tiles/data/supertux/smarttiles.csv
[2016/03/05 13:02:09] <Tobbi> I am a minimalist. Adding False to each row just limits my productivity.
[2016/03/05 13:02:36] <leyyin> leper`, depends on your definition of enforcement
[2016/03/05 13:02:45] <leper`> well you are a vampire, right?
[2016/03/05 13:02:50] <leyyin> yup
[2016/03/05 13:02:55] <Tobbi> Everyone is where he's from.
[2016/03/05 13:03:10] <ToBeFree> Sorry to interrupt you again :D
[2016/03/05 13:03:16] <leper`> can you suck out enough blood to cause near death experiences while still keeping them alive?
[2016/03/05 13:03:23] <mt> ToBeFree: yes?
[2016/03/05 13:03:40] <leyyin> yes

[2016/03/05 13:04:06] <mt> ToBeFree: I'd just delete all the commits that haven't been fetched from the remote
[2016/03/05 13:04:19] <leyyin> Tobbi, add another column to the csv, x repeatable, y repeatable, and mark true or false?
[2016/03/05 13:04:30] <mt> i.e. just leave the commit you squashed
[2016/03/05 13:04:33] <ToBeFree> I'll pastebin the content of the interactive file- ah - well, in this folder, *all* commits have been remotely fetched
[2016/03/05 13:04:36] <mt> and remove all others
[2016/03/05 13:04:44] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, how would I know what subsets of the actual tiles is repeatable.
[2016/03/05 13:04:45] <leper`> leyyin: In that case I could offer you that blood in exchange for me not visiting you with garlic
[2016/03/05 13:04:54] <leyyin> Tobbi, ALL OF IT :D
[2016/03/05 13:04:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: grr
[2016/03/05 13:05:07] <ToBeFree> I just cloned the current patch-1 branch from my fork from GitHub
[2016/03/05 13:05:13] <ToBeFree> which contains the weird 10 commits

[2016/03/05 13:06:26] <ToBeFree> ELEVEN? :D
[2016/03/05 13:06:30] <ToBeFree> one moment
[2016/03/05 13:06:36] <leper`> yes, that's one more than 10
[2016/03/05 13:06:49] <mt> yeah, I always use more commits than I want to edit
[2016/03/05 13:06:52] <leyyin> leper`, 11 is one more than 10? :O
[2016/03/05 13:06:54] <ToBeFree> the problem is
[2016/03/05 13:07:01] <leper`> leyyin: You clearly never sold amplifiers
[2016/03/05 13:07:10] <leyyin> what, rofl
[2016/03/05 13:07:23] <mt> if you pick and don't change the order, a commit won't be affected
[2016/03/05 13:07:24] <leper`> go watch Spinal Tap now
[2016/03/05 13:07:33] <ToBeFree> http://paste.debian.net/hidden/5bb8b5db/
[2016/03/05 13:07:38] <ToBeFree> these are HEAD~11
[2016/03/05 13:07:54] <ToBeFree> I see all of mine and none else if I use HEAD~2
[2016/03/05 13:08:06] <ToBeFree> did that, replaced all the "picks" except the first one by "s"
[2016/03/05 13:08:11] <ToBeFree> now I get the error message
[2016/03/05 13:08:17] <mt> oh might be due to the merge commit
[2016/03/05 13:08:20] <mt> well
[2016/03/05 13:08:34] <mt> leave all those commits you didn't make with pick and at their place in history
[2016/03/05 13:08:35] <leyyin> Tobbi, can't green pipe (vertical) only scale vertically?
[2016/03/05 13:08:41] <mt> also, leave pick f35b1cd Add forest theme by Wansti and ToBeFre where it is
[2016/03/05 13:08:51] <Tobbi> leyyin: That is true. But there are other things which can scale on both axis.
[2016/03/05 13:08:52] <mt> the lines below that should be save to remove
[2016/03/05 13:08:57] <ToBeFree> ah, ok
[2016/03/05 13:09:03] <Tobbi> Or should I say: Parts of some templates can scale on both axis.
[2016/03/05 13:09:19] <Tobbi> *axes
[2016/03/05 13:09:24] <leyyin> Tobbi, an example?
[2016/03/05 13:09:25] <mt> ToBeFree: then, force push to the same branch
[2016/03/05 13:09:34] <mt> without a git pull before

[2016/03/05 13:10:08] <mt> the great thing about git is
[2016/03/05 13:10:13] <ToBeFree> the last cherry-pick is now empty, perhaps because of a conflict resolution. Should I use git commit --empty?
[2016/03/05 13:10:17] <mt> once you know it, it won't happen again
[2016/03/05 13:10:21] <Tobbi> leyyin: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/images/tiles/forest/hole.png
[2016/03/05 13:10:33] <mt> ToBeFree: which commit is that?
[2016/03/05 13:10:34] <ToBeFree> haha, yes, probably
[2016/03/05 13:10:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: You can make it wider as well as higher.
[2016/03/05 13:10:44] <leyyin> where is that in the template?
[2016/03/05 13:10:56] <Tobbi> leyyin: There is no template for it yet.
[2016/03/05 13:11:02] <Tobbi> But I intend to add one eventually.
[2016/03/05 13:11:08] <Tobbi> Maybe my template format just sucks.
[2016/03/05 13:11:15] <leyyin> I see that templates are just the same item multiple times
[2016/03/05 13:11:32] <leyyin> wait, is "0, Green pipe (vertical),2,2,57" a template, right?
[2016/03/05 13:11:33] <ToBeFree> mt, it's the - oh - http://paste.debian.net/hidden/ae5b43d0/   sorry for German
[2016/03/05 13:11:46] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes, but as I said, my template format sucks. I was looking for a better one.
[2016/03/05 13:11:51] <ToBeFree> I can try translating it, but I assume that you know git well enough to see what is happening
[2016/03/05 13:11:55] <Tobbi> I probably might end up listing each ID seperately.
[2016/03/05 13:12:17] <mt> ToBeFree: that commit shouldn't be in the list of commits to apply anyway
[2016/03/05 13:12:35] <mt> you want `pick f35b1cd Add forest theme by Wansti and ToBeFree`
[2016/03/05 13:12:42] <mt> and not `pick ea818a8 Add forest theme by Wansti and ToBeFree`

[2016/03/05 13:12:48] <ToBeFree> aaaaah
[2016/03/05 13:12:50] <leyyin> Tobbi, why do you use csv anyways?
[2016/03/05 13:12:57] <leyyin> json anyone :P
[2016/03/05 13:13:03] <ToBeFree> I was sure I had chosen the one you mentioned
[2016/03/05 13:13:09] <mt> (also, a lot people here speak German ;)
[2016/03/05 13:13:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: Does Python have a JSON parser built in? We used csv for other things. So I thought I might not break anything.
[2016/03/05 13:13:17] <mt> s/a lot/many/
[2016/03/05 13:13:17] <red_bot> mt meant: "(also, many people here speak German ;)"
[2016/03/05 13:13:20] <leyyin> Tobbi, yes
[2016/03/05 13:13:40] <Tobbi> leyyin: I might look into it. I could actually just specify which rows / columns can be repeated (by index)
[2016/03/05 13:13:46] <leyyin> https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html
[2016/03/05 13:13:55] <leyyin> I hope you use python 3 :P
[2016/03/05 13:14:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: I believe so.
[2016/03/05 13:14:10] <Tobbi> We even just updated to PyQT5
[2016/03/05 13:14:15] <leyyin> great!
[2016/03/05 13:14:21] <mt> I'd have trashed flexlay to /dev/null if it wouldn't use python 3

[2016/03/05 13:15:01] <mt> have you tried it, leyyin :D
[2016/03/05 13:15:14] <ToBeFree> Oh, haha, mt, I changed the "pick" to "r" for "remove", which it isn't. I just need to delete the lines. And I did read the interactive help... It just didn't appear on my screen because of the large commit list and I didn't check it again

[2016/03/05 13:15:26] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 13:15:33] <Tobbi> I tried to do the same thing with d
[2016/03/05 13:15:46] <ToBeFree> Tobbi, at least you got an error message for using d =P
[2016/03/05 13:15:52] <Tobbi> I probably did.
[2016/03/05 13:16:01] <ToBeFree> wow, that worked
[2016/03/05 13:16:04] <mt> well, I think you've learned enough git when you're done

[2016/03/05 13:17:11] <leyyin> something I hope I will never encounter :P

[2016/03/05 13:18:32] <ToBeFree> mt, "forcing" the push avoids this one? " ! [rejected]        ToBeFree-patch-1 -> ToBeFree-patch-1 (non-fast-forward)"
[2016/03/05 13:18:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: *sigh*
[2016/03/05 13:18:37] <mt> leyyin: that's nothing compared to commits with more than 60 parents in the linux repo
[2016/03/05 13:18:43] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: You will need to force push yes.
[2016/03/05 13:18:44] <mt> ToBeFree: `git push -f`
[2016/03/05 13:18:47] <ToBeFree> ok
[2016/03/05 13:18:54] <mt> so yeah, that's a force push then
[2016/03/05 13:19:06] <Tobbi> mt: Are you, by any chance, a git masochist?
[2016/03/05 13:19:19] <Tobbi> Even Linus Torvalds would rather fry a penguin than doing that.
[2016/03/05 13:19:19] <ToBeFree> I would have tried, but I was afraid of breaking it again :D
[2016/03/05 13:19:44] <leyyin> use the force ToBeFree
[2016/03/05 13:19:59] <mt> Tobbi: I don't even have committed to linux once, how should I have created a commit with 60 parents there
[2016/03/05 13:20:06] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 13:20:14] <ToBeFree> Remember, with great power comes great current squared times resistance

[2016/03/05 13:20:35] <ToBeFree> lol
[2016/03/05 13:20:52] <Tobbi> OKay, stop.
[2016/03/05 13:20:58] <Tobbi> For our own collective safety.
[2016/03/05 13:20:58] <Tobbi> Stop.

[2016/03/05 13:21:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: You know what.

[2016/03/05 13:21:37] <Tobbi> Wow only 9 commits.
[2016/03/05 13:21:41] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: Rebase.
[2016/03/05 13:21:53] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: git pull --rebase origin
[2016/03/05 13:21:57] <Tobbi> git push -f
[2016/03/05 13:22:05] <Tobbi> uh, actually...
[2016/03/05 13:22:06] <Tobbi> WAIT
[2016/03/05 13:22:15] <leyyin> standing by....
[2016/03/05 13:22:23] <Tobbi> not you, leyyin.
[2016/03/05 13:22:26] <ToBeFree> is [already?] the latest version
[2016/03/05 13:22:28] <leyyin> ABORT
[2016/03/05 13:22:48] <ToBeFree> ehh?
[2016/03/05 13:22:57] <mt> can I just fix it up myself?
[2016/03/05 13:22:57] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: Can you do git reset --hard origin/master ?
[2016/03/05 13:23:03] <mt> NO!
[2016/03/05 13:23:03] <ToBeFree> I only executed git pull --rebase origin
[2016/03/05 13:23:05] <mt> NO
[2016/03/05 13:23:08] <ToBeFree> lol what
[2016/03/05 13:23:09] <Tobbi> mt: Yes, we can cherry-pick.
[2016/03/05 13:23:34] <ToBeFree> mt, of course you can. I seem to fail :D Yet I'd continue trying
[2016/03/05 13:23:51] <ToBeFree> the NO is about the git reset command, right? Didn't run
[2016/03/05 13:24:01] <Tobbi> mt: If he reset to master, then git cherry-pick ee72926, this should work.
[2016/03/05 13:24:10] <Tobbi> mt: Am I right or am I right?
[2016/03/05 13:24:24] <Tobbi> Then force-push and we're good to go.
[2016/03/05 13:24:41] <Tobbi> leyyin: Say something in my favour.
[2016/03/05 13:24:44] <mt> but then ee72926 would disappear
[2016/03/05 13:24:55] <Tobbi> mt: It is still in the cache of git.
[2016/03/05 13:24:59] <Tobbi> Git keeps those things.

[2016/03/05 13:25:09] <leper`> if you don't run git gc nothing disappears
[2016/03/05 13:25:18] <mt> well
[2016/03/05 13:25:22] <mt> then reset to master
[2016/03/05 13:25:23] <ToBeFree> the hell--
[2016/03/05 13:25:23] <Tobbi> see!
[2016/03/05 13:25:23] <ToBeFree> :D
[2016/03/05 13:25:24] <mt> yeah

[2016/03/05 13:25:52] <ToBeFree> ...ok... you could as well tell me to rm -rf :D

[2016/03/05 13:26:15] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: After that, do git cherry-pick ee72926
[2016/03/05 13:26:20] <ToBeFree> There... is a problem...
[2016/03/05 13:26:25] <ToBeFree> I did the first changes to master itself
[2016/03/05 13:26:26] <Tobbi> What?
[2016/03/05 13:26:35] <ToBeFree> then created the branch off it
[2016/03/05 13:26:40] <ToBeFree> and made more changes to the branch
[2016/03/05 13:26:42] <mt> origin/master should be our main repo's master branch
[2016/03/05 13:26:46] <Tobbi> yes.
[2016/03/05 13:26:48] <ToBeFree> ah ok
[2016/03/05 13:26:58] <mt> by what github recommends, upstream/master
[2016/03/05 13:27:13] <ToBeFree> ("HEAD is now add 263c44a Add tobefree.jpg (own work)"
[2016/03/05 13:27:15] <ToBeFree> that's okay?
[2016/03/05 13:27:17] <mt> no
[2016/03/05 13:27:21] <Tobbi> Ah. origin is your fork.
[2016/03/05 13:27:34] <mt> `git remote add upstream https://github.com/supertux/supertux.git`
[2016/03/05 13:27:38] <mt> `git fetch --all`

[2016/03/05 13:27:46] <Tobbi> mt beat me to it.
[2016/03/05 13:27:50] <leyyin> later
[2016/03/05 13:27:56] <mt> `git cherry-pick ee72926`
[2016/03/05 13:27:59] <Tobbi> see you later, leyyin.

[2016/03/05 13:28:30] <ToBeFree> HEAD is finally at 88f798a Mark to_logical const
[2016/03/05 13:28:34] <Tobbi> Good!
[2016/03/05 13:28:39] <ToBeFree> now cherry-pick?
[2016/03/05 13:28:42] <Tobbi> Exactly.
[2016/03/05 13:29:29] <ToBeFree> you're sure that ee72926 is the way to go, not f35b1cd? Because the latter is what I was supposed to keep at "pick" before
[2016/03/05 13:29:48] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: You want this commit right? https://github.com/ToBeFree/supertux/commit/ee729268dcf647c71c7d28f1e076a431fecc7d4e
[2016/03/05 13:29:51] <mt> you can try f35.. as well
[2016/03/05 13:30:08] <mt> Tobbi: they should be the same diff, but different dates, and parents
[2016/03/05 13:30:12] <ToBeFree> ok, right, should be the same
[2016/03/05 13:30:15] <Tobbi> They are the same: https://github.com/ToBeFree/supertux/commit/f35b1cd
[2016/03/05 13:30:18] <mt> as such the commit id is different
[2016/03/05 13:30:42] <ToBeFree> I think it worked :D Now I've got to commit and push?
[2016/03/05 13:30:50] <ToBeFree> (force push?)
[2016/03/05 13:30:52] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: yes, force-push.
[2016/03/05 13:30:53] <mt> cherry-pick should commit automatically
[2016/03/05 13:30:56] <mt> then force-push
[2016/03/05 13:30:57] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2016/03/05 13:30:58] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 13:31:26] <ToBeFree> I really have to use SSH keys. Password auth becomes boring with a random one I have to copy all the time

[2016/03/05 13:33:15] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: Can you git commit --amend, then add that.
[2016/03/05 13:33:17] <mt> I'm gonna abort all pending travis builds now

[2016/03/05 13:33:36] <mt> oh I'll leave it
[2016/03/05 13:33:41] <mt> there's just two still running

[2016/03/05 13:34:05] <Tobbi> I don't know anything about either of those.
[2016/03/05 13:34:33] <mt> neovim is vim but with sane defaults and without backwards compatibility for C89

[2016/03/05 13:38:01] <mt> merge it in the command line, with --ff-only

[2016/03/05 13:38:12] <mt> as it's fast forward
[2016/03/05 13:38:14] <Tobbi> mt: If you want.
[2016/03/05 13:38:41] <Tobbi> I can as well cherry-pick the commit.
[2016/03/05 13:38:51] <mt> no
[2016/03/05 13:38:56] <mt> that changes it's commit id
[2016/03/05 13:39:06] <mt> then you'll have to add closes #3..
[2016/03/05 13:39:18] <mt> otherwise github will detect the fast-forward merge

[2016/03/05 13:44:52] <ToBeFree> but I did build this! I currently do again and want to manipulate a level file to play the music
[2016/03/05 13:45:25] <Tobbi> :)
[2016/03/05 13:45:59] <mt> it's most likely because the build couldn't be uploaded to our nightlies server
[2016/03/05 13:46:11] <mt> actually no
[2016/03/05 13:46:59] <mt> it's because the pull request's pr branch went bye-bye
[2016/03/05 13:47:13] <Tobbi> Right.
[2016/03/05 13:47:31] <Tobbi> Watched too much Matrix, haven't you?
[2016/03/05 13:48:03] <Tobbi> The speed of the music is actually a nice change compared to our other songs.
[2016/03/05 13:49:24] <Tobbi> mt: Do we actually want to use that song as the new credits music? I think it fits the general style of the game way better than the other song.
[2016/03/05 13:49:32] <Tobbi> So, for game credits.
[2016/03/05 13:49:38] <Tobbi> Instead of just forest credits.
[2016/03/05 13:50:27] <mt> We can also make a separate forest credits section
[2016/03/05 13:50:36] <mt> maybe make it like this
[2016/03/05 13:50:46] <mt> general credits in main menu
[2016/03/05 13:51:01] <mt> credits for specific worlds as extro
[2016/03/05 13:51:32] <Tobbi> Yeah, why not.
[2016/03/05 13:56:55] <ToBeFree> was that Matrix question in any way related to the music statement? lol
[2016/03/05 14:00:06] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: No, it was related to mt saying something going bye-bye.
[2016/03/05 14:00:30] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-JJuHpfN5g
[2016/03/05 14:11:23] <ToBeFree> ah, I saw all three movies, but in German
[2016/03/05 14:11:32] <ToBeFree> I don't remember that scene
[2016/03/05 14:12:23] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: I saw them in both German and English :)
[2016/03/05 14:12:30] <ToBeFree> ^^
[2016/03/05 14:12:36] <Tobbi> I prefer movies in the original language...
[2016/03/05 14:12:46] <Tobbi> As long as that is English.
[2016/03/05 14:12:49] <ToBeFree> English + English subtitles is okay for me
[2016/03/05 14:12:52] <ToBeFree> haha
[2016/03/05 14:13:08] <ToBeFree> or German + English subtitles to see what the translation misses
[2016/03/05 14:13:11] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: Are you a high school or college student?
[2016/03/05 14:13:15] <ToBeFree> did that for Star Wars

[2016/03/05 14:13:37] <Tobbi> Ah, alright.
[2016/03/05 14:13:44] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: What are you studying?
[2016/03/05 14:13:48] <ToBeFree> Electrical Engineering
[2016/03/05 14:13:49] <ToBeFree> :)
[2016/03/05 14:14:08] <Tobbi> Ah... Nice. Bachelor, I assume?
[2016/03/05 14:14:24] <ToBeFree> yeah :D [did I mention anywhere being a student, by the way? heh]
[2016/03/05 14:14:45] <Tobbi> You didn't.
[2016/03/05 14:14:46] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 14:14:49] <ToBeFree> pff =P
[2016/03/05 14:14:59] <Tobbi> Ich habe hellseherische Fähigkeiten
[2016/03/05 14:15:23] <ToBeFree> first semester nearly done, just an informatics exam left next friday
[2016/03/05 14:16:15] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: I came across this: http://praktikum.freiwuppertal.de/uniwuppertal.htm thus deducing you're a student :)
[2016/03/05 14:16:34] <ToBeFree> ah, you had a look at freiwuppertal.de :D
[2016/03/05 14:16:38] <Tobbi> Yes :D
[2016/03/05 14:16:49] <Tobbi> I am studying towards a masters degree in IT...
[2016/03/05 14:16:50] <ToBeFree> yet praktikum.freiwuppertal.de was... when I was in class 8 at school. Or 9
[2016/03/05 14:16:54] <Tobbi> hah :D
[2016/03/05 14:17:11] <ToBeFree> oh :)
[2016/03/05 14:17:22] <ToBeFree> so you had some electrical engineering too :D
[2016/03/05 14:17:27] <Tobbi> Not at all...
[2016/03/05 14:17:32] <Tobbi> We had physics and I failed physics.
[2016/03/05 14:17:36] <ToBeFree> Before I started, I was sure Informatics and IT is the same
[2016/03/05 14:17:42] <ToBeFree> now I know IT is Informatics + ET
[2016/03/05 14:17:50] <ToBeFree> oh :/
[2016/03/05 14:17:58] <Tobbi> okay, actually, it's Informatics.
[2016/03/05 14:18:02] <ToBeFree> ah :D
[2016/03/05 14:18:05] <Tobbi> I wasn't aware of the difference.
[2016/03/05 14:18:14] <ToBeFree> see, I wasn't either xD
[2016/03/05 14:18:24] <Tobbi> We also had maths and I almost failed that as well.
[2016/03/05 14:18:31] <Tobbi> Well, no, I was confused...
[2016/03/05 14:18:40] <Tobbi> Throughout writing the exam.
[2016/03/05 14:18:41] <ToBeFree> Oh, I thought Informatics is ... very mathematical
[2016/03/05 14:18:55] <Tobbi> Not at our college...You know the Akademikermangel...
[2016/03/05 14:18:55] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 14:18:56] <ToBeFree> a different kind of mathematics
[2016/03/05 14:19:01] <ToBeFree> hmm
[2016/03/05 14:19:04] <Tobbi> We had group theory...
[2016/03/05 14:19:21] <Tobbi> And all school math, just explained way more complicated.
[2016/03/05 14:19:46] <ToBeFree> which university is that? :/
[2016/03/05 14:20:06] <ToBeFree> (I might have a wrong image of informatics though)
[2016/03/05 14:20:28] <ToBeFree> I thought it's all algorithms and mathematics ;D
[2016/03/05 14:20:34] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: Fachhochschule Flensburg
[2016/03/05 14:20:39] <ToBeFree> ah :)
[2016/03/05 14:20:47] <Tobbi> So, now you know where I am from.
[2016/03/05 14:21:05] <ToBeFree> hehe, your country stores my clean driving record :]
[2016/03/05 14:21:09] <ToBeFree> country---
[2016/03/05 14:21:11] <ToBeFree> city. lol
[2016/03/05 14:21:14] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 14:21:24] <ToBeFree> was thinking about countys
[2016/03/05 14:21:25] <Tobbi> Yeah, mine as well.
[2016/03/05 14:21:39] <Tobbi> No accidents in 6 years almost.
[2016/03/05 14:22:34] <Tobbi> Oh, even more than 6 years.
[2016/03/05 14:22:46] <ToBeFree> I rarely drive :3
[2016/03/05 14:23:01] <ToBeFree> the university is near enough for me to go by foot
[2016/03/05 14:23:12] <ToBeFree> or take a bus when I am lazy
[2016/03/05 14:23:48] <Tobbi> ToBeFree: Same here, I still take the car each time.
[2016/03/05 14:23:58] <Tobbi> What is near for you?
[2016/03/05 14:24:42] <ToBeFree> 15 minutes of walking
[2016/03/05 14:24:56] <Tobbi> Okay, that is near...
[2016/03/05 14:24:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/03/05 14:24:57] <ToBeFree> or 7 minutes of walking plus 1 minute of bus driving
[2016/03/05 14:24:58] <ToBeFree> :D
[2016/03/05 14:25:10] <Tobbi> I'd have to walk for 45 minutes or so.
[2016/03/05 14:25:19] <ToBeFree> oh, that's a difference
[2016/03/05 14:25:51] <Tobbi> So, yeah, I normally take the car.
[2016/03/05 14:25:55] <Tobbi> And be there in 8 minutes.

[2016/03/05 14:42:32] <Tobbi> We should really create our own definition language. CSV is not a good choice.
[2016/03/05 14:43:13] <mt> s-exp?
[2016/03/05 14:43:18] <mt> json?
[2016/03/05 14:43:19] <Tobbi> hmmm...
[2016/03/05 14:43:38] <mt> xml?
[2016/03/05 14:43:47] <Tobbi> Probably...? I am more concerned about the "how we store this notation-wise"?
[2016/03/05 14:44:02] <Tobbi> mt: What I tried to explain to leyyin a few hours ago.
[2016/03/05 14:44:13] <mt> I didn't really read that
[2016/03/05 14:44:16] <Tobbi> We have rows of IDs that can repeat, we have columns of IDs that can repeat.
[2016/03/05 14:44:27] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2016/03/05 14:44:30] <Tobbi> And sometimes we have 2 rows of IDs that need to repeat.
[2016/03/05 14:45:09] <Tobbi> For example: a tree has a certain set of tiles, a higher tree has repetitions in the tile IDs somewhere.
[2016/03/05 14:45:20] <Tobbi> But sometimes tiles repeat horizontally as well as vertically.
[2016/03/05 14:45:28] <Tobbi> And sometimes you need to repeat 2 rows instead of one.
[2016/03/05 14:46:03] <Tobbi> or two columns instead of one.
[2016/03/05 14:46:36] <Tobbi> mt: So, if you can come up with a good notation for that, feel free...
[2016/03/05 14:47:39] <Tobbi> We could certainly define sub-tilesets.
[2016/03/05 14:51:12] <ToBeFree> I had a look at "Shocking", but I think it needs a dark, yet fast melody and probably different instruments than my piano
[2016/03/05 14:51:34] <ToBeFree> I had an idea, but I lack time to create it in MuseScore, I guess
[2016/03/05 14:51:47] <ToBeFree> will show you a crappy phone recording
[2016/03/05 14:51:55] <Tobbi> No prob.
[2016/03/05 15:07:51] <ToBeCloud> wow, I have so many tabs open that I have to navigate through them using Ctrl+(Shift+)Tab
[2016/03/05 15:08:20] <ToBeCloud> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/YHQNMonr/shocking-tobefree-supertux-idea.ogg
[2016/03/05 15:09:12] <ToBeCloud> Luckily, my keyboard's recording storage was large enough and I could record it there, then connect the recording to Audacity
[2016/03/05 15:09:36] <ToBeCloud> doesn't work for larger songs, and my keyboard disables audio output when "headphones" are connected
[2016/03/05 15:09:59] <ToBeCloud> not sure if this fits into the Shocking atmosphere
[2016/03/05 15:10:04] <ToBeCloud> it changes it completely, of course
[2016/03/05 15:10:24] <ToBeCloud> I'll modify my git build to see
[2016/03/05 15:12:23] <ToBeCloud> oh, haha, cave is non-looping already
[2016/03/05 15:12:32] <ToBeCloud> I didn't even notice
[2016/03/05 15:13:00] <ToBeCloud> (ah, the beginning of the file is the beginning of the loop. It does loop)
[2016/03/05 15:13:39] <Tobbi> mt: ^^
[2016/03/05 15:16:19] <mt> I'm not sure if that entirely-piano fits in shocking's atmosphere
[2016/03/05 15:16:35] <mt> it also seems to be a bit too "happy"
[2016/03/05 15:16:54] <mt> I mean
[2016/03/05 15:17:08] <mt> there's this danger due to the electricity and the thunderstorm
[2016/03/05 15:17:19] <mt> I can't hear that, in that concept
[2016/03/05 15:17:24] <ToBeCloud> yeah
[2016/03/05 15:17:44] <ToBeCloud> also, the level just managed to frustrate me in a way the song does not reflect :P
[2016/03/05 15:29:02] <ToBeCloud> oops. It is possible to finish "knee-deep in the depth" without taking the key
[2016/03/05 15:36:57] <Tobbi> ToBeCloud: I guess you can't.
[2016/03/05 15:43:45] <ToBeCloud> Tobbi: yes it is possible because there's a goal behind the key
[2016/03/05 15:43:59] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2016/03/05 15:44:03] <ToBeCloud> which is unneeded anyway, as the key ends the level
[2016/03/05 15:44:22] <ToBeCloud> might be a bug, I'll open an issue if it hasn't been reported
[2016/03/05 15:48:23] <Tobbi> ToBeCloud: Does it still work if you remove that, aka, does it still show an end sequence?

[2016/03/05 18:07:01] <ToBeFree> Does SuperTux have a low/high-gravity level yet?
[2016/03/05 18:07:17] <ToBeFree> I just had a look at http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Editor_Guide and one of the most basic settings is the gravity of the level
[2016/03/05 18:07:38] <ToBeFree> might be a nice gimmick. There's an air flower now, but lower gravity might be even more fun

[2016/03/06 02:43:04] <mcmic> Hello, I want to explain to someone under windows how to use the --record-demo option
[2016/03/06 02:43:28] <mcmic> Is the windows console still called cmd.exe nowadays? Can it be found easily in the menus?
[2016/03/06 02:43:39] <mcmic> What is the supertux command? supertux.exe?
[2016/03/06 02:43:48] @ Quit: Mathnerd314: Ping timeout: 244 seconds
[2016/03/06 02:43:53] <mcmic> And where are the data stored under windows ?
[2016/03/06 02:45:53] <mt> it's still cmd, yeah
[2016/03/06 02:46:09] <mt> (there's also PowerShell, but that's slightly different)
[2016/03/06 02:46:25] <mt> The installer offers an option where the data will be stored iirc
[2016/03/06 02:46:40] <mt> most likely in C:\Program Files
[2016/03/06 02:46:51] <mt> \SuperTux
[2016/03/06 02:50:44] <mcmic> mt: and what is the command?
[2016/03/06 02:51:29] <mt> there's probably only one exe in that directory
[2016/03/06 02:51:55] <mt> most likely supertux.exe, supertux2.exe or differently cased variants of those two
[2016/03/06 02:52:10] <mt> (not sure if NTFS is case-sensitive)
[2016/03/06 02:53:10] <mcmic> ok
[2016/03/06 02:53:38] <mcmic> Oh so he needs to go in supertux directory first? supertux2.exe for instance won’t work anywhere?
[2016/03/06 02:54:10] <mt> I don't think the separate directories in program files are in a global path on windows
[2016/03/06 02:54:27] <mcmic> hum :-/
[2016/03/06 02:54:43] <mcmic> Well I send a beginning of answer I’ll see of far he goes with this.

[2016/03/06 11:27:56] <Tobbi> Hello Hume2
[2016/03/06 11:28:32] <mt> Is what we're saying so hard to understand for that idiot?
[2016/03/06 11:28:50] <Tobbi> I don't know.
[2016/03/06 11:29:11] <mt> And we'll probably have to wait until tomorrow for GitHub's team to block him
[2016/03/06 11:29:27] <Tobbi> Yeah.
[2016/03/06 11:29:41] <farooghkz> whats going on mt?

[2016/03/06 11:33:25] <Tobbi> I locked #368 as well.
[2016/03/06 11:33:34] <Tobbi> Just to make sure Savsish doesn't continue there.

[2016/03/06 11:34:49] <Tobbi> farooghkz: What?
[2016/03/06 11:35:00] <Hume2> Google Translator is very bad for translating when both languages are different than English.
[2016/03/06 11:35:12] <mt> Hume2: it does it's job
[2016/03/06 11:35:25] <farooghkz> tobbi, have you ever tried supertux?
[2016/03/06 11:35:27] <Hume2> Because it translates firt to English and then to the target language.

[2016/03/06 11:35:32] <Tobbi> farooghkz: ...
[2016/03/06 11:35:33] <mt> and I don't understand why people can't press two more keys on their keyboard, instead of using "c" or "u"
[2016/03/06 11:36:21] <Tobbi> farooghkz: I am sorry, but I am not in a good mood today...this savsish guy has been annoying the whole day.
[2016/03/06 11:36:43] <Hume2> Oh really? Poor guys.

[2016/03/06 11:37:29] <farooghkz> hume2, also its bad when one of languages are eng
[2016/03/06 11:37:51] <Hume2> I know :)
[2016/03/06 11:38:06] <Hume2> Sometimes it misses to translate a word.

[2016/03/06 11:42:16] <Hume2> English->Czech translation is really terrible :D
[2016/03/06 11:42:34] <mt> I'm quite surprised Iran even allows IRC access
[2016/03/06 11:43:01] <Hume2> :D
[2016/03/06 11:44:02] <mt> They block Google and AWS, limit SSH to 5 KB/s, MITM some sites' TLS certs with a cert issued by a Chinese CA
[2016/03/06 11:44:24] <farooghkz> mt, why iran would not?
[2016/03/06 11:45:13] <farooghkz> mt, google isnt block
[2016/03/06 11:45:22] <mt> farooghkz: because as the government that already blocks things, I'd want to prevent users from communicating with people that don't like the government
[2016/03/06 11:45:29] <Tobbi> I guess I need a less complex game than 0 A.D

[2016/03/06 11:54:18] <leyyin> you are slow in building resources
[2016/03/06 11:54:21] <leyyin> most likely
[2016/03/06 11:54:42] <Tobbi> leyyin: Probably, but what else should I do: I am recruiting units as fast as I can.
[2016/03/06 11:54:55] <Tobbi> And then assigning the females to food, and the male to wood / stone / metal.
[2016/03/06 11:55:07] <leyyin> damn 0 AD is sexist
[2016/03/06 11:55:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: stop it.
[2016/03/06 11:55:18] <leyyin> better go on a twitter tumblr rampage
[2016/03/06 11:55:55] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, I wanted to explore some new territory, and built a city center to get that big stone to harvest that.
[2016/03/06 11:56:07] <Tobbi> Should've probably not done that.

[2016/03/06 14:21:01] <Tobbi> Main part of the *external* editor is written in Python.
[2016/03/06 14:21:13] <Tobbi> Hume is developing an internal editor...

[2016/03/06 14:22:51] <farooghkz> py is easier2use
[2016/03/06 14:23:00] <Tobbi> farooghkz: Py needs Python installed.
[2016/03/06 14:23:21] <farooghkz> np
[2016/03/06 14:23:46] <farooghkz> on all distros its installed
[2016/03/06 14:24:04] <Tobbi> farooghkz: Not on Windows.
[2016/03/06 14:24:09] <Tobbi> Not sure about Mac.
[2016/03/06 14:24:12] <leyyin> oython is good for scripting
[2016/03/06 14:24:16] <leyyin> not so much for games
[2016/03/06 14:24:16] <farooghkz> for win. users u can install py with st
[2016/03/06 14:24:23] <leyyin> and when you need performance
[2016/03/06 14:24:32] <farooghkz> oh k
[2016/03/06 14:24:43] <farooghkz> but its easier
[2016/03/06 14:24:45] <Tobbi> farooghkz: No.
[2016/03/06 14:24:56] <farooghkz> and takes less time
[2016/03/06 14:24:59] <Tobbi> No, it is not easier. I am used to C++ and I am not that used to Python.
[2016/03/06 14:25:16] <leyyin> farooghkz, so you use Python everywhere because it is "easier" ?
[2016/03/06 14:25:43] <farooghkz> well i dont do anything with py
[2016/03/06 14:25:57] <farooghkz> just simple scripts
[2016/03/06 14:26:08] <farooghkz> oh
[2016/03/06 14:26:43] <farooghkz> Py shouldnt be used everywhere. right?
[2016/03/06 14:27:15] <lumidify> I love Python, but most good libraries are made in C or C++.
[2016/03/06 14:27:52] <Tobbi> A good part of the supertux ecosystem consists of Python.

[2016/03/06 14:32:05] <farooghkz> i think cpp is good for gd because of its performance.am i right?
[2016/03/06 14:32:35] <farooghkz> (sry for these noob questions)
[2016/03/06 14:34:03] <Tobbi> farooghkz: If you want to, you can only just test the game.
[2016/03/06 14:34:13] <Tobbi> You don't need to use C++
[2016/03/06 14:35:05] <farooghkz> im going to be a good programmer not a potato!
[2016/03/06 14:35:23] <leper`> with c++?
[2016/03/06 14:35:30] <leper`> allocate a few years of time for taht
[2016/03/06 14:35:37] <leper`> *that
[2016/03/06 14:35:53] <lumidify> https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science
[2016/03/06 14:36:09] <farooghkz> yes with cpp and other
[2016/03/06 14:36:30] <farooghkz> np i have lots of time :)
[2016/03/06 14:36:58] <Tobbi> farooghkz: Just study the SuperTux source code.
[2016/03/06 14:37:15] <Tobbi> And when you have questions, ask me, or, preferably, ask ##c++
[2016/03/06 14:37:49] <leper`> (or read the standard and docs)
[2016/03/06 14:37:52] <farooghkz> tobbi, idk sdl, openal, opengl,etc.then just study source code?
[2016/03/06 14:38:08] <Tobbi> farooghkz: I don't know SDL or OpenAL / OpenGL.
[2016/03/06 14:38:14] <Tobbi> When I change that code, I just read docs.
[2016/03/06 14:38:20] <Tobbi> So, don't worry.
[2016/03/06 14:38:37] <farooghkz> O.o
[2016/03/06 14:38:57] <farooghkz> code have docs?
[2016/03/06 14:39:07] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/03/06 14:39:21] <Tobbi> leper`: Take over, but don't overtake yourself :P
[2016/03/06 14:39:29] <leper`> but food is ready
[2016/03/06 14:39:34] <Tobbi> okay, then not.
[2016/03/06 14:39:35] <farooghkz> supertux code is documented?
[2016/03/06 14:39:50] <Tobbi> farooghkz: No, the components we use are documented.
[2016/03/06 14:40:08] <Tobbi> There is documentation for SDL / OpenGL, all the other components.
[2016/03/06 14:40:28] <leper`> I guess there are also some comments in the SuperTux code, no?
[2016/03/06 14:40:38] <Tobbi> leper`: Depends.
[2016/03/06 14:40:47] <Tobbi> leper`: Most of the source code is pretty self-explanatory.
[2016/03/06 14:41:16] <leper`> well good names are better than outdated docs
[2016/03/06 14:41:19] <farooghkz> ok
[2016/03/06 14:42:00] <farooghkz> (sry for trolling,noobing,potatoing,etc)
[2016/03/06 14:42:33] <Tobbi> farooghkz: I don't mind.
[2016/03/06 14:42:37] <Tobbi> Not yet, at least.
[2016/03/06 14:43:39] <farooghkz> (also for fooling)
[2016/03/06 14:45:01] <Tobbi> farooghkz: Believe me, it is fine. We all start off somewhere.
