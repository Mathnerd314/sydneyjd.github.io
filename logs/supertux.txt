[2015/11/06 11:42:45] <brmbrmcar> There is no advanced HTML needed.
[2015/11/06 11:43:10] <head8debian> Karkus: its hacked together. i have crontab execute a cp command, then i have it execute a git commit and push command and i have a ssh key set up between github and my server.
[2015/11/06 11:43:23] <head8debian> Karkus: Currently it only gets dumped to 1 file.
[2015/11/06 11:43:32] <head8debian> And my website is thrown together...

[2015/11/06 11:44:55] <head8debian> I could do more...
[2015/11/06 11:46:05] <head8debian> There, now its 5 times a day... that should be better.
[2015/11/06 11:46:12] <head8debian> I really don't want to do more than that.

[2015/11/06 12:15:31] <maths22> I'm working on importing my logs from irssi, and then I will try to make a better front-end

[2015/11/06 12:16:23] <maths22> Karkus: not sure, but the really nice thing about it is that, once I finish making my script, it will be really easy to import logs from irrsi if the logserver goes down

[2015/11/06 17:02:05] <leyyin> btw, I used the travis file from supertux for the stk-editor ;)
[2015/11/06 17:02:12] <leyyin> without proper reference

[2015/11/06 17:05:30] <Karkus> Sorry
[2015/11/06 17:05:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's alright. I am not mean.
[2015/11/06 17:05:36] <Tobbi> I am evil.
[2015/11/06 17:06:00] <leyyin> Tobbi, if you are evil then I am Stalin
[2015/11/06 17:06:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: I think you should stick to torturing babies
[2015/11/06 17:06:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, yeah, we need to devise a new method...
[2015/11/06 17:06:26] <Karkus> Okay that has no context
[2015/11/06 17:06:28] <Tobbi> What about those wind turbines...

[2015/11/06 17:06:35] <Tobbi> We could couple them with cherry cake.

[2015/11/06 17:07:23] <Tobbi> leyyin: We never talked about literally torturing babies.
[2015/11/06 17:07:34] <leyyin> you live in Germany man
[2015/11/06 17:07:40] <Tobbi> And, for the most part, no one of us has ever tortured a baby.
[2015/11/06 17:07:49] <leyyin> they arrest you just for wearing an indian sign ;)
[2015/11/06 17:07:57] <red_bot> Tobbi: sure... your talking about putting 1 baby in 3 trach cans...
[2015/11/06 17:07:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: Speak for yourself :D
[2015/11/06 17:07:58] <Tobbi> leyyin: *cough*
[2015/11/06 17:08:06] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/11/06 17:08:14] <red_bot> Tobbi: According to my perfect logs...
[2015/11/06 17:08:24] <Tobbi> That's the exception. If you believe in Buddhism, it's not actually killing if the baby gets reborn.
[2015/11/06 17:08:38] <Karkus> There are advantages to not having logs too, I guess
[2015/11/06 17:08:42] <Tobbi> Wait, Buddhism, Hinduism, right?
[2015/11/06 17:08:53] <head8debian> Karkus: Haha, true.

[2015/11/06 17:26:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh c'mon...

[2015/11/06 17:33:12] <brmbrmcar> It is the United Kingdom!

[2015/11/06 17:35:08] <brmbrmcar> Why?
[2015/11/06 17:35:43] <Karkus> Why what?
[2015/11/06 17:36:07] <brmbrmcar> Do you not want NI or Wales?
[2015/11/06 17:36:43] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Where do you live?

[2015/11/06 17:37:21] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/06 17:37:26] <Karkus> and Wales, well idk I can't understand them

[2015/11/06 18:01:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: It was speculated a while ago that swimming could be implemented in supertux. Could that be a 0.5.0 thing or is it not possible due the amount of levels that rely on you being unable to swim?
[2015/11/06 18:01:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could certainly put it in the 0.5.0 release list.
[2015/11/06 18:01:39] <Tobbi> eeh, todo list.
[2015/11/06 18:01:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Which is where?
[2015/11/06 18:01:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: not yet created.
[2015/11/06 18:02:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: file a bug report.

[2015/11/06 18:02:15] <Karkus> okay
[2015/11/06 18:02:29] <Tobbi> We'd have to go through the list of levels to see which of these use water...

[2015/11/06 18:04:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe a lot of levels require you to be unable to swim... But maybe we could add a special bonus item.

[2015/11/06 18:13:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: that would be cool. :D What kind of item do you think should give tux the ability to swim?
[2015/11/06 18:13:52] <Tobbi> Because otherwise, we'd have to rework a lot of levels.
[2015/11/06 18:14:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: Flippers would be a kinda funny one
[2015/11/06 18:14:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Penguins are pretty epic at swimming anyway :P
[2015/11/06 18:14:34] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/11/06 18:15:13] <Tobbi> oh, wait. Water has never really been solid.
[2015/11/06 18:15:26] <Tobbi> So, we don't need a special item for tht
[2015/11/06 18:15:27] <Tobbi> that
[2015/11/06 18:15:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: How about this for music: https://soundcloud.com/karkus476/water-theme? Please be honest if it's bad. it's a proof of concept unfinished thing
[2015/11/06 18:16:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: we do, as many levels have water that, if you could swim in it, would make the level easy
[2015/11/06 18:16:29] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2015/11/06 18:16:33] <Tobbi> hah, confusion.
[2015/11/06 18:16:41] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, that theme plays when Tux swims?
[2015/11/06 18:16:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, in underwater levels
[2015/11/06 18:16:59] <Tobbi> Ah...
[2015/11/06 18:17:03] <Tobbi> Hmm, interesting.
[2015/11/06 18:17:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: In my opinion, it needs a more mysterious touch.
[2015/11/06 18:17:37] <Tobbi> Or?
[2015/11/06 18:17:39] <Tobbi> Let me check something.
[2015/11/06 18:17:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah, I see.
[2015/11/06 18:20:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Check what?

[2015/11/06 18:20:30] <Tobbi> Do you know Fish Fillets - Next Generation.
[2015/11/06 18:20:33] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/11/06 18:20:42] <Tobbi> The music doesn't fit well, either.
[2015/11/06 18:21:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't know it
[2015/11/06 18:21:27] <Tobbi> okay.
[2015/11/06 18:21:41] <Karkus> And which music doesn't fit well?
[2015/11/06 18:21:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: The one I linked to, above.
[2015/11/06 18:21:59] <Karkus> Oh, okay
[2015/11/06 18:22:18] <Tobbi> We need something funky, but something that is mysterious at the same time, and "underwater". :P
[2015/11/06 18:22:50] <Tobbi> On the other hand.
[2015/11/06 18:22:56] <Karkus> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xelag0YVrcs
[2015/11/06 18:22:59] <Tobbi> I just checked mario's underwater theme...
[2015/11/06 18:23:05] <Karkus> Ah
[2015/11/06 18:23:43] <Tobbi> Okay, so maybe I was too strict there :D
[2015/11/06 18:24:23] <Karkus> I get what you mean.
[2015/11/06 18:24:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could have music blocks... Things that play a certain note when you hit them :D
[2015/11/06 18:24:55] <Tobbi> And people could play around with that then :D
[2015/11/06 18:25:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: But we need a good editor :P
[2015/11/06 18:25:20] <Tobbi> *sigh* yeah, you're right :D
[2015/11/06 18:25:21] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/11/06 18:25:27] <Tobbi> That prerequisite...
[2015/11/06 18:25:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Add it to the list
[2015/11/06 18:25:42] <Tobbi> Not sure if I should or how much fun that would be :D
[2015/11/06 18:26:48] <Karkus> Tobbi: Once I've done this controls thing I'll see what I can do for the editor.
[2015/11/06 18:26:56] <Tobbi> Alright, thanks
[2015/11/06 18:26:57] <Tobbi> !
[2015/11/06 18:27:14] <Karkus> I wish Grumbel had just commented his code in the first place
[2015/11/06 18:27:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do many OS projects have documentation?
[2015/11/06 18:28:10] <Tobbi> Hmm, that's a thing I don't know. I don't normally follow that many open source projects.
[2015/11/06 18:28:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/06 18:28:26] <Karkus> I doubt it though
[2015/11/06 18:30:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: on the other hand, levels based on music will likely be hard for the hearing impaired.
[2015/11/06 18:30:26] <Tobbi> So maybe we shouldn't develop that idea further...
[2015/11/06 18:31:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: We should have a braile version of the wiki
[2015/11/06 18:31:32] <Karkus> jk :D
[2015/11/06 18:31:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: We could have subtitles
[2015/11/06 18:31:49] <Karkus> If you *really* want
[2015/11/06 18:32:04] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:32:08] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2015/11/06 18:32:23] <Tobbi> How would a music level actually look like anyway?
[2015/11/06 18:32:24] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:33:00] <Tobbi> But, yeah, braille...
[2015/11/06 18:33:01] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:33:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: But, yeah, braille, no :P
[2015/11/06 18:33:47] <datahead8888> A music based level would probably have differet notes or snippets of music play at different points that cue the player in to actions.  For visual look you could have staffs and/or notes.
[2015/11/06 18:34:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: What program did you use to compose the music?
[2015/11/06 18:34:13] <datahead8888> For the hearing impaired you would have to have text that allows them to get the hints without auditory cues.
[2015/11/06 18:34:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: Musescore
[2015/11/06 18:34:24] <Tobbi> Sounds interesting.
[2015/11/06 18:34:49] <datahead8888> Now, programming levels for the blind would be interesting.  You would need auditory cues that allow them to play in a "dark level" so as to speak
[2015/11/06 18:34:53] <Karkus> You can probably already script sounds in anyway
[2015/11/06 18:35:13] <Karkus> Echo location supertux, anyone?
[2015/11/06 18:35:21] <datahead8888> Oh, that's a good idea
[2015/11/06 18:35:32] <datahead8888> It would make an interesting challenge for people who see, too
[2015/11/06 18:35:47] <datahead8888> It would probably have to be a slow moving level
[2015/11/06 18:36:04] <datahead8888> You wouldn't want enemies that move fast and dive bomb the player in something like that :)
[2015/11/06 18:36:16] <Tobbi> Create issues, guys.
[2015/11/06 18:36:17] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:36:19] <Karkus> datahead8888: A pit would be hard enough
[2015/11/06 18:36:29] <Tobbi> Interesting thing for post 0.4.0
[2015/11/06 18:36:45] <Karkus> Everything is interesting when it's post 0.4.0 :D
[2015/11/06 18:36:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:37:19] <datahead8888> I've suggested some of this kind of stuff for Secret Chronicles before - it's all a matter of priorities
[2015/11/06 18:37:24] <datahead8888> But if you want, I could file some issues
[2015/11/06 18:38:27] <datahead8888> While you're at it, it's good to think about disability accessibility for the whole game
[2015/11/06 18:38:32] <datahead8888> What if you have a color blind player?
[2015/11/06 18:38:54] <datahead8888> Or have tones in other parts of the game
[2015/11/06 18:39:22] <Tobbi> But it's hard for colour blind people, anyway.
[2015/11/06 18:39:28] <Tobbi> Unless we filter everything in specific colours/
[2015/11/06 18:39:46] <datahead8888> Well, you'd probably focus on critical items they have to differentiate.
[2015/11/06 18:40:12] <datahead8888> It might be a bit challenging to do unless you can find a color blind volunteer to check out the game
[2015/11/06 18:42:45] <Karkus> datahead8debian: Colour blindness does not affect people that much
[2015/11/06 18:43:09] <Karkus> It's not like black and white, and supertux doesn't need colours to fucntion
[2015/11/06 18:44:00] <datahead8888> If you had text without good contrast it could become an issue
[2015/11/06 18:45:13] <Karkus> datahead8888: I guess. Maybe.
[2015/11/06 18:45:29] <datahead8888> It might not be an issue at all now, though

[2015/11/07 10:21:38] <leyyin> higher dpi
[2015/11/07 10:22:31] <Hume2> What do they expect? I don't want to see what's on my computer via a microscope.
[2015/11/07 10:22:45] <head8debian> What i have works fine.
[2015/11/07 10:22:48] <leyyin> you can see the diference man ;)
[2015/11/07 10:22:54] <leyyin> higher quality
[2015/11/07 10:22:58] <leyyin> more sharp
[2015/11/07 10:23:00] <head8debian> Yes i can, ive seen a 4k screen.
[2015/11/07 10:23:05] <leyyin> it's like looking out of a window
[2015/11/07 10:23:09] <head8debian> But my wallet cringes. :D
[2015/11/07 10:23:18] <head8debian> And i only get new when my old breaks.

[2015/11/07 10:24:11] <head8debian> Hey, im still using a 15in 1024x768px screen. :)
[2015/11/07 10:24:29] <leyyin> that is a weird resolution
[2015/11/07 10:24:36] <Hume2> I'm using 1536Ã768 screen.
[2015/11/07 10:24:48] <leyyin> are you sure it is not 1366? Hume2
[2015/11/07 10:25:03] <head8debian> My main screen is 1600x900.
[2015/11/07 10:25:22] <Hume2> leyyin: Yes, that's right.
[2015/11/07 10:25:28] <Hume2> leyyin: 1366
[2015/11/07 10:25:35] <Hume2> it is.
[2015/11/07 10:25:42] <head8debian> Only 11954 hours on it. :D
[2015/11/07 10:25:56] <leyyin> how can you tell? head8debian
[2015/11/07 10:26:14] <head8debian> My screen has a menu which tells me...

[2015/11/07 10:26:42] <leyyin> what?
[2015/11/07 10:26:50] <leyyin> what crappy tractors do you have?
[2015/11/07 10:26:57] <leyyin> I have seen tractors old as 40 years
[2015/11/07 10:26:59] <leyyin> still running
[2015/11/07 10:27:07] <head8debian> Only 40? :)
[2015/11/07 10:27:40] <head8debian> My grandpa has one from when he was 12 thats still running. :) And he is 80.
[2015/11/07 10:27:42] <leyyin> how can a tractor not run for 498 days?
[2015/11/07 10:28:08] <head8debian> Tractors don't go by the amount of miles on them, they go by hours on them.
[2015/11/07 10:28:27] <leyyin> what?
[2015/11/07 10:28:27] <head8debian> 6,000 hours on a Combine is alot.
[2015/11/07 10:28:41] <leyyin> how do they measure that?
[2015/11/07 10:29:02] <head8debian> We have a Skytrak with 12,000 hours and its its startign to show its age.
[2015/11/07 10:29:11] <head8debian> leyyin: Every tractor has a time meter...
[2015/11/07 10:29:19] <head8debian> Well, newer ones...
[2015/11/07 10:29:24] <leyyin> I do not think I saw that kind of thing here tbh
[2015/11/07 10:29:27] <head8debian> after 1980. ;)
[2015/11/07 10:30:02] <head8debian> We run relatively modern equipment because of reliabilty reasons and size.
[2015/11/07 10:30:21] <head8debian> Mdern as within the last 20 years.
[2015/11/07 10:30:46] <head8debian> You cannot cover hundreds of acres with a old "put put". :)
[2015/11/07 10:31:04] <head8debian> Wait, your not in the USA, so you wouldn't understand that reference...
[2015/11/07 10:31:16] <head8debian> leyyin: Whats the most popular tractor over ther?
[2015/11/07 10:31:20] <head8debian> there*
[2015/11/07 10:32:17] <mt> The average european is probably not interested in the popularity of tractors...

[2015/11/07 14:22:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: What kind of sponsor do you mean?
[2015/11/07 14:22:49] <Tobbi> Karkus, a VPS, probably? Something we can do automatic nightly builds on.
[2015/11/07 14:23:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: But someone has to pay for it.
[2015/11/07 14:23:25] <Tobbi> Karkus, Not if the company finds the cause worthwhile.
[2015/11/07 14:23:26] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/07 14:23:30] <Karkus> Unless you mean get an actual sponsor of supertux
[2015/11/07 14:23:39] <Tobbi> I mean: We're an open-source projects, we should be able to get someone to pay for the server.
[2015/11/07 14:23:40] <Tobbi> right?
[2015/11/07 14:24:49] <Tobbi> That's something we could need donations for.
[2015/11/07 14:25:19] <mt> With cross-compiling we could also try to get sponsors for this https://www.scaleway.com/pricing/ (don't forget VAT in EU)
[2015/11/07 14:26:58] <Tobbi> mt, Can you ask around?
[2015/11/07 14:27:12] <mt> Not sure who to ask, tbh
[2015/11/07 14:27:28] <Tobbi> mt, I mean: Ask around whether they'd let us set that up for free? We'd of course link back to them from supertux.github.io
[2015/11/07 14:27:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: You could use my server. :D
[2015/11/07 14:27:33] <Tobbi> Could give them some recognition.
[2015/11/07 14:27:38] <Tobbi> head8debian, For cross-compiling?
[2015/11/07 14:27:41] <Tobbi> head8debian, How good is it?
[2015/11/07 14:27:49] <head8debian> Well, not real good.
[2015/11/07 14:27:55] <head8debian> dual core 2.2ghz IIRC.
[2015/11/07 14:28:11] <Tobbi> head8debian, Problem is uploading stuff with your bandwidth.
[2015/11/07 14:28:15] <Tobbi> I believe.
[2015/11/07 14:28:16] <Tobbi> Right?
[2015/11/07 14:28:30] <mt> You'd not need cross-compilation on x86_64 machines, that server I linked to needs it because it's ARM
[2015/11/07 14:28:38] <head8debian> It would take a few mins.
[2015/11/07 14:29:03] <mt> Also, Online SAS is a rather big company, I'd expect more support from smaller hosting companies
[2015/11/07 14:29:09] <head8debian> But i don't care so much about upload speeds. Down is more annoying.

[2015/11/07 14:30:37] <head8debian> It does have 2gb ram.
[2015/11/07 14:30:47] <mt> Because that server's cheaper; you can cross-compile
[2015/11/07 14:31:28] <head8debian> Im not sure if it has ECC ram or non ECC ram.
[2015/11/07 14:31:28] <mt> You know that cross-compiling is for compiling code on an architecture different from the target architecture.
[2015/11/07 14:31:38] <head8debian> Yes i do...
[2015/11/07 14:32:08] <head8debian> But why do we need to cross compile?
[2015/11/07 14:32:20] <Tobbi> So that people from other OSes can get nightly builds as well?
[2015/11/07 14:32:26] <Tobbi> *using other OSes
[2015/11/07 14:32:38] <head8debian> Well, i could see 32 bit and 64 bit, but say x64-86 to ARM?
[2015/11/07 14:32:49] <mt> Nah, because if we'd build natively for ARM no-one could run the builds
[2015/11/07 14:33:22] <mt> If we cross-compile on ARM for x86_64 and i686, then you could run the binaries on "normal" computers
[2015/11/07 14:33:27] <head8debian> I could handle a couple uploads, but not more than 500mb a night.
[2015/11/07 14:34:11] <mt> Also, head8debian, why do you care about ECC? Even most x86_64 basic-level dedicated servers don't have ECC RAM.
[2015/11/07 14:34:31] <Tobbi> head8debian, The binaries shouldn't exceed 500 MB
[2015/11/07 14:34:37] <Tobbi> Maybe 250 in total or something.
[2015/11/07 14:34:39] <head8debian> Because, i could upgrade the ram if its non ECC. ;)
[2015/11/07 14:34:52] <head8debian> I haven't done any looking into the ram it has atm...
[2015/11/07 14:35:07] <head8debian> I got a mobo-cpu-ram combo and just instaleld it and started using it.
[2015/11/07 14:35:18] <mt> That server I linked to is using an ARM SoC, you can't replace RAM on SoCs.
[2015/11/07 14:35:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: But do we really *need* nightly builds?
[2015/11/07 14:35:32] <head8debian> mt: I do know what a SOC is. :)
[2015/11/07 14:35:45] <Tobbi> head8debian, No, we don't. But weekly builds could be neat.
[2015/11/07 14:36:03] <mt> head8debian: Yet you can't send them your RAM to add it.
[2015/11/07 14:36:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: But what if our development goes dead after M2 is released? :)
[2015/11/07 14:36:24] <head8debian> mt: True...
[2015/11/07 14:36:32] <head8debian> But 2gb ram can do quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:36:38] <head8debian> Not alot, but quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:36:57] <mt> As I said, I can build packaged x86_64 Arch Linux binaries manually once every week.
[2015/11/07 14:36:59] <Tobbi> head8debian, It certainly will.
[2015/11/07 14:37:21] <Tobbi> mt, Can't you cross-compile?
[2015/11/07 14:37:37] <head8debian> mt: I can to. :)
[2015/11/07 14:37:41] <mt> Cross-compile for what
[2015/11/07 14:37:47] <head8debian> mt: Arch packages are easy.
[2015/11/07 14:37:51] <Tobbi> mt, Cross-compile for win32 at least?
[2015/11/07 14:38:08] <Tobbi> Mac might be a problem.
[2015/11/07 14:38:09] <mt> Do we even support building using MinGW?
[2015/11/07 14:38:17] <head8debian> mt: I flagged the Supertux AUR package out of date, but haven't heard back. I even linked them to a updated version of it.
[2015/11/07 14:38:18] <Tobbi> afaik, we do.
[2015/11/07 14:38:55] <head8debian> Well, i would have more ram free if red_bot wasn't taking 250mb. o_O
[2015/11/07 14:38:58] <Tobbi> http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Building_on_Windows says we do with MSYS and MinGW
[2015/11/07 14:39:01] * head8debian stares at red_bot...
[2015/11/07 14:39:11] <Tobbi> red_bot stares back and wonders...
[2015/11/07 14:39:16] <Tobbi> Okay, guys, see you later.
[2015/11/07 14:39:21] <Tobbi> or rather in a minute.

[2015/11/07 14:39:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: The only thing with building is that my CPU fan is noisy. :D
[2015/11/07 14:40:22] <mt> I know that, I have so many computers I could use as homeservers, but they're too noisy

[2015/11/07 14:41:51] <Tobbi_> This project's activity has gone up quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:42:43] <head8debian> mt: my server is the last computer i use currently thats noisy, thankfully. ;)
[2015/11/07 14:43:08] <mt> but: more activity -> more bugs -> more activity -> even more bugs -> /* repeat */ :(
[2015/11/07 14:43:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, i do have another computer that we could use for this... but i don't want to. Then my room would be super really noisy. :p
[2015/11/07 14:43:40] <head8debian> mt: True... but you cannot just live with bugs.
[2015/11/07 14:43:46] <Karkus> mt: But more people to fix bugs

[2015/11/07 14:44:21] <head8debian> Its a loop...
[2015/11/07 14:44:24] <Tobbi> but also resulting in the project being sustainable.
[2015/11/07 14:44:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: How've you got two unaffiliated quotes
[2015/11/07 14:44:26] <mt> and to introduce as well
[2015/11/07 14:44:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: Uh?
[2015/11/07 14:44:46] <Karkus> Tobbi: Tobbi_ is unaffiliated
[2015/11/07 14:44:52] <Karkus> OOps
[2015/11/07 14:44:53] <Tobbi> mt: Doesn't every big open source project have that problem?
[2015/11/07 14:44:54] <Karkus> cloaks
[2015/11/07 14:44:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: yup.
[2015/11/07 14:45:01] <Karkus> not quotes
[2015/11/07 14:45:03] <mt> Karkus: if you're talking about cloaks, they will always be set when you identify
[2015/11/07 14:45:10] <mt> regardless of the nicknames
[2015/11/07 14:45:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: I have no clue how i'd set up my server to build packages like that though... the upload wouldn't be so hard. My server runs debian btw.
[2015/11/07 14:45:38] <Karkus> mt: But you need to get a cloak for each one, and an account for each one
[2015/11/07 14:45:42] <mt> Tobbi: I guess not just every big open source project, every bigger software project
[2015/11/07 14:45:51] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/11/07 14:45:52] <head8debian> Karkus: No, you group the nicks to your account.
[2015/11/07 14:45:57] <mt> Karkus: nope, you can sign in to the same account multiple times
[2015/11/07 14:46:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: Cronjob?
[2015/11/07 14:46:06] <mt> You don't even need to group nicks
[2015/11/07 14:46:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: Of course cronjob, but like to make a .deb file. ive heard they are a PITB.
[2015/11/07 14:46:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: You mean PITA? Yummy.

[2015/11/07 14:47:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: What OSes would i have to build for?
[2015/11/07 14:47:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Linux and maybe Windows. I believe, OS X is too hard to do.
[2015/11/07 14:47:53] <Karkus> head8debian: Solaris only
[2015/11/07 14:47:58] <Karkus> :D
[2015/11/07 14:48:01] <Tobbi> Solaris? urgh
[2015/11/07 14:48:10] <Karkus> I'm just kidding
[2015/11/07 14:48:19] <head8debian> mt: *should* a debian .deb work with ubuntu if its made properly?
[2015/11/07 14:48:23] <head8debian> Karkus: o_O
[2015/11/07 14:48:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: You'd have to transpile supertux into Java and create one JAR
[2015/11/07 14:48:33] <head8debian> I hate java...
[2015/11/07 14:48:37] <Karkus> head8debian: They do
[2015/11/07 14:48:42] <Tobbi> Java hates you as well.
[2015/11/07 14:48:50] <mt> Solaris, killall python :D
[2015/11/07 14:48:56] <head8debian> I use it as little as possible...
[2015/11/07 14:49:10] <Karkus> I used to like the language Java
[2015/11/07 14:49:22] <Karkus> But it's incredibly frustrating
[2015/11/07 14:49:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: careful...my bachelor thesis program is written in Java.
[2015/11/07 14:49:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: How in the world do you make a windows executable? o_O
[2015/11/07 14:49:45] <Karkus> Correction - I love Java it's the best
[2015/11/07 14:49:49] <mt> head8debian: it might work, but even a proper deb package might not work as ubuntu is not binary compatible to debian
[2015/11/07 14:50:02] <head8debian> I don't even know how to compile 32 bit on 64 bit...
[2015/11/07 14:50:05] <Karkus> head8debian: It's a mystery to everyone
[2015/11/07 14:50:13] <head8debian> lol. :-)
[2015/11/07 14:50:49] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:50:54] <mt> same applies to debian releases, e.g. squeeze, wheezy, jessie and sid, as they use different library versions, which will just break (and yes, I'm adding squeeze to the list because it's still supported)
[2015/11/07 14:51:19] <head8debian> mt: Dont forget stretch... ;)
[2015/11/07 14:51:33] <mt> I don't like testing
[2015/11/07 14:51:50] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/07 14:51:51] <leyyin> Tobbi, I write my bachelor thesis in ocaml ;)

[2015/11/07 14:52:29] <leyyin> secret :P
[2015/11/07 14:52:42] @ Quit: darkbasic: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2015/11/07 14:52:52] <leyyin> conversion from some diagrams to a session logic format, so that it easy to generate code
[2015/11/07 14:53:06] <mt> head8debian: Because it doesn't really get security updates - (old(old))stable gets fast security updates as patches; sid/unstable gets fast security updates from the latest release but testing will have to wait for the package to be in sid for some time and therefore won't get fast security updates
[2015/11/07 14:53:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: Sounds complicated.
[2015/11/07 14:53:27] <leyyin> sounds ;)
[2015/11/07 14:53:34] <Tobbi> hmm okay...
[2015/11/07 14:53:40] <leyyin> everything is simple once you know it :D
[2015/11/07 14:53:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: Believe me, writing a rudimentary transpiler was easy... :P
[2015/11/07 14:54:09] <leyyin> :D
[2015/11/07 14:54:10] <Tobbi> Still, it was torn apart by one of the profs.
[2015/11/07 14:54:11] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:54:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do you get to choose your language?
[2015/11/07 14:54:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: My prof wanted me to use...uh...yacc for that...
[2015/11/07 14:55:00] <leyyin> haha, yacc
[2015/11/07 14:55:02] <Tobbi> Karkus: But he told me something about "Compiler compiler" and I was freaked out.
[2015/11/07 14:55:09] <leyyin> or lex :P
[2015/11/07 14:55:17] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I was like: No way on earth am I gonna use a compiler compiler. I'm gonna write my own thing.
[2015/11/07 14:55:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: O_o
[2015/11/07 14:55:31] <Tobbi> It would've been easier using yacc, I believe.
[2015/11/07 14:55:46] <Tobbi> But, who cares :D
[2015/11/07 14:56:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: What did you use in the end though?
[2015/11/07 14:56:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: I wrote a transpiler in Java.
[2015/11/07 14:56:32] <Karkus> Oh, yeah
[2015/11/07 14:56:34] <Tobbi> That uses a stack and a map.

[2015/11/07 14:56:58] <leyyin> you should have used that ^
[2015/11/07 14:57:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: Uses too much memory.
[2015/11/07 14:57:11] <Tobbi> Also, it's too hairy.
[2015/11/07 14:57:12] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:57:17] <leyyin> I have my last homework for my compilers course to use lex or yacc
[2015/11/07 14:57:22] <Tobbi> I am not a yacc-ophile.

[2015/11/07 14:57:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 15:00:21] <mt> why don't you use bison if you don't like yacc?

[2015/11/07 19:14:05] <Karkus> Who is darkbasic and why do they always quit and join?
[2015/11/07 19:22:34] <head8debian> Karkus: Ask him...
[2015/11/07 19:22:36] <head8debian> ;)
[2015/11/07 19:23:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: one of them quits, the other joins, it's so easy.
[2015/11/07 19:23:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: But why
[2015/11/07 19:23:51] <Karkus> hehe
[2015/11/07 19:24:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: You know those moments when you don't know whether you want to enter a room or leave it and are stuck in the doorframe? This is no different.
[2015/11/07 19:25:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: Silently jumping back and forth through the doorframe...
[2015/11/07 19:25:40] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/11/07 19:26:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's the problem on the big channels like #freenode, so many join/part messages you have no option but to silence them

[2015/11/07 22:15:49] <datahead8888> Tobbi, did you want tickets for the music level or dark level with sound cues ideas?
[2015/11/07 22:16:08] <Tobbi> datahead8888: Yes, please. Whether we implement those is a different thing.
[2015/11/07 22:16:14] <Tobbi> Currently, I am busy with college..
[2015/11/07 22:16:16] <Tobbi> And it's 4am
[2015/11/07 22:16:43] <datahead8888> Okay, I thought you had suggested tickets earlier
[2015/11/07 22:17:10] <datahead8888> I just know that these may stay open for a while, and you guys usually seem to try to get tickets closed quickly, though maybe âI overperceived that
[2015/11/07 22:18:20] <Tobbi> No, it's exactly what we try to do.
[2015/11/07 22:18:32] <head8debian> Hey Tobbi.

[2015/11/08 12:18:51] <mt> please noo
[2015/11/08 12:19:07] <mt> try to make vector images
[2015/11/08 12:19:47] <mt> OS X, for example, uses 1024x1024 for HiDPI when 512x512 would be used
[2015/11/08 12:20:04] <brmbrmcar> But vector is bad...
[2015/11/08 12:20:57] <mt> Why is vector bad?
[2015/11/08 12:21:49] <brmbrmcar> Because it will only really be good within a certain size range.
[2015/11/08 12:21:52] <mt> It's smaller and can be scaled up without limit
[2015/11/08 12:22:05] <head8debian> mt: I do love vectors, but i would need to redo tux from scratch, which i wasnt planning on doing. the bitmap trace tool is still not very good.
[2015/11/08 12:22:25] <head8debian> Cannot .png do something similar?
[2015/11/08 12:22:37] <brmbrmcar> It is useful in enlarging, but should be modified heavily.
[2015/11/08 12:23:07] <mt> brmbrmcar: that's because vector graphics show exactly what you told them. If you don't include details it may look ugly when big.
[2015/11/08 12:23:40] <brmbrmcar> I k-now.
[2015/11/08 12:24:02] <brmbrmcar> I think we should just use the on in the repository.
[2015/11/08 12:24:14] <brmbrmcar> It's way better than any others.

[2015/11/08 12:28:30] <mt> head8debian: you can also try writing the svg in a text editor

[2015/11/08 13:42:42] <brmbrmcar> Use that.
[2015/11/08 13:42:50] <brmbrmcar> Trial it now.
[2015/11/08 13:43:04] <brmbrmcar> I can test it after.
[2015/11/08 14:13:27] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ping!!!!! PING@!
[2015/11/08 14:13:32] <Tobbi> calm down.
[2015/11/08 14:13:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: what?
[2015/11/08 14:13:55] <head8debian> PedroCosta: Feel free to ask Tobbi What you need answers to. :)
[2015/11/08 14:14:05] <brmbrmcar> CTCP PING reply from Tobbi: 0.531 seconds
[2015/11/08 14:14:12] <Tobbi> Stop it.
[2015/11/08 14:14:33] <brmbrmcar> Only did it once!
[2015/11/08 14:15:37] <PedroCosta> Will do!
[2015/11/08 14:15:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: He is talking to me in PM...
[2015/11/08 14:16:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: And he is going to try to talk to you now...

[2015/11/08 14:18:35] <PedroCosta> Trying to do a SuperTux deployment diagram, and wanted to know the kind of connection the PC establishes to get those. And what it connects to (is it a webserver) ?
[2015/11/08 14:18:42] <PedroCosta> the addons and maps
[2015/11/08 14:18:56] <Tobbi> PedroCosta: It's a github repository that gets queried.

[2015/11/09 11:51:22] <Karkus> I managed (by accident) to get a profile with a map messed up like this. But your commit doesn't fix it, it just stops it from occurring
[2015/11/09 11:51:26] <Karkus> Which is better

[2015/11/09 11:53:00] <Tobbi> Yes, but maybe someone else will tell us when it reoccurs.
[2015/11/09 11:53:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: Precisely
[2015/11/09 11:53:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, testing all paths leading to the current position might be the correct way, though that would be much more difficult.

[2015/11/09 12:03:22] <mt> I already described that in the issues tho
[2015/11/09 12:04:11] <mt> That library-version issue is also what can happen when you upgrade systems partially

[2015/11/09 12:15:49] <Tobbi> good
[2015/11/09 12:16:16] <mt> What you described would be possible, but it's not really ok to install the library in a path where the user doesn't want it installed, without confirmation

[2015/11/09 12:18:52] <mt> what can be done to fix the version-related issue is versioning the library in the filename
[2015/11/09 12:18:55] <mt> like:
[2015/11/09 12:18:58] <mt> lrwxrwxrwx 1    24 Nov  2 23:28 /usr/lib/libavformat.so -> libavformat.so.56.40.101*
[2015/11/09 12:18:59] <Karkus> mt: But isn't there a better place that is more universal among the linux distros
[2015/11/09 12:19:00] <mt> lrwxrwxrwx 1    24 Nov  2 23:28 /usr/lib/libavformat.so.56 -> libavformat.so.56.40.101*

[2015/11/09 12:19:47] <mt> the right place would be /lib, but if the user says "install to prefix /a/b/c" then we shouldn't install something somewhere else

[2015/11/09 12:27:24] <Karkus> I'm thinking SuperTree
[2015/11/09 12:27:27] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/09 12:27:58] <Tobbi> SuperVelociraptor.

[2015/11/09 12:28:11] <Tobbi> Or something.

[2015/11/09 12:30:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: The changes I'm making in https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/184 are quickly becoming quite incompatible with the previous version. It's backwards compatible, but not foreward compatible
[2015/11/09 12:30:27] <Karkus> by which I mean it could screw people's configs

[2015/11/09 12:30:39] <Karkus> If they try to use an older version
[2015/11/09 12:30:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: You could always copy the file over if it exists in the old location?
[2015/11/09 12:30:51] <Tobbi> Or rather move it, don't kno.

[2015/11/09 12:31:20] <Tobbi> Okay, good!
[2015/11/09 12:31:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: but if someone decides they prefer 0.3.6 and go back, they'll lose their settings.
[2015/11/09 12:32:12] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2015/11/09 12:32:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, copying is not the same as moving, right?
[2015/11/09 12:32:34] <Tobbi> So, if you keep the old file...?
[2015/11/09 12:33:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Good idea. I'll use a 'profile' file to store the current profile.
[2015/11/09 12:33:45] <Tobbi> :-) alright
[2015/11/09 12:33:57] <Karkus> Then old 'config' can stick around
[2015/11/09 12:34:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: We just need to make sure that people don't mistakenly try to alter their old config.
[2015/11/09 12:36:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'll get it to add a comment warning that this is a 0.3.6 config file and is ignored by 0.4.0
[2015/11/09 12:36:37] <Tobbi> Sure! That sounds good. Hopefully it's not too complicated.

[2015/11/09 14:02:06] <Tobbi_> though I should probably add it.
[2015/11/09 14:02:08] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I didn't want to ping you :)

[2015/11/09 14:05:14] <Tobbi_> Karkus, It's alright... :P
[2015/11/09 14:05:27] <Tobbi_> Karkus, You know, sometimes I overload people with work, for the sake of doing it.
[2015/11/09 14:05:29] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Oh, haha
[2015/11/09 14:05:35] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I don't mind
[2015/11/09 14:05:51] <Tobbi_> Karkus, I do. Because I am rather worried about people getting overworked.
[2015/11/09 14:06:04] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I'm not overworked
[2015/11/09 14:06:17] <Karkus> We have a deadline, and it needs meeting
[2015/11/09 14:06:22] <Tobbi_> Karkus, I know, but it can get that way too fast when you're getting overinvolved. :-)
[2015/11/09 14:06:34] <Tobbi_> I know that from my Mozilla contributor days.
[2015/11/09 14:06:43] <Karkus> I can add it to my new todo list http://swapoff.org/devtodo.html
[2015/11/09 14:06:46] <Tobbi_> But it's good that you'll take a break when you feel like it ;)

[2015/11/10 12:18:37] <Hume2> Hello, head8debian!
[2015/11/10 12:19:07] <Hume2> Someone should exterminate Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 12:19:48] <head8debian> Hume2: Nah, just windows.
[2015/11/10 12:20:08] <head8debian> Microsoft hasdone some cool things.
[2015/11/10 12:21:09] <Hume2> Just wait 70 years until the copyright laws will run out.
[2015/11/10 12:21:48] <Hume2> I read what Windows 10 everything does. I just feel a big rage.
[2015/11/10 12:21:48] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:21:53] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/10 12:22:03] <head8debian> Karkus: o_O
[2015/11/10 12:22:18] <Karkus> head8debian: What?
[2015/11/10 12:22:42] @ Quit: alket: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2015/11/10 12:23:00] <Hume2> When Windows10 spies all the computers, it should work vice-versa too.
[2015/11/10 12:23:34] <Karkus> head8debian:idk how we do the windows builds.
[2015/11/10 12:24:51] <head8debian> Karkus: Good question.
[2015/11/10 12:24:53] <head8debian> Hume2: :D
[2015/11/10 12:25:03] <Hume2> Karkus: Please don't. Windows is a spyware.
[2015/11/10 12:25:28] <head8debian> Windows is a pile of crud, but people use it, so we have to also.
[2015/11/10 12:25:41] <Hume2> No, we don't have to.
[2015/11/10 12:26:10] <Hume2> Yes, people are monkeys, even I am a monkey. Monkeys must do the same as the others.
[2015/11/10 12:26:40] <head8debian> We can support it, but it doesn't mean we have to use it ourselves. :)
[2015/11/10 12:27:00] <Hume2> Yes.
[2015/11/10 12:27:19] <Hume2> It needs to hack the camera to send some random faces.
[2015/11/10 12:27:29] <head8debian> I do use it, and what little i don't like...
[2015/11/10 12:27:34] <Hume2> Don't you know how to make a random face generator?
[2015/11/10 12:27:55] <head8debian> Ehm, no?
[2015/11/10 12:28:26] <Hume2> I think, messing up Microsoft's server with junk data could work.
[2015/11/10 12:28:34] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/10 12:28:57] <head8debian> How are you going to mess up their servers when they use linux? :p
[2015/11/10 12:29:07] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 12:29:36] <Hume2> Well, let's start milions virtual machines with windows 10.
[2015/11/10 12:29:54] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 264 seconds
[2015/11/10 12:30:04] <Hume2> Well, that's not a good idea.
[2015/11/10 12:30:14] <head8debian> It would take more like billions...
[2015/11/10 12:31:01] <Hume2> Do you think that they have any backups of that spy-data?
[2015/11/10 12:32:35] <Hume2> I read that a new type of viruses have been invited. They install your OS as a virtual machine, so you can't get that they are even on your computer. Any way.
[2015/11/10 12:34:37] <Hume2> They could then send fake data to the camera and keyboard.
[2015/11/10 12:35:31] <Hume2> ...but no idea how to make those viruses...
[2015/11/10 12:36:38] <brmbrmcar> Awesome hacks!
[2015/11/10 12:40:05] <brmbrmcar> On a Microsoft e-mail account, I think that you can change your name to a script, possibly accessing more scripts that could destroy the servers.
[2015/11/10 12:40:54] <Hume2> I guess that special characters are blocked, so that wouldn't work. However, it could be good if that worked.
[2015/11/10 12:43:17] <brmbrmcar> It allows all xharacters.
[2015/11/10 12:45:58] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I think that it just displays those characters, but they are saved another way.
[2015/11/10 12:47:10] <Hume2> Anyway, it would have to run that script somehow. And I don't think that their software is equiped to run the scripts from usernames.
[2015/11/10 12:48:31] @ bb010g joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:48:59] <head8debian> Just drop a bomb on one of their server rooms...
[2015/11/10 12:49:45] <Hume2> That works too, but it's quite too simple.
[2015/11/10 12:51:11] <Hume2> Anyway, when it sends the users' photos, it can measure the dimensions of their skull.
[2015/11/10 12:51:40] <brmbrmcar> I know it works to run scripts to make you an admin.
[2015/11/10 12:51:55] <Hume2> So they know, what race you are and where you live. Doesn't it resemble you anything?
[2015/11/10 12:52:39] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes, but some kind of boss must make you an admin. And there are tons of passwords.
[2015/11/10 12:53:48] <brmbrmcar> I mean, the develpors surely use some sort of GUI.
[2015/11/10 12:54:28] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:54:41] <Hume2> Yes, that's it. You'd have to force a developer to make you an admin.
[2015/11/10 12:55:02] <brmbrmcar> I'll try and find a video of the hack.
[2015/11/10 12:56:32] <brmbrmcar> I cannot find it. Probably taken down.
[2015/11/10 13:00:00] <Hume2> Do you think that they could misuse the data to make a genocide?
[2015/11/10 13:01:03] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/10 13:01:09] <brmbrmcar> But they wouldn't.
[2015/11/10 13:01:48] <Hume2> Could we be sure?
[2015/11/10 13:03:45] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/10 13:03:59] <brmbrmcar> We need to destroy Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 13:04:11] <brmbrmcar> Before they destroy one of us.
[2015/11/10 13:04:39] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2015/11/10 13:05:08] <Hume2> It needs something easy and effective.
[2015/11/10 13:08:24] @ Wuzzy joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 13:09:06] <Hume2> What about funny wideos with anti-Windows theme? Can it ever become popular?
[2015/11/10 13:12:12] <Hume2> What about a new SuperTux sign with crossed Windows logo?
[2015/11/10 13:12:34] <brmbrmcar> Supertux logo!
[2015/11/10 13:12:47] <brmbrmcar> No Apple builds either.
[2015/11/10 13:13:01] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: We need Tobbi though
[2015/11/10 13:14:50] <Hume2> I like those anti-Windowsish memes, they are so funny!
[2015/11/10 13:15:49] <Hume2> Automatic updates on Windows 8: Changing shape, don't turn off the computer.
[2015/11/10 13:16:17] <Hume2> Widows 8 causes the global warming.
[2015/11/10 13:16:38] <brmbrmcar> It certainally contributes to it.
[2015/11/10 13:17:54] <Hume2> Windows 8 needs a bazilion of ventilators to don't melt.
[2015/11/10 13:18:49] <brmbrmcar> Windows 8 overheats computers.
[2015/11/10 13:18:52] <Hume2> One pin of procesor has melted down. If not, correct it.
[2015/11/10 13:19:36] <Hume2> Your RAM is not supprted. Try DDR6 or newer.
[2015/11/10 13:24:10] <brmbrmcar> Please make this freezer colder.
[2015/11/10 13:25:44] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:28:30] <brmbrmcar> My laptop is fanless and has never overheated.
[2015/11/10 13:28:53] <brmbrmcar> Windows computers overheat in Antarctica.
[2015/11/10 13:28:58] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:29:31] <Hume2> Is it allowed to stick anti-Windowsish memes on the streats?
[2015/11/10 13:30:49] <brmbrmcar> Maybe.

[2015/11/10 13:31:55] <Hume2> It can't be a comparing ad, so there can't be any advertisement to any other system.
[2015/11/10 13:32:58] <brmbrmcar> How about advertise Windows, but make it bad?
[2015/11/10 13:33:42] <Hume2> Yes, like an ad, that will freak out more likely.
[2015/11/10 13:34:01] <brmbrmcar> Like Windows 10. Want to be hacked?
[2015/11/10 13:34:11] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:34:50] <Hume2> Or something that will not metion that it's about Windows, but still freaking out of it.
[2015/11/10 13:35:13] <Hume2> For example, there will be "Blindous 10" instead of "Windows 10".
[2015/11/10 13:35:32] <brmbrmcar> HP Stream. The 200 euro brick.
[2015/11/10 13:35:42] <Hume2> What's that?
[2015/11/10 13:36:25] <brmbrmcar> It is a cheap Chromebook competitor that runs Windows.

[2015/11/10 14:10:40] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Do you know personally anyone who tells that Windows 10 is good?
[2015/11/10 14:11:44] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Only kids like Windows 10.
[2015/11/10 14:11:55] <brmbrmcar> And Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 14:12:21] <Hume2> Just find someone who will stick those things across the streats.
[2015/11/10 14:13:04] <brmbrmcar> Easy.
[2015/11/10 14:13:28] <Hume2> Narre could do that :D
[2015/11/10 14:13:55] <Hume2> Don't ever tell him that I mentioned him, he doesn't like it.
[2015/11/10 14:14:17] <Hume2> Sometimes at night...
[2015/11/10 14:14:32] <Hume2> And watch out the hidden cameras.
[2015/11/10 14:16:37] <brmbrmcar> If he did it carefully, he could probably do it in a blindspot.
[2015/11/10 14:17:20] <Hume2> If I was sure that noone could see me, I'd do it.
[2015/11/10 14:19:26] <Hume2> I could stick some to the bus stops those are already sticked by many stuff.
[2015/11/10 14:20:05] <brmbrmcar> I was thinking of bus stops.
[2015/11/10 14:21:53] <Hume2> Do you think that it could have any effect?
[2015/11/10 14:22:02] <brmbrmcar> Possibly.
[2015/11/10 14:22:11] <Hume2> Same for me.
[2015/11/10 14:22:59] <brmbrmcar> Maybe if it was very high quality, people wouldn't take it as much of a joke.
[2015/11/10 14:23:19] <brmbrmcar> And at the bottom write on legal stuff.
[2015/11/10 14:24:26] <Hume2> Yes. I think that there should be also someting that is called "Blindous 10". I could be really whatever, even an application that throws an error and closes.
[2015/11/10 14:24:46] <Hume2> And it must be for free.
[2015/11/10 14:25:18] <brmbrmcar> Open source.
[2015/11/10 14:25:35] <Hume2> Why not?
[2015/11/10 14:26:52] <brmbrmcar> Indeed.
[2015/11/10 14:28:57] <Hume2> Well, is there something that it could contain in addition?
[2015/11/10 14:30:54] <Hume2> I think that the people should notice it, so I wouldn't add much detail.
[2015/11/10 14:32:26] <Hume2> Is there a possibility that it would be in TV?
[2015/11/10 14:32:41] <brmbrmcar> How much does it cost?
[2015/11/10 14:34:09] <Hume2> Well, it costs one piece of paper and some glue. Not much.

[2015/11/11 11:42:30] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: So why the level andrews_island_level6.stl has a castle background?
[2015/11/11 11:42:40] <brmbrmcar> Will fix.
[2015/11/11 11:42:57] <brmbrmcar> I also noticed a couple of things I forgot.
[2015/11/11 11:43:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: ;( My neighbor down the road has 10mb/s internet. And im stuck on 3 with a unreliable ISP. :( :p
[2015/11/11 11:43:01] <maths22> Also, I have discovered my RPM build does nto work
[2015/11/11 11:43:08] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:43:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Ask them to upgrade you.
[2015/11/11 11:43:25] <maths22> Tobbi: what version of OSX are you on?
[2015/11/11 11:43:47] <Tobbi> maths22: 10.11.1
[2015/11/11 11:44:13] <maths22> OK.  That actually may be why it doesn't work
[2015/11/11 11:44:27] <maths22> I'll see if I can test/debug on a machine with El Capitan
[2015/11/11 11:45:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, they wouldn't because the person with the tower chose their most expensive plan. :D
[2015/11/11 11:45:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh? :D
[2015/11/11 11:45:44] <Tobbi> I see.
[2015/11/11 11:45:56] <head8debian> $120/month...
[2015/11/11 11:46:49] <head8debian> I have better upload speeds then them yet though. :D
[2015/11/11 11:47:37] <maths22> Tobbi: What kind of error do you get?
[2015/11/11 11:49:02] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: the level 5 was unlaunchable, so I corrected it.
[2015/11/11 11:49:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: And i suposably have a bandwidth cap which ive never seen implemented when ive gone 5 times over it...
[2015/11/11 11:49:20] <Tobbi> maths22: you can't open the application because it may be damaged or incomplete
[2015/11/11 11:49:28] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:49:40] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You can edit the infoblock's message by editor. It's called "edit script", but it's the message in fact.
[2015/11/11 11:49:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: roughtly 100gb. :p
[2015/11/11 11:49:53] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:50:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't have a bandwidth cap, fortunately.
[2015/11/11 11:50:06] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: I k-now.
[2015/11/11 11:50:08] <head8debian> :)
[2015/11/11 11:50:16] <maths22> Tobbi: see http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/58086
[2015/11/11 11:50:19] <brmbrmcar> How do you change the font though?
[2015/11/11 11:50:33] <maths22> Do you have that set to Anywhere, or something else?
[2015/11/11 11:50:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: Your a city slicker... i live in the middle of knowwhere, 10 miles from decent internet. Ok, more like 3. :p
[2015/11/11 11:50:42] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You put the formating char to the begining.
[2015/11/11 11:50:52] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: # stands for normal text.
[2015/11/11 11:50:58] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/11 11:51:07] <brmbrmcar> Didn't know that.
[2015/11/11 11:51:15] * head8debian should just start running fiber from house to house out here... then set up a cache server...
[2015/11/11 11:51:20] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: - stands for big text, space is small text and tab is blue text.
[2015/11/11 11:51:51] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: ! stands for image and any other char is black text.
[2015/11/11 11:53:22] <Tobbi> maths22: Hmm, supertux opens just fine when I double-click on the contained executable.
[2015/11/11 11:53:37] <maths22> That is what I expected
[2015/11/11 11:53:48] <maths22> It is a silly OS X security issue type of thing
[2015/11/11 11:53:57] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: For the level 5, it's nice. Just take a look at note 5 or 4. You can just add some poles so the wood won't levitate.
[2015/11/11 11:54:08] <Tobbi> maths22: No, the issue is still there, even if I disable that thingy from above.
[2015/11/11 11:54:22] <maths22> Tobbi: I figured
[2015/11/11 11:55:18] <maths22> I'll try to fix that this afternoon
[2015/11/11 11:56:00] <maths22> I also need to change linux so it includes the libraries in the package
[2015/11/11 11:56:39] <Tobbi> maths22: So, do you know what's wrong then?
[2015/11/11 11:57:20] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: level6, We have a cave background, even a cave music, so you can use it.
[2015/11/11 11:57:32] <maths22> Not sure, but since it is not an El Capitan specifc issue, I should be able to debug it
[2015/11/11 11:57:56] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/11 11:59:04] <maths22> Can you try editing the Info.plist so that CFBundleExecutable is SuperTux and not supertux2?
[2015/11/11 12:00:00] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: For level6, take a look at notes 4, 5, 6, 14 and 31.
[2015/11/11 12:00:43] <Tobbi> maths22: 11.11.15 17:58:06,159 lsd[367]: LaunchServices: Could not store lsd-identifiers file at /private/var/db/lsd/com.apple.lsdschemes.plist
[2015/11/11 12:00:48] <Tobbi> That's what I get.
[2015/11/11 12:00:53] <Tobbi> Not sure if it helps you in any way.
[2015/11/11 12:02:33] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: OK.
[2015/11/11 12:03:29] <maths22> Tobbi: thanks.  I'll take a look later on my school's machines
[2015/11/11 12:03:34] <Tobbi> Sure.

[2015/11/11 12:28:39] <maths22> Ideally, more of our version numbers would be in the same place (so we don't have to go tracking each of them down to update the version)

[2015/11/11 12:45:43] <Tobbi> Apparently I didn't exceed the character count.
[2015/11/11 12:45:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: what_
[2015/11/11 12:45:46] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/11/11 12:46:31] <head8debian> Im tryign to set up squid with 2 ethernet cards and nano... :p
[2015/11/11 12:46:33] <mt> no https (or at least hashes) for the nightly builds?
[2015/11/11 12:46:56] <Tobbi> ask maths22
[2015/11/11 12:47:18] <mt> next week you'll have no execuse for not supporting TLS (https://letsencrypt.org/) :P
[2015/11/11 12:47:55] <Tobbi> great!
[2015/11/11 12:51:35] <brmbrmcar> maths22: How do I install the linux tar.gz file?
[2015/11/11 12:53:50] <Tobbi> maths22, head8debian, Karkus, mt: What do you guys think? http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=6630
[2015/11/11 12:55:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: Great!
[2015/11/11 12:55:59] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 12:56:04] <Tobbi> So there's that.
[2015/11/11 12:56:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: The only thing on that list which has remained unaffected by this project is my cat
[2015/11/11 12:56:50] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 12:58:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: If I had a cat, I believe, I'd try Schroedinger's experiment with it.
[2015/11/11 12:58:47] <Tobbi> So, it's good that I don't have one.
[2015/11/11 12:58:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah
[2015/11/11 12:59:13] <Karkus> Probably
[2015/11/11 12:59:48] <Karkus> Not a very interesting experiment really though is it Tobbi?
[2015/11/11 13:00:09] <Karkus> Outcomes 1) Cat ded 2) Cat live
[2015/11/11 13:00:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: Not as interesting as the Babies-in-the-dishwasher experiment. Exactly!
[2015/11/11 13:00:42] <Tobbi> While the babies-in-the-dishwasher experiment has a multitude of different outcomes, fractures, amount of blood etc.
[2015/11/11 13:01:03] <Karkus> And all of them are super exciting!
[2015/11/11 13:01:26] <Tobbi> For sure!
[2015/11/11 13:01:37] <brmbrmcar> Poor babies.
[2015/11/11 13:03:34] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: No, wrong. Poor dishwasher, rather.
[2015/11/11 13:03:36] <Karkus> Well, older rich people don't submit themse as willing volunteers
[2015/11/11 13:03:43] <Karkus> themselves*
[2015/11/11 13:06:29] <brmbrmcar> How about my method of harming babies?
[2015/11/11 13:06:36] <brmbrmcar> No restraint.
[2015/11/11 13:06:39] <brmbrmcar> Crash!
[2015/11/11 13:08:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: You, know what's best about nightly builds?
[2015/11/11 13:09:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: what?

[2015/11/11 13:09:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: good? I think that's a bad thing :D
[2015/11/11 13:09:44] <Tobbi> Meaning more bugs for all of us.
[2015/11/11 13:09:50] <Tobbi> But wait, we had that topic, already.
[2015/11/11 13:10:16] <brmbrmcar> Bugs are good.

[2015/11/11 13:15:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Shall I close it?
[2015/11/11 13:15:17] <mt> maths22: please - try to link the linux binaries statically, else it will break on distros that don't use the same library versions as the build system's distro
[2015/11/11 13:15:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: You could. I wonder how often maths22 is willing to build these, but, yeah, go ahead.
[2015/11/11 13:16:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: Manually built?
[2015/11/11 13:16:10] <mt> maths22: like "games/supertux2: error while loading shared libraries: libGLEW.so.1.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory", I'm already using glew-1.13.0
[2015/11/11 13:16:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, I mean "trigger a build", afaik he still has to do it.
[2015/11/11 13:16:41] <brmbrmcar> ./supertux2: error while loading shared libraries: libtinygettext.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[2015/11/11 13:17:00] <mt> brmbrmcar: yeah that's because it's not statically linked
[2015/11/11 13:17:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, it can't be considered a nightly release then...
[2015/11/11 13:17:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: hmm, right....but maybe he is willing to build them every day.
[2015/11/11 13:17:35] <mt> Karkus: well, you can write a cronjob triggering it every night
[2015/11/11 13:17:55] <Tobbi> I could've labeled them developer releases, but that would be confusing.
[2015/11/11 13:18:00] <brmbrmcar> mt:So what do I have to do?
[2015/11/11 13:18:25] <mt> brmbrmcar: wait until the builds are statically linked
[2015/11/11 13:18:54] <brmbrmcar> What can I do in the meantime? Do i have to build tinygettext?
[2015/11/11 13:19:02] <Karkus> mt: But does he want to? (or rather will he?)
[2015/11/11 13:19:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah, not that
[2015/11/11 13:19:50] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Why do you depend on developer releases. You know how to build supertux, don't you?
[2015/11/11 13:20:20] <brmbrmcar> Not really.
[2015/11/11 13:20:37] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You never built supertux yourself?
[2015/11/11 13:20:39] <brmbrmcar> I don't know how to build sdl 2.03.
[2015/11/11 13:20:48] <brmbrmcar> I used the ppa.
[2015/11/11 13:20:48] <Tobbi> Do you need to build it?
[2015/11/11 13:20:54] <Tobbi> So, where's the problem?
[2015/11/11 13:20:55] <brmbrmcar> On Ubuntu.
[2015/11/11 13:21:07] <brmbrmcar> All sorts of bugs.
[2015/11/11 13:21:20] <brmbrmcar> And this was on my previous Ubuntu install.
[2015/11/11 13:21:22] <mt> Building on Ubuntu works just fine
[2015/11/11 13:21:35] <mt> Travis builds are running on ubuntu
[2015/11/11 13:21:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe we should assemble a WIP release notes document.
[2015/11/11 13:21:53] <Tobbi> And make it organization-visible only for now.
[2015/11/11 13:22:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: On Google docs for example?
[2015/11/11 13:22:21] <Karkus> Or what and how?
[2015/11/11 13:22:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: I wonder if Github allows you to do secret wiki pages?
[2015/11/11 13:22:28] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/11 13:22:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Secret gist?
[2015/11/11 13:22:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: I like this idea very much.
[2015/11/11 13:22:54] <Tobbi> That might work!
[2015/11/11 13:23:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: It doesn't have to be secret...
[2015/11/11 13:23:24] <Tobbi> Sure, I just don't want people to assume this is an actual release right now.
[2015/11/11 13:23:30] <Tobbi> So, yeah, indeed, there's nothing secret about it.
[2015/11/11 13:24:22] <brmbrmcar> So I can't see it!
[2015/11/11 13:25:06] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What?
[2015/11/11 13:25:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Are you drafting the gist or shall I?
[2015/11/11 13:25:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: How do I create a gist as SuperTux?
[2015/11/11 13:25:32] <Tobbi> Ah, one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:25:34] <brmbrmcar> I won't be able to see it!
[2015/11/11 13:25:44] <brmbrmcar> It is a secret.
[2015/11/11 13:25:58] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: We'll see.
[2015/11/11 13:26:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: Having a secret gist would be a little complex
[2015/11/11 13:26:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, anyone with the url could see it
[2015/11/11 13:26:38] <Karkus> but the URL wouldn't have to be publiv
[2015/11/11 13:26:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: There doesn't seem to be any way to create a gist as an organization.
[2015/11/11 13:27:13] <Tobbi> https://gist.github.com/tobbi/c9fd5380aed73ce4bb82
[2015/11/11 13:27:18] <Tobbi> Wonder if you can access it and edit it.
[2015/11/11 13:28:22] <brmbrmcar> I can see it.
[2015/11/11 13:28:28] <Tobbi> Yes, but editing...
[2015/11/11 13:28:41] <Tobbi> actually, one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:28:46] <mt> I wonder if forking as organization would work
[2015/11/11 13:28:49] <brmbrmcar> Not editing.
[2015/11/11 13:28:58] <Karkus> Nope.
[2015/11/11 13:30:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: Damn.
[2015/11/11 13:30:31] <Tobbi> one moment, I'll find a way...
[2015/11/11 13:30:32] <brmbrmcar> I forked it.
[2015/11/11 13:30:33] <Tobbi> an etherpad, or something.
[2015/11/11 13:30:39] <brmbrmcar> And could edit.
[2015/11/11 13:30:48] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Won't help.
[2015/11/11 13:31:21] <brmbrmcar> I k-now.

[2015/11/11 13:33:41] <leyyin> Tobbi, your document is getting vandalized
[2015/11/11 13:33:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: By you?
[2015/11/11 13:34:03] <leyyin> I only added "Woohooo"
[2015/11/11 13:34:07] <Tobbi> gargh
[2015/11/11 13:34:11] <Tobbi> Let's try the wiki.
[2015/11/11 13:34:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: I added git shortlog v0.3.5..HEAD
[2015/11/11 13:34:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: I just wondered if it worked
[2015/11/11 13:34:35] <Tobbi> Aka, all commits since v0.3.5a
[2015/11/11 13:34:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, all the git commits
[2015/11/11 13:34:41] <Tobbi> oh!
[2015/11/11 13:34:41] <Karkus> Okay
[2015/11/11 13:34:43] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:34:47] <Tobbi> Wrong version.
[2015/11/11 13:35:04] <mt> can '^Merge pull request #.*' be excluded
[2015/11/11 13:35:20] <brmbrmcar> I think so.
[2015/11/11 13:35:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: You can stop it getting vandalised by just anyone can you not?
[2015/11/11 13:35:30] <Tobbi> I could
[2015/11/11 13:35:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe we should use the wiki, though.
[2015/11/11 13:35:40] <Tobbi> Now that I think about it.
[2015/11/11 13:35:47] <Karkus> I typed the newlines. But they're gone now
[2015/11/11 13:35:51] <Tobbi> Anyone here who does not have a wiki account?
[2015/11/11 13:36:03] <Karkus> Err... Me I think.
[2015/11/11 13:36:06] <Karkus> Let me check
[2015/11/11 13:36:27] <brmbrmcar> Done.
[2015/11/11 13:36:38] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: done what?
[2015/11/11 13:37:59] <brmbrmcar> Removed merge pull requests.

[2015/11/11 13:46:44] <mt> ok
[2015/11/11 13:47:23] <maths22> Also, once it is integrated into the offical repos, it should be triggered by a push
[2015/11/11 13:47:46] <Tobbi> maths22: How often will you trigger builds?
[2015/11/11 13:48:40] <maths22> Tobbi: once everything is working, there will be a set of pull requests (to tinygettext, squirrel, and supertux)
[2015/11/11 13:48:47] <maths22> After that, it will run on every commit
[2015/11/11 13:49:05] <maths22> it uses travis to handle the OS X and Linux builds
[2015/11/11 13:49:10] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 13:49:16] <maths22> AppVeyor is used to handle Windows
[2015/11/11 13:49:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: Mediawiki is great! It doesn't allow me to change a password for a user without access to a database.
[2015/11/11 13:49:42] <Tobbi> It only allows me to send a password reset email :D
[2015/11/11 13:50:10] <maths22> Also, I think I may change the upload name to include the commit hash (and only keep tags and the 10 most recent or something like that)
[2015/11/11 13:50:18] <maths22> I also need to fix the OSX icon
[2015/11/11 13:51:23] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: What's wrong with that?

[2015/11/11 13:52:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: PM
[2015/11/11 13:55:31] <leyyin> maths22, any documentation on how you did the builds on travis? :D
[2015/11/11 13:57:40] <Tobbi> Oh! AppVeyor is free for opensource apps...
[2015/11/11 13:57:41] <Tobbi> Great!
[2015/11/11 13:58:43] <brmbrmcar> Free!
[2015/11/11 13:59:03] <head8debian> Yay! Polipo! :p
[2015/11/11 13:59:26] <brmbrmcar> Celebrate!
[2015/11/11 13:59:32] <brmbrmcar> :)
[2015/11/11 13:59:47] <Tobbi> We could actually assemble a list of people who contributed and update the credits.
[2015/11/11 14:00:03] <Tobbi> If the number of contributions is > n where n is a positive integeer.
[2015/11/11 14:00:06] <Tobbi> *integer
[2015/11/11 14:00:22] <leyyin> 2^128
[2015/11/11 14:00:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Contributions is a fairly arbitrary unit, isn't it?
[2015/11/11 14:01:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yeah, indeed.
[2015/11/11 14:01:12] <maths22> leyyin: No documentation yet.  I can write some up once I have cleaned up my .travis.yml to be less ugly
[2015/11/11 14:01:56] <brmbrmcar> brmbrmcar Absolutely Nothing
[2015/11/11 14:02:07] <leyyin> ah, I found it, thanks maths22
[2015/11/11 14:03:39] <maths22> I also need to re-enable debug builds, etc, but only make these binaries for the release one
[2015/11/11 14:04:12] <maths22> Also, I think my branch only works in LLVM, so I need to fix that
[2015/11/11 14:04:24] <Tobbi> Hah! The overall number of my commits to SuperTux is 444
[2015/11/11 14:04:41] <leyyin> nice, I did not know about the apt addon in travis, TIL
[2015/11/11 14:04:58] <maths22> leyyin: it is relatively new
[2015/11/11 14:05:02] <Karkus> Mine should soon rise to 9
[2015/11/11 14:05:33] <maths22> also, SDL2 is only in the offical repos on 14.04, so I have it build on 14.04 so we don't need to build it ourselves
[2015/11/11 14:06:05] <Karkus> maths22 is it building automatically each day?
[2015/11/11 14:06:08] <Tobbi> maths22: Wait, travis allows you to build on 14.04 now?
[2015/11/11 14:06:27] <maths22> see https://github.com/maths22/supertux/blob/master/.travis.yml
[2015/11/11 14:06:32] <maths22> Karkus: not yet
[2015/11/11 14:06:51] <Tobbi> That is great!
[2015/11/11 14:06:57] <maths22> Once I have everything working and polished up, I will submit a pull request to the official repository, and this will hopefully get integrated in
[2015/11/11 14:07:01] <Tobbi> Sure, thanks!
[2015/11/11 14:07:15] <maths22> Karkus: then it will run with every push
[2015/11/11 14:07:17] <Tobbi> maths22: Does that add-on do deps caching? I assume no?
[2015/11/11 14:07:38] <maths22> Tobbi: no, but it runs pretty fast
[2015/11/11 14:07:42] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 14:07:53] <maths22> Builds (with packaging and uploads) take ~7 minutes
[2015/11/11 14:08:05] <Karkus> maths22: Every push!?
[2015/11/11 14:08:08] <maths22> https://travis-ci.org/maths22/supertux
[2015/11/11 14:08:13] <maths22> Karkus: yep!
[2015/11/11 14:08:22] <maths22> It just adds a step to the end of travis
[2015/11/11 14:08:53] <leyyin> and now you can do mac build too, hmm
[2015/11/11 14:08:56] <leyyin> windows too? :D
[2015/11/11 14:09:11] <maths22> leyyin: windows through AppVeyor
[2015/11/11 14:09:12] <Tobbi> Who cares about Windows? :P
[2015/11/11 14:09:32] <maths22> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maths22/supertux
[2015/11/11 14:09:33] <brmbrmcar> I don't.
[2015/11/11 14:09:39] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I was being ironic.
[2015/11/11 14:09:40] <brmbrmcar> Who cares about OSX?
[2015/11/11 14:09:46] <brmbrmcar> You.
[2015/11/11 14:09:51] <maths22> Tobbi: people who use Windows
[2015/11/11 14:09:55] <maths22> brmbrmcar: people who use OSX
[2015/11/11 14:09:56] <maths22> :)
[2015/11/11 14:10:00] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/11 14:10:11] <brmbrmcar> I use Linux
[2015/11/11 14:10:18] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I figured
[2015/11/11 14:10:48] <brmbrmcar> There is no good alternative apart from browser operating systems.
[2015/11/11 14:10:53] <Karkus> Who cares about Linux
[2015/11/11 14:10:57] <Karkus> :P
[2015/11/11 14:11:01] <Karkus> jk
[2015/11/11 14:11:28] <maths22> I also created a new dependency zip that includes the newest boot and VC14 boost libraries
[2015/11/11 14:11:39] <leyyin> maths22, so this is the only file you need for appveyor https://github.com/maths22/supertux/blob/master/appveyor.yml ?
[2015/11/11 14:11:52] <maths22> leyyin: yes
[2015/11/11 14:12:27] <maths22> It is nice and clean
[2015/11/11 14:12:31] <Tobbi> maths22: Could you package our final release as well? Or rather build a release build when we want to release?
[2015/11/11 14:12:54] <maths22> Tobbi: I will have it keep tagged builds (and not clean them up)
[2015/11/11 14:13:01] <maths22> It will also name tagged builds differently
[2015/11/11 14:13:03] <Tobbi> Great!
[2015/11/11 14:13:15] <maths22> (How that will work, I'm not yet sure, but I'll figure it out)
[2015/11/11 14:13:30] * leyyin takes notes for STK
[2015/11/11 14:13:33] <maths22> Tobbi: it also only packages the release one
[2015/11/11 14:13:58] <maths22> Also, can we assemble a list of everywhere we use the version number (or development state, like the main logo)
[2015/11/11 14:14:23] <Tobbi> yeah, we should do that.
[2015/11/11 14:15:54] <Tobbi> By the way, guys: http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Changelog_0.4.0_%28WIP%29
[2015/11/11 14:16:21] <Tobbi> Karkus, mt, head8debian, maths22, brmbrmcar ^^ if you want to contribute
[2015/11/11 14:17:00] <Tobbi> We would need to pick the most important changes and create releases notes from them.
[2015/11/11 14:17:16] <maths22> Do we know of anywhere besides CMakeLists.txt and data/images/objects/logo/logo.sprite
[2015/11/11 14:17:17] <Tobbi> I suggest we keep out the xmas stuff though, in order to keep them a surprise.
[2015/11/11 14:17:46] <Tobbi> CMakeLists.txt
[2015/11/11 14:17:53] <Tobbi> it uses patch levels etc.
[2015/11/11 14:17:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: So this isn't the actual file, just a draft of things which have been added?
[2015/11/11 14:18:05] <Karkus> To be developed into that.
[2015/11/11 14:18:11] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, exactly.
[2015/11/11 14:18:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: However, I intend to just move the file once it's ready and supertux is about to be released.
[2015/11/11 14:20:09] <maths22> Tobbi: for releases, we can actually use http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/
[2015/11/11 14:20:24] <maths22> Tobbi: they will then go straight into github
[2015/11/11 14:20:38] <maths22> I will mess with that feature later
[2015/11/11 14:21:20] <Tobbi> maths22: How would those be triggered? We just add tags?
[2015/11/11 14:21:46] <maths22> I believe so
[2015/11/11 14:22:04] <maths22> I'll investigate tonight
[2015/11/11 14:22:12] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/11 14:23:08] <leyyin> maths22, only the new containers are 14.04? not the old infrastructure
[2015/11/11 14:27:30] <leyyin> actually we can do windows cross compiling on linux, who needs windows anyways :P
[2015/11/11 14:27:41] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/11 14:27:47] <Tobbi> leyyin: well, I use it regularly...
[2015/11/11 14:29:18] <maths22> leyyin: i actually was going to cross-comple, but then I discovered appveyor
[2015/11/11 14:29:51] <leyyin> one problem I think it is, how you can upload the bundles securely to your file server
[2015/11/11 14:30:04] <leyyin> so that no one can hijack the upload, and upload something malicious
[2015/11/11 14:30:37] <maths22> the key will be changed and moved on an encrypted envvar

[2015/11/11 14:32:45] <maths22> it also doesnt populate them for pull requests, so a nalicious pull request cant hurt

[2015/11/11 14:56:18] <brmbrmcar> OK then.
[2015/11/11 14:59:15] <maths22> Tobbi: I also should add source tarballs (at least for tags)
[2015/11/11 14:59:24] <Tobbi> sounds good!
[2015/11/11 14:59:40] <maths22> Actually, github does that for us
[2015/11/11 14:59:42] <maths22> never mind that
[2015/11/11 15:02:33] <Tobbi> hmm.
[2015/11/11 15:05:03] <brmbrmcar> I looked through all the projects,
[2015/11/11 15:05:20] <brmbrmcar> How long has it been up for?

[2015/11/11 15:06:00] <maths22> s/notification/notifier/
[2015/11/11 15:06:00] <red_bot> maths22 meant: "Tobbi: is the notifier not in the github repo settings?"
[2015/11/11 15:06:23] <Tobbi> maths22: No, it's a webhook (called Notifico)
[2015/11/11 15:06:56] <maths22> OK.  I know GitHub has a decent one built in
[2015/11/11 15:07:06] <maths22> You could probably kill Notifico and enable it if you wanted to
[2015/11/11 15:07:17] <Tobbi> Yeah, or create my own Notifico account.

[2015/11/11 15:47:49] <brmbrmcar> Support what?
[2015/11/11 15:48:07] <brmbrmcar> Oh XP.
[2015/11/11 15:48:26] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/11 15:48:28] <brmbrmcar> Why?
[2015/11/11 15:48:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes.
[2015/11/11 15:48:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: And they have not made any moves to stop supporting it.
[2015/11/11 15:48:54] <Tobbi> Which is good. At least they did something right
[2015/11/11 15:50:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: :p
[2015/11/11 15:50:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: No one should be supporting xp...

[2015/11/11 15:50:25] <brmbrmcar> Do thay support Windows 1.0?
[2015/11/11 15:50:33] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: haha, no.
[2015/11/11 15:51:00] <head8debian> XP is just so crusty...
[2015/11/11 15:51:08] <brmbrmcar> Do they support Chrome OS?
[2015/11/11 15:51:16] <head8debian> I think debian Jessie is old. :p
[2015/11/11 15:51:27] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: I don't know. I doubt it.
[2015/11/11 15:52:03] <brmbrmcar> Soon all Android apps will work, so that means Firefox. :D
[2015/11/11 15:52:58] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Or chrome will merge with android. :)

[2015/11/11 17:03:02] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/11 17:05:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: Can we have multiplayer (on a single keyboard) as part of supertux 3?
[2015/11/11 17:05:38] <Tobbi> Sounds good. File an issue.
[2015/11/11 17:05:43] <Tobbi> We'd also need sprites...
[2015/11/11 17:05:51] <Tobbi> I mean: We need a different player sprite.
[2015/11/11 17:05:55] <Tobbi> and animations and everything.
[2015/11/11 17:05:56] <Karkus> ik
[2015/11/11 17:06:11] <Karkus> But I guess for now we could recolor tux in gimp
[2015/11/11 17:06:19] <Karkus> takes a couple seconds
[2015/11/11 17:06:50] <Tobbi> Possibly, sure.
[2015/11/11 17:07:04] <Tobbi> but since this is for SuperTux 3 anyway...
[2015/11/11 17:07:14] <Tobbi> Karkus: It'd mean split screen, right?
[2015/11/11 17:07:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: TBC
[2015/11/11 17:07:26] <Karkus> To Be Considered
[2015/11/11 17:07:31] <Karkus> In this sense
[2015/11/11 17:07:33] <Tobbi> sounds fun.
[2015/11/11 17:07:34] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 17:08:06] <Karkus> In the Mario games (I know I talk about these a lot) it's not split screen.
[2015/11/11 17:08:25] <Tobbi> I finally (!!) managed to update the add-on index.
[2015/11/11 17:08:27] <Karkus> Split screen would be infinity times harder to implement
[2015/11/11 17:08:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Index?
[2015/11/11 17:08:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: But if one player is faster than the other?
[2015/11/11 17:08:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: I added head8debian's worldmap changes for rubberduck
[2015/11/11 17:09:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: Then the slower gets crushed on the screen
[2015/11/11 17:09:12] <Tobbi> uhm...okay?
[2015/11/11 17:09:13] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 17:09:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Great! Can you now close the issue?
[2015/11/11 17:09:18] <Tobbi> Oh, of course.
[2015/11/11 17:09:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Have you really never played those games
[2015/11/11 17:09:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: To be honest, no! :D
[2015/11/11 17:09:40] <Karkus> New Super Mario Wii etc.

[2015/11/11 17:10:45] <Karkus> Tobbi: We could actually have many players if we used the game controllers
[2015/11/11 17:10:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: Do you own a game controller? :D
[2015/11/11 17:11:04] <Tobbi> Because I don't and thus can't test support for that.
[2015/11/11 17:11:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: I... don't know...
[2015/11/11 17:11:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: What *is* a game controller which is compatible?
[2015/11/11 17:11:38] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/11 17:12:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's an SDL thing isn't it?
[2015/11/11 17:12:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: indeed.
[2015/11/11 17:13:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have also been thinking about a website where people can submit their add-ons. We review them and we can auto-push them to the game.
[2015/11/11 17:13:53] <Tobbi> That would be fun.
[2015/11/11 17:13:56] <Tobbi> No more editing nfo files.

[2015/11/11 17:14:05] <Karkus> https://youtu.be/pipMu0HXiU0?t=50s
[2015/11/11 17:14:09] <Karkus> That one maybe
[2015/11/11 17:15:37] <Tobbi> Interesting.
[2015/11/11 17:15:44] <Tobbi> So, maybe not that hard to implement.
[2015/11/11 17:19:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: Playing with other people over the internet could be fun :D
[2015/11/11 17:19:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: It would, yes
[2015/11/11 17:20:34] <Karkus> I think we could have a huge leader board with top levels created by people all over the place
[2015/11/11 17:20:50] <Karkus> And then you can play them. Multiplayer, too
[2015/11/11 17:21:03] <Karkus> Compete for time or secrets etc.
[2015/11/11 17:21:04] <Tobbi> That would be great.
[2015/11/11 17:21:08] <Tobbi> But also alot of work.
[2015/11/11 17:21:14] <Tobbi> But maybe we'll get people to contribute after 0.4.0
[2015/11/11 17:21:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: No kidding
[2015/11/11 17:21:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: But that's a good thing for a roadmap.
[2015/11/11 17:22:40] <Karkus> Well, top priority after 0.4.0, for me at least, is flexlay. The problem is I think the code is too annoying. I'm not saying I could do better, but I think I could.
[2015/11/11 17:23:15] <Karkus> It's all a bit disorganised

[2015/11/11 17:33:44] <Tobbi> Some of the German translations are so...bad...
[2015/11/11 17:34:07] <Tobbi> "Take your pick" -> <translates as if someone would take an actual "pick">
[2015/11/11 17:34:15] <Tobbi> You know...ice pick for example.
[2015/11/11 17:36:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: tooth pick

[2015/11/12 10:22:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: We had a power outage all morning...
[2015/11/12 10:22:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: Including yourself?
[2015/11/12 10:23:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes?
[2015/11/12 10:24:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: No electric = cannot milk cows...
[2015/11/12 10:24:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: I know, cows don't work... Cows are a direct result of electricity...
[2015/11/12 10:24:51] <Tobbi> Actually, first the electricity, then the cow.
[2015/11/12 10:24:59] <Tobbi> Perfect symbioses.
[2015/11/12 10:25:03] <Tobbi> *symbiosis

[2015/11/12 10:25:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: We could milk them by hand, but its hard to do 100 cows by hand. :)
[2015/11/12 10:25:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: Have you ever sold forged harddisks and cholesterol?
[2015/11/12 10:25:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, no?
[2015/11/12 10:26:05] <Tobbi> alright.
[2015/11/12 10:26:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: And we have roughly 100,000 turkeys being fed around us also, which cannot be fed without electricity.
[2015/11/12 10:26:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: ever tried?
[2015/11/12 10:26:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: I notice that when you put a turkey in a hot stove (= electricity) it tasts better afterwards.
[2015/11/12 10:27:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: I'd rather cook it over a gas stove. :D
[2015/11/12 10:27:17] <head8debian> Much more eficient.
[2015/11/12 10:27:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Gas hasn't been invented yet around here.
[2015/11/12 10:28:18] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/12 10:29:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, basically, whenever we want to cook something, we have people who rotate sticks in order for hay to catch fire.
[2015/11/12 10:29:29] <Tobbi> or something.
[2015/11/12 10:29:41] <Tobbi> Because, we don't know how to deal with electricity.
[2015/11/12 10:29:46] <Tobbi> Sometimes it's there, sometimes it isn't.
[2015/11/12 10:29:55] <Tobbi> Sometimes it's too strong, sometimes it's too low.
[2015/11/12 10:30:10] <Tobbi> Sometimes it's an amoeba.
[2015/11/12 10:31:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm.
[2015/11/12 10:31:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: Us americans find it quite reliable. :D
[2015/11/12 10:32:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: says the one with a power outage.
[2015/11/12 10:32:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its back on now...
[2015/11/12 10:32:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: So twice a year it goes out for a couple hours.
[2015/11/12 10:33:12] <head8debian> It seems to be just with our electricity line.
[2015/11/12 10:33:25] <head8debian> the neighbors never lose electricity.
[2015/11/12 10:33:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Have you ever tried to stack cows on top of each other? In theory that should give you more energy, since there's more potential energy.

[2015/11/12 10:41:11] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 10:48:34] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/12 11:00:47] <mt> Tobbi: it was me who set up notifico, but when there's no option in the "Webhooks & services" section I can't change anything (w/o modifying notifico and then running it on my own server)
[2015/11/12 11:01:03] <mt> I can disable it, but...
[2015/11/12 11:01:18] <Tobbi> mt: hmm...okay, so there's really nothing we can do, for now...
[2015/11/12 11:01:45] <Tobbi> We could ask github to give us fine-grained control.
[2015/11/12 11:01:50] <Tobbi> but that's asking too much, I assume.
[2015/11/12 11:02:19] <mt> Yeah
[2015/11/12 11:03:00] <mt> what wouldn't be asking too much of github would be include all label changes in, say the last minute, in one event
[2015/11/12 11:03:15] <mt> but that would - in the end - also require updating notifico's code

[2015/11/12 11:42:35] <head8debian> Its expensive...
[2015/11/12 11:42:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: Wow, you're growing up to be an ordinary person.
[2015/11/12 11:42:37] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/12 11:43:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, whats that mean?
[2015/11/12 11:43:13] <Tobbi> head8debian: What it means.
[2015/11/12 11:43:17] <brmbrmcar> I hate paying for music.
[2015/11/12 11:44:01] <head8debian> I figured i'd better support support the bands i listen to. Keeps them in buisiness. :)
[2015/11/12 11:45:27] <brmbrmcar> I never buy music.
[2015/11/12 11:45:47] <brmbrmcar> Why would I :P
[2015/11/12 11:46:56] <mt> In Germany, torrenting music is like paying 500 â¬ for a CD
[2015/11/12 11:47:11] <head8debian> mt: Why?
[2015/11/12 11:47:14] <mt> heck, even more
[2015/11/12 11:47:19] <head8debian> Bandwidth that expensive? :p
[2015/11/12 11:47:33] <head8debian> I don't torrent it. Or use any odd websites...
[2015/11/12 11:47:38] <mt> because you'll get an Abmahnung (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abmahnung)
[2015/11/12 11:48:07] <head8debian> Ouch.
[2015/11/12 11:48:16] <brmbrmcar> If I want music, I download a high quality version from Youtube.
[2015/11/12 11:48:26] <brmbrmcar> Completely illegal, but who cares.
[2015/11/12 11:48:37] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Same here... ;)

[2015/11/12 11:48:55] <mt> Sadly, high quality music from youtube or even bought from itunes/google play/amazon isn't really high quality
[2015/11/12 11:48:55] <head8debian> Our church half hinges on youtube...
[2015/11/12 11:49:12] <head8debian> mt: I know what you mean.

[2015/11/12 11:49:44] <head8debian> percent of the profit*
[2015/11/12 11:49:52] <mt> dunno
[2015/11/12 11:49:56] <leyyin> I buy music from my local dealer :D
[2015/11/12 11:49:57] <leyyin> it's free
[2015/11/12 11:50:15] <head8debian> I usually listen to the radio...
[2015/11/12 11:50:24] <leyyin> head8debian, you drive a lot?
[2015/11/12 11:50:25] <brmbrmcar> But these days, quality of CDs is actually getting worse, as most people write to MP3 when making it.
[2015/11/12 11:51:03] <mt> I still know of studios using magnet tape for recording and mastering
[2015/11/12 11:51:09] <head8debian> leyyin: A decent amount. Not much though.
[2015/11/12 11:51:31] <leyyin> radio listening is only when driving :P
[2015/11/12 11:51:41] <head8debian> mt: Alof of studios i know keep it digital as much as possible.
[2015/11/12 11:51:57] <head8debian> Record high quality as digital.
[2015/11/12 11:52:00] <leyyin> if it's lossless, then it's fine
[2015/11/12 11:52:51] <head8debian> As long as it doesn't sound awfull im fine with it. :p
[2015/11/12 11:53:09] <brmbrmcar> Why do people listen to the radio when driving?
[2015/11/12 11:53:29] <brmbrmcar> I listen to all the bumps and creaks!
[2015/11/12 11:53:34] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/11/12 11:53:56] <brmbrmcar> Way better. :D

[2015/11/12 12:02:37] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Vehicle? Or motor?
[2015/11/12 12:02:44] <brmbrmcar> Vehichle.
[2015/11/12 12:02:44] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: A V10.
[2015/11/12 12:02:51] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Ford Excursion.
[2015/11/12 12:03:05] <brmbrmcar> How old?
[2015/11/12 12:03:12] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: 13 years.
[2015/11/12 12:03:17] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: quack it. :p
[2015/11/12 12:03:59] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: The other vehicle is a 2001 Dodge Ram. 24 valve. 6 cylinder Diesel.
[2015/11/12 12:04:21] <head8debian> Actually, its an 8 cylinder.
[2015/11/12 12:04:25] <head8debian> Cummins. :D
[2015/11/12 12:04:59] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/12 12:05:02] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: quack it = look it up on duckduckgo...
[2015/11/12 12:05:08] <brmbrmcar> Both bad for cras tests.
[2015/11/12 12:05:22] <brmbrmcar> That's what I wanted to know.
[2015/11/12 12:05:22] <head8debian> nope, its a 6 valve.
[2015/11/12 12:05:28] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: FOr what?
[2015/11/12 12:05:36] <brmbrmcar> Crashing.
[2015/11/12 12:05:39] <brmbrmcar> Safety.
[2015/11/12 12:05:50] <head8debian> We don't have emissions test and other junk up here... thankfully.
[2015/11/12 12:06:10] <brmbrmcar> Where are you?
[2015/11/12 12:06:13] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Uhm, these vehicles are much safer in a crash than any car.
[2015/11/12 12:06:22] <head8debian> Northern USA?
[2015/11/12 12:06:36] <brmbrmcar> Not into something like a tree.
[2015/11/12 12:06:56] <mt> sadly you don't have emissions tests
[2015/11/12 12:07:01] <brmbrmcar> And also Safe small is better than Dangerous big.
[2015/11/12 12:07:40] <head8debian> brmbrmcar:I dissagree. Do you want to meet a semi with a car or with a truck? Do you want to meet a truck with a car or another truck?
[2015/11/12 12:07:52] <head8debian> Without all the emissions crud Diesels could get 20mpg.
[2015/11/12 12:08:02] <head8debian> Currently they get about 11mpg.
[2015/11/12 12:08:04] <head8debian> mt: o_O
[2015/11/12 12:08:08] <brmbrmcar> Watch the
[2015/11/12 12:08:54] <head8debian> mt: If you show me some sort of emissions stuff that actually works on a diesel engine, then maybei  will change my mind.
[2015/11/12 12:09:01] <head8debian> I understand the CAT converter on a car.

[2015/11/12 12:10:12] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: And up here where we get so much snow you don't want to have a car. You will get stuck before you can blink on half these roads.
[2015/11/12 12:10:51] <head8debian> Also, explain to my why its considered better for the enviroment to have the engine burn twice as much fuel for the same result vs half the fuel for the same result.
[2015/11/12 12:11:40] <brmbrmcar> Anything can go through snow if you are brave.
[2015/11/12 12:12:01] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: LOL. ;)

[2015/11/12 12:14:23] <head8debian> I hate all the electronics in these new cars. Sure they are great while they work, but they are so expensive when they break.
[2015/11/12 12:15:09] <head8debian> Every farmer and person ive talked to that know how this stuff actually works have nothing good to say about it.
[2015/11/12 12:15:18] <head8debian> And neither do i...
[2015/11/12 12:15:45] <brmbrmcar> I want one with an electromagnet to repel other vehichles when they are too close.

[2015/11/12 12:17:04] <brmbrmcar> Easy.
[2015/11/12 12:17:16] <brmbrmcar> More tourque.
[2015/11/12 12:17:30] <head8debian> Which is why you have a truck. :)
[2015/11/12 12:18:36] <brmbrmcar> Trucks never have as much torque as sport vehichles.

[2015/11/12 12:25:45] <brmbrmcar> Are they pets?
[2015/11/12 12:25:56] <head8debian> Tobbi should buy a goat to trim his lawn and eat his trash...
[2015/11/12 12:26:04] <head8debian> They like old fruit better though.

[2015/11/12 12:31:33] <brmbrmcar> Do the goats have restraints?
[2015/11/12 12:31:49] <head8debian> Wheat has never been genetically modified. :D
[2015/11/12 12:32:04] <head8debian> Im no GMO nut. We do what we have to to feed everyone.
[2015/11/12 12:32:12] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Pastures? Yes.
[2015/11/12 12:32:21] <brmbrmcar> Not that.
[2015/11/12 12:32:41] <brmbrmcar> Like safety belts for the back of the truck.
[2015/11/12 12:33:06] <brmbrmcar> THe big one.
[2015/11/12 12:33:45] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Uhm, we don't move them unless we need to. When they need to be moved they get a trailer that is open inside and they lay down while we are moving.
[2015/11/12 12:34:03] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/12 12:34:47] <head8debian> Animals have very quiet and comfortable and lazy lives. :)
[2015/11/12 12:34:57] <Tobbi> Depends on the animal.
[2015/11/12 12:35:02] <head8debian> True.
[2015/11/12 12:35:07] <head8debian> Most domestic ones do.
[2015/11/12 12:35:14] <head8debian> Dairy animals mostly..
[2015/11/12 12:35:31] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do you know Kobe beef? Best beef there is.
[2015/11/12 12:35:38] <head8debian> Eat, sleep, poop, get milked, thats their life. :D

[2015/11/12 12:38:17] <brmbrmcar> I hate meat.
[2015/11/12 12:38:20] <Tobbi> about that subject.
[2015/11/12 12:38:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes, america fast paced...sadly.
[2015/11/12 12:38:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: What a coincidence. :p
[2015/11/12 12:38:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why coincidence?
[2015/11/12 12:39:04] <head8debian> You know nothing, yet he knows everything, yet you can call it by a name. ;)
[2015/11/12 12:39:09] <head8debian> nm...
[2015/11/12 12:39:27] <head8debian> Our family is much slower paced IMHO.
[2015/11/12 12:39:52] <brmbrmcar> Accelerator! Accelerator!
[2015/11/12 12:39:58] <head8debian> Its nice. :)
[2015/11/12 12:40:31] @ Quit: xet7: Quit: Leaving
[2015/11/12 12:42:23] <brmbrmcar> What is?
[2015/11/12 12:46:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzCf2RJHNSw
[2015/11/12 12:48:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: Is your police really that...strict?
[2015/11/12 12:52:21] <brmbrmcar> POLICE!!!
[2015/11/12 12:54:23] <brmbrmcar> Oh my god.
[2015/11/12 12:54:29] <brmbrmcar> That is bad.
[2015/11/12 12:55:27] @ alket joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/12 12:57:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, what did the motercyclist do in the last part?
[2015/11/12 12:58:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: I really don't know.
[2015/11/12 12:58:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Usually its about like the first half, maybe slightly more strict. We don't allow drag racing, and it is dangerous, especially on our roads.
[2015/11/12 12:58:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, I have to admit that I think it might be an unfair comparison.
[2015/11/12 12:58:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: He had to have done something pretty bad to have been treated like that.
[2015/11/12 12:58:46] <Tobbi> Probablz.
[2015/11/12 12:58:51] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2015/11/12 12:59:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, I got stopped by the police once. For going too fast. I was in quite a hurry...
[2015/11/12 12:59:21] <head8debian> Yes. We have accedentally once also.
[2015/11/12 12:59:26] <head8debian> And a couple flat tires.
[2015/11/12 12:59:48] <Tobbi> I needed to get dressed properly...and we had a choral concert... So, of course I was going 60 in a 30 speed limit zone.
[2015/11/12 12:59:50] <head8debian> Police are not mean over here, but im sure they can seem ruder than they are.
[2015/11/12 13:00:00] <head8debian> Yeah... ouch.
[2015/11/12 13:00:09] <Tobbi> So, I explained to the officer that I was in quite a hurry, and fortunately he didn't give me a ticket.
[2015/11/12 13:00:25] <head8debian> Ok, thats a easy let off. We get a warning. ;)
[2015/11/12 13:00:31] <head8debian> Then a ticket.
[2015/11/12 13:00:40] <brmbrmcar> I am scared of the US!
[2015/11/12 13:00:50] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Me too! :D
[2015/11/12 13:00:51] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/12 13:01:27] <brmbrmcar> All the death penalties!
[2015/11/12 13:01:34] <head8debian> But our police are not bad. If everyone else is going 75 and your going 77 you wont get pulled over...
[2015/11/12 13:01:37] <Tobbi> Oh, yeah, that...
[2015/11/12 13:01:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: In kph, please.
[2015/11/12 13:01:48] <brmbrmcar> I am glad I don't live there.
[2015/11/12 13:01:55] <brmbrmcar> No offence.
[2015/11/12 13:02:11] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Oh brother. There have not been many death offences in the US. Too few IMHO.
[2015/11/12 13:02:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm...
[2015/11/12 13:02:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't know KMph...
[2015/11/12 13:02:30] <Tobbi> okay...
[2015/11/12 13:02:51] <brmbrmcar> I do.
[2015/11/12 13:03:04] <head8debian> We feed some of these criminals their whole life through our taxes and they sit in jail and watch TV all day...
[2015/11/12 13:03:13] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/11/12 13:03:13] <brmbrmcar> 123 km/h
[2015/11/12 13:03:15] <Tobbi> "One of the shortest words in the German dictionary is RindfleischetikettierungsÃ¼berwachungsaufgabenÃ¼bertragungsgesetz, for example, which loosely means âNoâ."
[2015/11/12 13:03:18] <head8debian> Our jails are quite crowded atm.
[2015/11/12 13:03:29] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, are you for or against the death penalty?
[2015/11/12 13:03:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: Can you explain it better to me?
[2015/11/12 13:04:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: Explain what?
[2015/11/12 13:04:17] <head8debian> The death penalty. ;)
[2015/11/12 13:04:26] <head8debian> I don't hear much about it.
[2015/11/12 13:04:33] <head8debian> nm.
[2015/11/12 13:05:02] <head8debian> This is getting awkward...
[2015/11/12 13:05:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: Uhm, you're the one living in the US?
[2015/11/12 13:05:18] * head8debian also wonders why he has headphones on and is not listening to anything.
[2015/11/12 13:05:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do they have the death penalty in Michigan?
[2015/11/12 13:06:02] <leyyin> also Europe is the main cause a lot of states are abolishing the death penalty
[2015/11/12 13:06:19] <leyyin> because only Europe produces the drugs and we refuse to sell them anymore
[2015/11/12 13:06:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im not sure if death is the correct way to go, but i don't like it that we have so many people sitting in jail.
[2015/11/12 13:06:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: IIRC we don't.
[2015/11/12 13:06:29] <Tobbi> leyyin: Which is good!
[2015/11/12 13:06:33] <leyyin> Tobbi, agree
[2015/11/12 13:06:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: however, Texas apparently still gets their drugs from somewhere else...
[2015/11/12 13:06:55] <leyyin> Tobbi, ilegally
[2015/11/12 13:07:01] <Tobbi> Probably, yeah.
[2015/11/12 13:07:10] <leyyin> only Europe sells those drugs legally
[2015/11/12 13:07:14] <leyyin> "sold" :D
[2015/11/12 13:07:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: I believe Hospira even stopped producing Pentobarbital...
[2015/11/12 13:07:19] <head8debian> Of course illegally! They will get them weather you allow it or not. Its human nature.
[2015/11/12 13:07:24] <Tobbi> Or what it's called.
[2015/11/12 13:07:36] <head8debian> Sadly...
[2015/11/12 13:07:47] <leyyin> also, texas ;)
[2015/11/12 13:07:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's a government ffs. They have to abide by the law...
[2015/11/12 13:07:49] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/12 13:07:52] <leyyin> the hill billy country
[2015/11/12 13:07:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: I wouldn't want to live there.
[2015/11/12 13:08:23] <leyyin> me neither, you should avoid southern states in murica anyway
[2015/11/12 13:08:36] <leyyin> Florida especially :D
[2015/11/12 13:08:39] <Tobbi> leyyin: Still, I regularly search the news about death penalty. Morbid curiosity...
[2015/11/12 13:08:40] <head8debian> The Bible also says "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth", so i have always belived that that mean 'a life for a life'. But i do belive self defence is one exception.
[2015/11/12 13:08:59] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh, c'mon, please. That principle is what Texas goes by...
[2015/11/12 13:09:00] <leyyin> head8debian, are you jew?
[2015/11/12 13:09:13] <leyyin> only jews apply that law
[2015/11/12 13:09:16] <leyyin> christians do not
[2015/11/12 13:09:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: Society evolves.
[2015/11/12 13:09:21] <head8debian> They are trying to allow marajuanna(or how ever its written) up here.
[2015/11/12 13:09:25] <leyyin> because Jesus told us to love
[2015/11/12 13:09:34] <Tobbi> Marihuana...
[2015/11/12 13:09:43] <head8debian> leyyin: *real* christians do, "christians" don't.
[2015/11/12 13:09:49] <leyyin> "An Eye for an Eye Will Make the Whole World Blind"
[2015/11/12 13:09:55] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/12 13:10:19] <Tobbi> We're at that topic again (religion)
[2015/11/12 13:10:28] <leyyin> Tobbi, yes, you heathen ;)
[2015/11/12 13:10:34] <head8debian> I don't know why anyone considers themselves a Christian when they don't even trust the Bible.
[2015/11/12 13:10:40] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/12 13:10:46] <leyyin> head8debian, are you mad that Starbucks changed their cup?
[2015/11/12 13:10:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: I am not a heathen. I am baptized and confirmed.
[2015/11/12 13:11:17] <head8debian> leyyin: They did? I dont keep track of stuff like that.
[2015/11/12 13:11:24] <leyyin> Tobbi, obvious trying to get under your skin joke, captain obvious ;)
[2015/11/12 13:11:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Catholic? Baby baptised?

[2015/11/12 13:11:46] <head8debian> NO YOUTUBE VIDEOS!
[2015/11/12 13:11:47] <Tobbi> Who cares about religion anyway.
[2015/11/12 13:11:52] <leyyin> head8debian, why not?
[2015/11/12 13:12:06] <leyyin> I worked at youtube for 3 months ;)
[2015/11/12 13:12:17] @ head8debian left channel #supertux ("ttyl...")
[2015/11/12 13:12:29] <leyyin> he left because of me
[2015/11/12 13:12:31] <Tobbi> what?
[2015/11/12 13:12:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: I thought it was because of me.
[2015/11/12 13:12:36] <leyyin> ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED
[2015/11/12 13:12:46] <leyyin> Tobbi, do you want to fight over it?
[2015/11/12 13:12:50] * leyyin punches Tobbi 
[2015/11/12 13:12:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, got better stuff to do.
[2015/11/12 13:13:03] <Tobbi> I don't need violence to fight you, leyyin.
[2015/11/12 13:13:16] <Tobbi> Violence is bad anyway.
[2015/11/12 13:13:17] <Tobbi> I got my chainsaw always with me.
[2015/11/12 13:13:25] * leyyin runs
[2015/11/12 13:13:27] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:14:10] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, the problem with religion is that it's supposed to be a moral guidance, somewhat, but it often claims to be so much more.
[2015/11/12 13:14:28] <red_bot> /me chases tobbi with his chainsaw...
[2015/11/12 13:14:30] <Tobbi> And people who are really religious don't get that it's all open to interpretation and can be seen more or less strict.
[2015/11/12 13:14:35] <Tobbi> red_bot: Stop!
[2015/11/12 13:14:55] <red_bot> Tobbi: What? :p
[2015/11/12 13:15:16] <Tobbi> red_bot: If you want to be like brm brm car and pretend to ragequit only to read the logs...

[2015/11/12 13:17:21] <head8debian> I wanted to. :D
[2015/11/12 13:17:33] <leyyin> and why no youtube videos?

[2015/11/12 13:21:05] <head8debian> And take it as a compliment...

[2015/11/12 13:37:00] <brmbrmcar> Which is why diarrhoea has to be spelt diarrhea.
[2015/11/12 13:37:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do you like English?
[2015/11/12 13:37:18] <brmbrmcar> Which I hate.
[2015/11/12 13:37:30] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have grown to like it. It's really elegant.
[2015/11/12 13:37:35] <Tobbi> In a way.
[2015/11/12 13:37:37] <Karkus> Elegant?
[2015/11/12 13:37:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: The language flow is different...
[2015/11/12 13:37:51] <Karkus> It breaks all the rules all the time!?
[2015/11/12 13:38:00] <Tobbi> Karkus: But it sounds so...flowy...
[2015/11/12 13:38:01] <Karkus> German follows rules
[2015/11/12 13:38:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: In Britain everyone thinks german people sound angry
[2015/11/12 13:38:41] <brmbrmcar> I hate when they teach spelling rules for English that aren't ever right.
[2015/11/12 13:38:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: We don't only sound angry, we are angry. When we're not angry, we're not in any way conscious.
[2015/11/12 13:39:00] <brmbrmcar> I don't think German people sound amgry.
[2015/11/12 13:39:08] <Karkus> "'I' before 'E' except after 'C'"
[2015/11/12 13:39:10] <brmbrmcar> s/amgry/angry/
[2015/11/12 13:39:10] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "I don't think German people sound angry."
[2015/11/12 13:39:34] <brmbrmcar> I before E except after blank is better.
[2015/11/12 13:39:51] * head8debian rolls his eyes...

[2015/11/12 13:40:54] <brmbrmcar> Schoolis horrible.IRC school is not.
[2015/11/12 13:42:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: "I before E except after C? Is that an official rule? What about "riechen" then?
[2015/11/12 13:42:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's an english rule
[2015/11/12 13:42:25] <Tobbi> ah!
[2015/11/12 13:42:25] <Karkus> Reich?
[2015/11/12 13:42:35] <Tobbi> No, not rich.... riechen = to smell.
[2015/11/12 13:42:39] <head8debian> Yes, its a actual english rule. Helps with writing.
[2015/11/12 13:42:51] <Karkus> Weight? Height?

[2015/11/12 13:43:22] <Karkus> Food Poisoning = Lebensmittelvergiftung
[2015/11/12 13:43:25] <head8debian> How can you remember how to spell that?
[2015/11/12 13:43:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: Very good!
[2015/11/12 13:43:33] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:43:39] <Karkus> Transport links = Vehrkersverbindungen
[2015/11/12 13:43:45] <Karkus> If I spelled that right?
[2015/11/12 13:43:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: the "h" is at the wrong place.
[2015/11/12 13:43:53] <Karkus> Verkehr?
[2015/11/12 13:43:57] <Tobbi> Yes!
[2015/11/12 13:44:16] <Karkus> I haven't used either of those, ever
[2015/11/12 13:44:27] <Karkus> Hmmm, 'use'
[2015/11/12 13:44:29] <Tobbi> What a shame.
[2015/11/12 13:44:31] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:44:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I play Scrabble with my English lecturer at college every 2 weeks.
[2015/11/12 13:44:51] <brmbrmcar> brmbrmauto
[2015/11/12 13:44:52] <Tobbi> It's nice.
[2015/11/12 13:44:59] <Karkus> head8debian: If you can say it, you can spell it.
[2015/11/12 13:45:00] <head8debian> o-O
[2015/11/12 13:45:17] <head8debian> I haven no clue where to even begin pronouncing it.
[2015/11/12 13:45:36] <Karkus> Fer ker sfer bind ung en?
[2015/11/12 13:45:39] <brmbrmcar> Fer ker
[2015/11/12 13:45:43] <head8debian> I have enough issues pronouncing that oddball car dealer down the road's name.
[2015/11/12 13:45:48] <brmbrmcar> Karkus!

[2015/11/12 13:47:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: Wait, I showed you this before, right?
[2015/11/12 13:48:00] <head8debian> Karkus: Not sean it? ;p
[2015/11/12 13:48:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yepp
[2015/11/12 13:48:18] <head8debian> I still don't understand why sean is pronounced Shawn.
[2015/11/12 13:48:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, now something you might not have seen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaJtjJNrWf0

[2015/11/12 13:48:54] <head8debian> Karkus: How is that pronounced?
[2015/11/12 13:49:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: And it wasn't me who showed you that, right?
[2015/11/12 13:49:03] <Karkus> Sheh vawn
[2015/11/12 13:49:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Not this time, no

[2015/11/12 13:50:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't mind. Once I was told a story by a friend about something they did with their friend. Who happened to be me. -.-
[2015/11/12 13:50:09] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:51:11] <maths22> I'm working now on setting up OpenBuildService for the linux builds

[2015/11/12 13:53:04] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/12 13:53:48] <brmbrmcar> English is hard!
[2015/11/12 13:54:44] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So it's not your native language?
[2015/11/12 13:56:24] <brmbrmcar> It is.
[2015/11/12 13:57:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is Backpfeifengesicht a word?

[2015/11/12 13:58:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: You should rather not use it.
[2015/11/12 13:58:34] <Karkus> subtle is another stupid English spelling
[2015/11/12 13:58:35] <brmbrmcar> Longest word.

[2015/11/12 13:59:11] <brmbrmcar> But I would if talking about it.
[2015/11/12 13:59:37] <brmbrmcar> I know nothing about Titin.
[2015/11/12 14:00:06] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: its a protein, thats all i know.
[2015/11/12 14:00:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: What are the German views on the Second World War? Is it rude to talk about or make fun of it?
[2015/11/12 14:00:46] <Karkus> Specifically Germany
[2015/11/12 14:00:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's a really good question...I believe it's kind of a taboo subject here, still...
[2015/11/12 14:01:19] <Tobbi> We don't make fun of it.
[2015/11/12 14:01:34] <head8debian> We don't either.
[2015/11/12 14:01:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't mean in a disrespectful way.
[2015/11/12 14:01:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: Problem is: Because of the refugee crisis, the right-wing parties get more attration.
[2015/11/12 14:01:38] <head8debian> I don't think.
[2015/11/12 14:01:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's perfectly alright.
[2015/11/12 14:02:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, what about this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDeG4S-mJts

[2015/11/12 14:02:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, you got me. I find that funny.
[2015/11/12 14:02:21] <brmbrmcar> Only because of a few idiots who started a war.
[2015/11/12 14:02:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Hitler parodies are something different.
[2015/11/12 14:02:44] <Karkus> Tobbi: You've seen it already then? :P
[2015/11/12 14:02:52] <Tobbi> Karkus:  yeah ! :D

[2015/11/12 14:13:23] <Karkus> It's super easy to learn, takes a couple months to become fluent in it. (I've heard)
[2015/11/12 14:13:32] <Karkus> Very similar to Latin

[2015/11/12 14:16:21] <Karkus> leyyin: I guess that not many people are hipsters then.

[2015/11/12 14:17:49] <Tobbi> leyyin: Nerds learn Klingon.
[2015/11/12 14:18:38] <brmbrmcar> brmbrmcar language is like Linux. You get distrobutions of all major languages.
[2015/11/12 14:20:42] <brmbrmcar> Who wants to learn?

[2015/11/12 17:25:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not really...
[2015/11/12 17:25:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: But it's a religious song?
[2015/11/12 17:25:40] <Tobbi> or not?
[2015/11/12 17:26:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's one of the few songs I really like.
[2015/11/12 17:27:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not really my style... but part of our christmas playlist this year. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeaHAQklVVc&list=PLzGCPH8UWJzInF-XeNlDUZGvFjr0SWobt&index=3
[2015/11/12 17:27:32] <head8debian> I don't agree with all the lyrics in all of those songs, but meh. :p

[2015/11/12 19:01:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about you take over... :P Make language add-ons work after I tried unsuccessfully.
[2015/11/12 19:03:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did we actually ever decide on a proper release date?
[2015/11/12 19:09:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im thinking the day before christmas...
[2015/11/12 19:09:15] <head8debian> If thats possible.
[2015/11/12 19:09:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: But then people won't have that much time to see the new x-mas stuff.
[2015/11/12 19:09:31] <Tobbi> Actually, let me have a look.
[2015/11/12 19:10:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: True...
[2015/11/12 19:10:49] <head8debian> Tobbi: How about the 20th?
[2015/11/12 19:10:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: That could work.
[2015/11/12 19:11:00] <Tobbi> But, let's see...
[2015/11/12 19:11:37] <head8debian> Im afk. :)
[2015/11/12 19:12:21] <Tobbi> head8debian: SuperTux 0.3.1 was released on the 20th.
[2015/11/12 19:12:25] <Tobbi> So, maybe we should do that.
[2015/11/12 19:13:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Does this computer even look worth $45? http://www.asus.com/Notebooks/Eee_PC_1001PX_Seashell/
[2015/11/12 19:13:30] <head8debian> Used. 2gb ram.
[2015/11/12 19:14:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: I have no idea.
[2015/11/12 19:15:25] <head8debian> Hmm... A local school is gettign rid of a bunch of them.
[2015/11/12 19:29:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: But Windows 10 is such a hog that i don't think they would fare well on them.
[2015/11/12 19:29:39] <Tobbi> heh
[2015/11/12 19:30:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Google chrome is a hog as of recently also...
[2015/11/12 19:31:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: I see.
[2015/11/12 19:33:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: You haven't noticed? :)
[2015/11/12 19:33:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't use google chrome as much.
[2015/11/12 19:34:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot open more than 10 tabs now in chrome without filling up my ram and causing swap to kick in.
[2015/11/12 19:36:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Am i boring you?
[2015/11/12 19:36:17] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do you want me to be honest?
[2015/11/12 19:38:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes!
[2015/11/12 19:38:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Actually, as much as you write, you could become a wikipedia editor.
[2015/11/12 19:39:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: I've considered it. :-) If i got paid i might consider it.
[2015/11/12 19:39:33] <head8debian> further*
[2015/11/12 19:39:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why would you want to get paid?
[2015/11/12 19:40:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Wikipedia is a voluntary site. No one earns anything.
[2015/11/12 19:40:07] <Tobbi> Except Jimmy Wales.
[2015/11/12 19:40:10] <head8debian> I know. :-) It was a joke.
[2015/11/12 19:40:33] <head8debian> But for as much as we both type we could have huge websites with tons of info...
[2015/11/12 19:40:43] <head8debian> And this is the best ive gotten... :p

[2015/11/12 19:46:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't think i will buy any of those computers...
[2015/11/12 19:46:27] <head8debian> I honestly don't feel right trying to resell anything with less than 4gb of ram.
[2015/11/12 19:46:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Good thinking. I would suggest a Rechenschiebevorrichtung.
[2015/11/12 19:47:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Huh?
[2015/11/12 19:47:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: calculation shifting appliance.
[2015/11/12 19:47:34] <head8debian> _O

[2015/11/12 19:48:58] <Tobbi> Stop that.
[2015/11/12 19:49:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: LOL. Sorry. :-) Or is he becoming like me? :)
[2015/11/12 19:49:50] <Tobbi> head8debian: Or you two are the same person?

[2015/11/12 19:51:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Definately not.
[2015/11/12 19:51:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: good.
[2015/11/12 19:51:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: I should work on our wiki...
[2015/11/12 19:52:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, you should work on language add-on support.
[2015/11/12 19:52:19] <Tobbi> For some reason it won't work properly unless you restart...
[2015/11/12 19:52:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot code. We have been over this.
[2015/11/12 19:52:29] <head8debian> Uhm, at least it work?
[2015/11/12 19:52:31] <head8debian> works*
[2015/11/12 19:52:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yeah, it works...
[2015/11/12 19:52:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: You should really learn how to code.
[2015/11/12 19:54:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: I will learn a little when my Arduino gets here.
[2015/11/12 19:54:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, at least that's Python. Is it on its way?
[2015/11/12 19:54:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot even motivate myself to learn to program, how can i motivate myself to learn to code?
[2015/11/12 19:54:24] <Tobbi> Wait, is it python?
[2015/11/12 19:54:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Aren't those two things the same thing?
[2015/11/12 19:54:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: No. Its a hack up of C and C++
[2015/11/12 19:54:43] <Tobbi> Even better!
[2015/11/12 19:54:46] <head8debian> program a website**
[2015/11/12 19:55:02] <head8debian> Except my arduino was supposed to be here last week...
[2015/11/12 19:55:08] <head8debian> And still hasn't appeared.
[2015/11/12 19:55:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do you hate giving presentations as much as I do?
[2015/11/12 19:55:33] <head8debian> When i give one i will let you know. :-)
[2015/11/12 19:55:54] <Tobbi> heh...
[2015/11/12 19:56:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im getting more comfortable with speaking in front of people...
[2015/11/12 19:56:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: Well, actually it was worse when I was younger.
[2015/11/12 19:56:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: I speek in front of kids at church all the time, so how much harder can can grown ups be? :D
[2015/11/12 19:57:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: Kids are easier to integrate into a dishwasher than grownups. So there's that.
[2015/11/12 19:57:43] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/12 19:58:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: Have you ever tried to integrate kids into a dishwasher?
[2015/11/12 20:00:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: No.
[2015/11/12 20:00:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: Do you have some Cat5 that i can have?
[2015/11/12 20:00:43] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, I wouldn't be able to care about a cat.
[2015/11/12 20:00:44] <head8debian> I need a short piece.

[2015/11/13 06:42:50] <Tobbi> maths22, Also, the windows builds are missing SSLEAY32.dll and LIBEAY32.dll

[2015/11/13 08:39:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: Your IRC client did some smamming yesterday...
[2015/11/13 08:39:39] <head8debian> spamming*
[2015/11/13 08:39:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Really?
[2015/11/13 08:39:46] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/13 08:39:55] <leyyin> Tobbi, you should kick yourself
[2015/11/13 08:40:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't see it in the logs...
[2015/11/13 08:40:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: You left here thankfully.
[2015/11/13 08:40:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: try the #stk logs.
[2015/11/13 08:40:32] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/13 08:41:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: It was even more excessive in #secretchronicles... so i put a temporary ban on you in there.
[2015/11/13 08:41:07] <head8debian> Must have had internet issues.
[2015/11/13 08:41:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yeah, I should probably use a bouncer...
[2015/11/13 08:41:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: Why?
[2015/11/13 08:42:24] <Tobbi> I thought I had shutdown my computer.
[2015/11/13 08:42:47] <Tobbi> Well..
[2015/11/13 08:47:27] <Tobbi> head8debian: SuperTux 0.3.5a is now in homebrew-games
[2015/11/13 08:48:18] <leyyin> who uses mac anyways :P
[2015/11/13 08:48:34] <Tobbi> leyyin: Who uses Chromebooks, anyways? :P
[2015/11/13 08:48:42] <leyyin> not me ;)
[2015/11/13 08:48:57] <leyyin> I did not use one for almost 2 months
[2015/11/13 08:48:57] <Tobbi> leyyin: Maybe if I knew anything about computers, I would probably buy a different one.
[2015/11/13 08:53:57] <Tobbi> Okay, that is getting old, I have to admit.
[2015/11/13 08:55:09] * head8debian nods...
[2015/11/13 08:55:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: You don't need to buy a diferent one, you need to install Arch on your current one. :D
[2015/11/13 08:55:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: I'd rather not.
[2015/11/13 08:57:52] <leyyin> head8debian, everyone knows that arch is for peasants and gentoo is for gods ;)
[2015/11/13 08:58:42] <head8debian> Ok, debian? :D
[2015/11/13 08:58:53] <leyyin> debian is for plebs :P
[2015/11/13 08:59:04] <head8debian> Tobbi + ubuntu. Fits perfect. :p
[2015/11/13 08:59:11] <Tobbi> I tried ubuntu.
[2015/11/13 08:59:18] <head8debian> leyyin + gentoo, fits perfect.
[2015/11/13 08:59:18] <Tobbi> Didn't like it.
[2015/11/13 08:59:30] <head8debian> head8debian + gentoo. Pushing it too far.
[2015/11/13 08:59:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't blame you.
[2015/11/13 09:00:11] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its a broken OS IMHO.
[2015/11/13 09:09:32] <leyyin> os means bone in Romanian :P
[2015/11/13 09:09:41] <leyyin> get another os Tobbi
[2015/11/13 09:09:43] <leyyin> good boy
[2015/11/13 09:09:53] <Tobbi> leyyin: os is bone in Latin as well.
[2015/11/13 09:10:05] <leyyin> well yeah, we are latin people ;)

[2015/11/13 09:10:34] <leyyin> and fino-ugric people to the west :P
[2015/11/13 09:10:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: I don't know anything about languags :D
[2015/11/13 09:11:04] <Tobbi> *languages
[2015/11/13 09:11:17] <Tobbi> haha.
[2015/11/13 09:11:18] <Tobbi> Sorry.
[2015/11/13 09:11:54] <leyyin> well at least you know your language group, right?
[2015/11/13 09:12:41] <Tobbi> leyyin: Germanic? :P

[2015/11/13 09:14:35] <Tobbi> Despite me not knowing anything.
[2015/11/13 09:14:39] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/13 09:14:42] <Tobbi> maths22: Thanks.
[2015/11/13 09:14:47] <maths22> Also, I haven't yet integrated your recent changes into my branch, hence the wrong version number
[2015/11/13 09:15:02] <maths22> (It hasn't been rebuilt recently)
[2015/11/13 09:15:11] <Tobbi> Right!
[2015/11/13 09:15:14] <Tobbi> No problem.
[2015/11/13 09:15:46] <Tobbi> leyyin: I got a task for you: Find out why language packs only work properly after a restart...
[2015/11/13 09:16:02] <Tobbi> for SuperTux that is.
[2015/11/13 09:16:39] <leyyin> busy for STK :P
[2015/11/13 09:16:44] <leyyin> hiker is gonna kill me
[2015/11/13 09:16:56] <leyyin> Tobbi, what is your threat?
[2015/11/13 09:17:13] <Tobbi> leyyin: I can kill you as well? As you know, I got a chainsaw.
[2015/11/13 09:17:20] <Tobbi> Actually, make that two.
[2015/11/13 09:17:24] <leyyin> hiker has connections ;)
[2015/11/13 09:18:00] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/11/13 09:35:43] <maths22> By the way, what Linux distros should we be building for?
[2015/11/13 09:35:50] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/13 09:39:45] <Tobbi> hmm. let me check.
[2015/11/13 09:43:21] <head8debian> Uhm, every OS we can? :D
[2015/11/13 09:43:35] <head8debian> distro*
[2015/11/13 09:44:40] <maths22> Setting up each one takes a non-zero amount of effort
[2015/11/13 09:45:18] <maths22> Therefore, I want to figure out which ones we want so I can focus that effort on the more important distros/versions first
[2015/11/13 09:46:31] <head8debian> maths22: Good idea.
[2015/11/13 09:49:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: What do you think?
[2015/11/13 09:49:47] <Tobbi> think?
[2015/11/13 09:49:52] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/11/13 09:50:09] <Tobbi> I mean: Target most popular distros and be good with it.
[2015/11/13 09:50:45] <maths22> You can see which ones are currently working here: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:maths22:SuperTux/supertux2
[2015/11/13 09:54:33] <Tobbi> maths22: So, target those that work. The other ones, well, if you can, compile the missing deps yourself on those distros and use that.

[2015/11/13 10:49:17] <head8debian> And dirty results, if you know what i mean.

[2015/11/13 10:58:04] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: I don't think my goats have wifi way over there, or can type so well.
[2015/11/13 10:59:56] <brmbrmcar> They use superfast Goat internet.
[2015/11/13 11:00:03] <brmbrmcar> Faster than 5g.
[2015/11/13 11:00:24] <brmbrmcar> And can type at over 400 WPM.
[2015/11/13 11:00:41] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/13 11:02:29] <mt> maths22: well I'd suggest to get the build working on opensuse 13.2 and ubuntu 15.10 (what's the problem with the latter - libsdl2-*dev exists in the official package archives for wily and even xenial)
[2015/11/13 11:03:10] <mt> possibly also centos 7, but I'm not sure anybody's using that on a desktop system
[2015/11/13 11:03:16] <brmbrmcar> Goat internet costs 9999000$ a month.
[2015/11/13 11:05:08] <head8debian> Nobody i know is using centOS as a desktop OS.
[2015/11/13 11:05:20] <mt> if you need an Arch Linux PKGBUILD I can provide you one
[2015/11/13 11:05:25] <brmbrmcar> What is centOS?
[2015/11/13 11:05:32] <head8debian> maths22: Not opensuse 43 or whatever the latest release is?
[2015/11/13 11:05:37] <head8debian> mt: ^^
[2015/11/13 11:05:51] <head8debian> I can also provide one.
[2015/11/13 11:07:04] <mt> brmbrmcar: it's CentOS and it's a binary-compatible rebuild of the RedHat Enterprise Linux sources without proprietary RedHat logos etc.
[2015/11/13 11:08:52] <mt> head8debian: openSUSE Tumbleweed is the latest release for the build service, I'm unsure what this OS 42/43/whatever is supposed to be

[2015/11/13 11:56:07] <mt> Also, I'd sugggest you to use such a dynamic versioning using git commit number since first commit and git commit hash for the other packages
[2015/11/13 11:56:25] <mt> Since OBS provides a usable repository for package manager
[2015/11/13 11:56:27] <mt> s
[2015/11/13 11:57:34] <maths22> mt: I will fix the version numbers
[2015/11/13 11:57:42] <maths22> They will end up like git describe ones
[2015/11/13 11:57:57] <maths22> (latest tag + hash)
[2015/11/13 12:00:24] <mt> Yeah but be careful with the PKGBUILD because that won't really work (0.4.0.ae4ab9b will be considered a lower version than 0.4.0.bb0e3e1 in pacman)
[2015/11/13 12:00:50] <mt> I don't know how other systems will handle that
[2015/11/13 12:01:38] <maths22> this is why it is actually latest tag + num commits + hash
[2015/11/13 12:01:55] <maths22> i.e 1.0.4-14-g2414721
[2015/11/13 12:02:00] <mt> why do you write tag + hash then
[2015/11/13 12:02:11] <maths22> Because I wasn't thinking
[2015/11/13 12:02:47] <mt> and if you're already saying 1.0.4-14-g24...: pacman doesn't allow dashes in pkgver
[2015/11/13 12:04:31] <brmbrmcar> Nome of the buil;ds work for me.

[2015/11/13 12:11:54] <mt> Tobbi: is that even allowed under GPL/CC-BY-SA? Aren't you only allowed to charge the cost of distribution (which I'd say for savannah is none)?

[2015/11/13 12:12:25] <Tobbi> That's a good question. I thought it was...

[2015/11/13 12:12:37] <Tobbi> SA...share alike.
[2015/11/13 12:12:50] <Tobbi> Question is GPL
[2015/11/13 12:13:03] <Tobbi> I don't know.
[2015/11/13 12:13:45] <mt> well as seen in the picture it uses our images
[2015/11/13 12:14:21] <mt> so, ask a lawyer and then submit a DMCA takedown notice?

[2015/11/13 12:16:38] <head8debian> sue, sue!
[2015/11/13 12:16:39] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/13 12:16:42] <maths22> Since these are art assets, and not code, the application of the GPL to them is less than obvious
[2015/11/13 12:16:48] <maths22> Thus, a good question for a lawyer

[2015/11/13 12:18:10] <Tobbi> mt: The image are share-alike. So if he shares only those (allows them to be downloaded)...
[2015/11/13 12:18:32] <Tobbi> right?
[2015/11/13 12:18:50] <Tobbi> I don't really want to pay for a lawyer :D not for this project.
[2015/11/13 12:19:15] <mt> I think EFF or some other open source organization provides lawyers for projects
[2015/11/13 12:19:26] <maths22> Due to the fact that images are not code, not linked in code, etc, sharing the assets probably is enough for him
[2015/11/13 12:20:49] <Tobbi> I hope he attributes us...
[2015/11/13 12:20:53] <Tobbi> He has to...
[2015/11/13 12:21:43] <mt> "Although ReTux re-uses the art assets of SuperTux, no code from SuperTux is used in ReTux."
[2015/11/13 12:22:04] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/13 12:22:21] <Tobbi> Okay, I rather meant in-game as well.
[2015/11/13 12:22:42] <maths22> I believe it owuld simply need to be in the game distribution
[2015/11/13 12:22:58] <maths22> That is, in some LICENCE/LEGAL/CREDITS file distributed with the game
[2015/11/13 12:23:12] <Tobbi> Unfortunately we cannot check.
[2015/11/13 12:23:23] <Tobbi> Since there are no binary distributions available,
[2015/11/13 12:24:20] <maths22> If there is no binary distribution, then it is hard to violate the terms associated with a binary distrubtion
[2015/11/13 12:24:23] <Tobbi> Are any of the items under a CC-NC license?
[2015/11/13 12:25:06] <maths22> (That is, he can't be doing something wrong with a thing that he is has not created/shared)
[2015/11/13 12:25:43] <maths22> everything appears to be GPL or CC-BY-SA
[2015/11/13 12:26:06] <mt> Well, the art *has* to be attributed in any case, be it in the code or in a binary distribution
[2015/11/13 12:26:24] <mt> even if it'd just be CC-BY

[2015/11/13 12:37:43] <Tobbi> Does this guy indulge in getting on other people's nerves?

[2015/11/13 12:41:22] <Tobbi> Not sure.
[2015/11/13 12:42:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: I can give you a bouncer if you would really like.
[2015/11/13 12:42:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: I'd rather go for a proper one...
[2015/11/13 12:42:29] <Tobbi> Or I host it on my raspberry pi.
[2015/11/13 12:42:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/13 12:42:44] <head8debian> It is propper.
[2015/11/13 12:43:34] <Karkus> Regarding that freegamedev post, what if he's using the code from supertux too?
[2015/11/13 12:43:40] <Karkus> How could we ever know?
[2015/11/13 12:43:55] <Tobbi> We can't.
[2015/11/13 12:44:23] <Tobbi> That's actually a problem.
[2015/11/13 12:44:38] <Karkus> With the GPL in general
[2015/11/13 12:44:50] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/13 12:44:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: http://retux.nongnu.org/index.html this uses SuperTux images
[2015/11/13 12:44:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: I wonder if brmbrmcar is spying on us through the logs... they will refresh in 3 mins...

[2015/11/13 12:45:01] <Karkus> Speak of the devil
[2015/11/13 12:45:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: He PMed me and asked me why I kicked him.
[2015/11/13 12:45:07] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/13 12:45:13] <Tobbi> He told me his message wasn't coming through.
[2015/11/13 12:45:29] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Don't Ping people repeadedly.
[2015/11/13 12:45:30] <Tobbi> Not sure if his client was acting up or whether he was just getting on our nerves.
[2015/11/13 12:45:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: I think latter... my client never acts up...
[2015/11/13 12:45:50] <Tobbi> I still assume it's the latter but we can never know.
[2015/11/13 12:45:52] <Tobbi> hah
[2015/11/13 12:46:02] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: If there appears to be a problem, try reconnecting rather than resending the message
[2015/11/13 12:46:06] <head8debian> Ive never have had one act up either.
[2015/11/13 12:46:17] <brmbrmcar> I didn't know I sent it.
[2015/11/13 12:46:32] <brmbrmcar> After a while I just restarted.
[2015/11/13 12:46:35] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: mt told you to stop, what else could he have been referring to?
[2015/11/13 12:46:45] <brmbrmcar> I didn't see it.
[2015/11/13 12:46:53] <Karkus> head8debian: My experience with bad internet tells me that sometimes I send a message and see it in the client but it hasn't sent.
[2015/11/13 12:47:00] <Karkus> This could be the other way rounf
[2015/11/13 12:47:24] <maths22> I'm guessing the client stopped showing new messages
[2015/11/13 12:47:34] <maths22> Including those he sent
[2015/11/13 12:47:37] <Karkus> maths22: I'm guessing that too
[2015/11/13 12:48:00] <head8debian> Karkus: irssi tells me if its having trouble connecting to the server.
[2015/11/13 12:48:17] <Karkus> head8debian: After how long?
[2015/11/13 12:48:40] <Karkus> Hexchat takes a while to notice
[2015/11/13 12:49:15] <head8debian> Karkus: Usually a few seconds. Then it tells you when the last time it was able to contact the server.
[2015/11/13 12:49:24] <maths22> It sounds like a bug, not a network error
[2015/11/13 12:49:34] <brmbrmcar> The [#supertux] disappeared.
[2015/11/13 12:49:41] <Karkus> It doesn't matter what caused it.
[2015/11/13 12:49:44] <maths22> Given that he had to restart to fix it
[2015/11/13 12:49:54] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: What IRC client do you use now?
[2015/11/13 12:50:37] <brmbrmcar> irssi
[2015/11/13 12:51:19] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/13 12:51:41] <Karkus> HexChat is better :P
[2015/11/13 12:51:56] <head8debian> Karkus: :-)
[2015/11/13 12:52:03] <head8debian> User glitch... :p
[2015/11/13 12:52:17] <Karkus> head8debian: ?
[2015/11/13 12:52:42] <maths22> Irssi is certainly better-you can leave it running on a server 24/7
[2015/11/13 12:53:02] <maths22> I can't do that with hexchat
[2015/11/13 12:53:08] <Karkus> maths22: Why would you?
[2015/11/13 12:53:11] <Karkus> It's a gui
[2015/11/13 12:53:11] <brmbrmcar> And anyway, when I say the word "test", surely you must mean something has happened?
[2015/11/13 12:53:36] <maths22> I wouldn't
[2015/11/13 12:53:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: Not sure if you can help it, but: Would you know/be able to find out how to make tinygettext effectively re-read the dictionaries (currently, language add-ons still don't work properly until you restart)
[2015/11/13 12:54:15] <maths22> My point was that irssi is clearly superior because it is cli- based /s
[2015/11/13 12:54:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'll have a look. Doubt I'll be of any help D:
[2015/11/13 12:54:38] <Tobbi> No problem.
[2015/11/13 12:55:14] <Karkus> maths22: Superior for some things, but sometimes you just want a pretty GUI
[2015/11/13 12:55:16] <head8debian> Karkus: Irssi is running on a headless server for me.
[2015/11/13 12:55:29] <head8debian> The last couple days the server hasn't had the best uptime. :p
[2015/11/13 12:55:30] <Karkus> head8debian: Which is a good way to use it
[2015/11/13 12:55:42] <mt> weechat <3
[2015/11/13 12:55:43] <head8debian> Yes, thats why im "always" in IRC.
[2015/11/13 12:55:51] <mt> also command line + support for IRCv3
[2015/11/13 12:55:53] <Karkus> head8debian: I figured
[2015/11/13 12:56:29] <Karkus> head8debian: I did try irssi but I didn't like it, just my opinion :) Not the kind of thing I needed
[2015/11/13 12:56:30] <brmbrmcar> irssijust looks awesome
[2015/11/13 12:56:55] <maths22> I actually have irssi set up as a proxy too, so I can use native irc clients (on my phone) in the same session
[2015/11/13 12:56:58] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: No, it looks like it's cli based
[2015/11/13 12:57:32] <head8debian> maths22: I don't really care. Irssi does the job well, and according to you is not "broken".
[2015/11/13 12:57:53] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: What?
[2015/11/13 12:57:56] <head8debian> maths22: I just ssh into my server.
[2015/11/13 12:58:03] <head8debian> From my phone. :)

[2015/11/13 12:58:16] <maths22> Some days I do
[2015/11/13 12:58:16] <Karkus> Command Line... Interface?
[2015/11/13 12:58:19] <head8debian> I don't like phone IRC though.
[2015/11/13 12:58:29] * head8debian laughs...
[2015/11/13 12:58:55] <maths22> I mostly got tired of losing spell check and swype
[2015/11/13 12:58:56] <head8debian> Now we are sharing screenshots? :p
[2015/11/13 12:59:06] <head8debian> maths22: Ah.
[2015/11/13 12:59:39] <head8debian> Irssi + guake = awesome. :D
[2015/11/13 12:59:52] <maths22> mt: which os?
[2015/11/13 12:59:56] <head8debian> I have my irc client at the cue of a couple hotkeys.
[2015/11/13 13:00:11] <brmbrmcar> How did you get it lokoing like that?
[2015/11/13 13:00:17] <head8debian> That reminds me, i should change my desktop background.
[2015/11/13 13:00:28] <head8debian> Look like he has a 4k screen or something...
[2015/11/13 13:00:31] <mt> Arch Linux, bspwm, GTK and QT with the Arc theme + breeze icons
[2015/11/13 13:00:50] <mt> Terminal is gnome-terminal but I'm also using xfce4-terminal
[2015/11/13 13:01:17] <mt> tmux for as terminal multiplexer, weechat for IRC
[2015/11/13 13:01:57] <mt> and no 4K, it's a full HD 27" display
[2015/11/13 13:02:11] <head8debian> Oh, 2k then. :)
[2015/11/13 13:02:25] <head8debian> Yeah... thats huge.
[2015/11/13 13:02:29] <brmbrmcar> 32K
[2015/11/13 13:02:42] <brmbrmcar> 4K is horrible!
[2015/11/13 13:03:05] <brmbrmcar> 4K is just giant blocks of colour!
[2015/11/13 13:03:14] <head8debian> maths22: Why bspwm?
[2015/11/13 13:03:27] <head8debian> maths22: Arg. Sorry.
[2015/11/13 13:03:33] <head8debian> mt: Why bspwm?
[2015/11/13 13:03:53] <mt> because it like its configuration; it supports gaps etc.
[2015/11/13 13:04:05] <head8debian> Ah.

[2015/11/13 14:37:34] <mt> why not?
[2015/11/13 14:38:30] <brmbrmcar> Because it would be chaos.
[2015/11/13 14:39:09] <brmbrmcar> It is a game-wide thing.
[2015/11/13 14:40:26] <datahead8888> Does Super Tux only use one collision box/circle to detect both enemy hits and if Tux is standing on the ground, or does it use a second collision detection and/or line casting?  If it only uses one collision, how does it tell if he collided on top of an object?
[2015/11/13 14:45:09] <datahead8888> I needed to clean up my collision detection in another game and was curious about this in Super Tux, since Math Nerd referenced it when I asked him.
[2015/11/13 14:49:58] <Karkus> datahead8888: I don't understand your question, what's wrong with one collision box?
[2015/11/13 14:54:05] <datahead8888> I never said anything was wrong with it :)
[2015/11/13 14:54:11] <datahead8888> I just asked how Super Tux does it.
[2015/11/13 14:54:59] <datahead8888> In my own game, I have one circle collider plus, essentially, four smaller circle colliders on top, bottom, left, and right.  It is a mess, I think.
[2015/11/13 14:55:02] <Karkus> datahead8888: Then I don't understand your question :P
[2015/11/13 14:55:35] <brmbrmcar> Collision!
[2015/11/13 14:55:55] <datahead8888> Does Super Tux detect both Super Tux running into enemies and standing on the ground using only one collision box?  Is more than one collision box used?  Does it also use line casting for part of this?
[2015/11/13 14:56:20] <brmbrmcar> I have no idea.
[2015/11/13 14:56:28] <brmbrmcar> I think just the one.
[2015/11/13 14:56:41] <datahead8888> Okay, I got that impression from what Math Nerd said
[2015/11/13 14:57:09] <datahead8888> I'd be curious to know how it tells if Tux is standing on top of a collided object or is to the side, though
[2015/11/13 14:57:37] <Karkus> datahead8888: All I know is, we use collision boxes, and we have problems sometimes
[2015/11/13 14:57:52] <datahead8888> Yes, especially with slopes I've heard
[2015/11/13 14:57:53] <Karkus> datahead8888: Boxes are different
[2015/11/13 14:58:04] <Karkus> datahead8888: Correct
[2015/11/13 14:58:24] <brmbrmcar> I don't know, maybe with decimals and gradient stuff to tell it which side of box.
[2015/11/13 14:58:42] <datahead8888> Gradients?
[2015/11/13 14:58:50] <brmbrmcar> Yeah
[2015/11/13 14:59:08] <datahead8888> Some people have suggested I add line casting to a collision box in my game; is this what you mean?
[2015/11/13 14:59:30] <brmbrmcar> Idon't know.
[2015/11/13 14:59:40] <brmbrmcar> What is your game?
[2015/11/13 15:01:09] <datahead8888> It is a Unity 2D platformer/shooter
[2015/11/13 15:01:21] <datahead8888> I was just curious how Super Tux handled things for reference
[2015/11/13 15:02:05] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/13 15:02:21] <brmbrmcar> Ino nothing about collision based stuff.
[2015/11/13 15:02:38] <leyyin> maths22, `sudo: required` is the opposite of `sudo: false` ?
[2015/11/13 15:03:57] <maths22> leyyin: nope
[2015/11/13 15:04:07] <maths22> The opposite is just not including `sudo: false`
[2015/11/13 15:04:27] <leyyin> the opposite as sudo:falses always run on containters
[2015/11/13 15:04:35] <leyyin> sudo:required never run on containers
[2015/11/13 15:04:53] <leyyin> so they seem to be ;)
[2015/11/13 15:05:07] <maths22> What is wrong wtih containers if you don't need sudo?
[2015/11/13 15:05:29] <leyyin> I do not know
[2015/11/13 15:05:53] <maths22> Were you just asking for your curiosity?
[2015/11/13 15:06:17] <brmbrmcar> Run this command but allow it to do anything it wants to this computer!
[2015/11/13 15:06:17] <leyyin> well yes
[2015/11/13 15:06:26] <leyyin> I am testing something out for the stk-editor
[2015/11/13 15:06:43] <brmbrmcar> The stk-editor doesn't work!
[2015/11/13 15:06:59] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, how so?
[2015/11/13 15:07:05] <leyyin> open issue
[2015/11/13 15:07:41] <brmbrmcar> I selected the directory with the files in and nothing happened!
[2015/11/13 15:08:03] <leyyin> did you read the manual :D
[2015/11/13 15:08:03] <leyyin> ?
[2015/11/13 15:08:16] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/13 15:08:28] <brmbrmcar> And the first step failed!
[2015/11/13 15:08:46] <brmbrmcar> Does it neeed to be 0.9.x?
[2015/11/13 15:08:54] <Karkus> datahead8888: A Unity game is a bit difficult to compare to SuperTux
[2015/11/13 15:09:01] <leyyin> I will have to check it out later
[2015/11/13 15:09:12] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/13 15:09:53] <datahead8888> Karkus, yes, but some principles do not change
[2015/11/13 15:10:56] <brmbrmcar> sudo apt-get install unity
[2015/11/13 15:11:55] <maths22> brmbrmcar: glad to know you appreciate the Ubuntu desktop interface
[2015/11/13 15:12:14] <maths22> (That is what that command would actually install on an Ubuntu machine)
[2015/11/13 15:12:54] <brmbrmcar> I don't like the tracking.
[2015/11/13 15:13:23] <brmbrmcar> And all the social media stuff.
[2015/11/13 15:13:44] <leyyin> maths22, also, is there no cleaner way to install mac packages? checking with an if "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" = "osx" is ugly :D
[2015/11/13 15:13:51] <leyyin> in before_install
[2015/11/13 15:14:13] <maths22> leyyin: at this point in time, no
[2015/11/13 15:14:26] <maths22> Hopefully, travis adds support like they have for apt as a plugin
[2015/11/13 15:14:31] <leyyin> yes :D
[2015/11/13 15:14:33] <leyyin> brew:
[2015/11/13 15:14:34] <leyyin> like apt
[2015/11/13 15:14:43] <maths22> That would be nice
[2015/11/13 15:14:57] <maths22> That said, SuperTux previously had it as a manual apt-get command
[2015/11/13 15:15:03] <maths22> because the apt plugin is pretty new
[2015/11/13 15:15:17] <brmbrmcar> sudo apt-get install supertux
[2015/11/13 15:15:27] <brmbrmcar> apt-cache search supertux
[2015/11/13 15:16:24] <Karkus> datahead8888: Yeah, of course. If you do line collision for each line in the rect, then you'll get the side. Or there are other fun ways.
[2015/11/13 15:17:02] <brmbrmcar> Crash!
[2015/11/13 15:19:13] <datahead8888> brmbrmcar, crash?
[2015/11/13 15:19:39] <brmbrmcar> datahead888: CRASH!
[2015/11/13 15:19:43] <leyyin> the containers suck :D, only 2 threads, really
[2015/11/13 15:19:51] <brmbrmcar> FRontal! Side! Rear!
[2015/11/13 15:19:54] <maths22> By the way, with these automated builds, I'm thinking that we need to change the way we label dev builds
[2015/11/13 15:19:56] <brmbrmcar> Rollover!
[2015/11/13 15:20:29] <maths22> Basically, tools tend to mark dev builds as coming x amount after the previous release, not coming before the next one
[2015/11/13 15:20:30] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: What are you on about?
[2015/11/13 15:20:54] <brmbrmcar> Crashes!
[2015/11/13 15:21:03] <brmbrmcar> brm brm car crashes!
[2015/11/13 15:21:27] <maths22> Therefore, we are currently on v0.3.5-385-gf69dc07 (by Git's numbering)
[2015/11/13 15:22:34] <maths22> This also makes package numbering work
[2015/11/13 15:22:59] <maths22> Currently, using our labeling scheme, we are on 0.4.0-git-3ecf...
[2015/11/13 15:23:17] <maths22> That either is not well ordered or comes after 0.4.0, which is actually the final release
[2015/11/13 15:23:50] <datahead8888> I think someone likes cars
[2015/11/13 15:24:32] <maths22> datahead8888: I'm with you on that one
[2015/11/13 15:24:43] <brmbrmcar> brm brm cars!
[2015/11/13 15:25:36] <leyyin> the trusty machines are even slower :D
[2015/11/13 15:25:43] <datahead8888> brmbrmcar, you ought to make a car crashing gmae
[2015/11/13 15:25:44] <datahead8888> ***game
[2015/11/13 15:25:52] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/13 15:25:58] <datahead8888> Seriously
[2015/11/13 15:26:00] <datahead8888> :)
[2015/11/13 15:26:02] <brmbrmcar> With airbags.
[2015/11/13 15:26:11] <brmbrmcar> I will try...
[2015/11/13 15:26:18] <maths22> leyyin: building supertuxkart?
[2015/11/13 15:26:18] <datahead8888> You could get points for better crashes and set up safety devices in the car
[2015/11/13 15:26:30] <leyyin> maths22, no, the stk-editor
[2015/11/13 15:26:33] <datahead8888> Be sure to use a good physics engine
[2015/11/13 15:26:54] <brmbrmcar> It would have to be realistic.
[2015/11/13 15:27:04] <datahead8888> Yeah
[2015/11/13 15:27:05] <maths22> leyyin: how long is it taking?
[2015/11/13 15:27:15] <datahead8888> You could also send cars into compressors in your game
[2015/11/13 15:27:34] <datahead8888> Or drop them from airplanes
[2015/11/13 15:27:35] <leyyin> about 2 minutes on 12.04
[2015/11/13 15:27:40] <leyyin> about 4 on 14.04
[2015/11/13 15:28:48] <brmbrmcar> Front end damage cm = speed in kmh divided by overlap
[2015/11/13 15:29:27] <maths22> leyyin: still less long than I had to wait when setting up the supertux builds
[2015/11/13 15:29:44] <brmbrmcar> After 40cm half damage amounts per 40cm
[2015/11/13 15:29:49] <leyyin> on the old machines with 32 threads, under 1 minute
[2015/11/13 15:29:49] <maths22> And I think I made about 50 commits (and waited through at least 30 of them)
[2015/11/13 15:29:59] <maths22> leyyin: what machines?
[2015/11/13 15:30:10] <leyyin> the old infrastructure of travis
[2015/11/13 15:30:34] <leyyin> well I will squash the commits to be only one ;)
[2015/11/13 15:30:36] <maths22> leyyin: infrastructure they don't have anymore, or the non-container one?
[2015/11/13 15:30:43] <maths22> leyyin: I will do the same
[2015/11/13 15:30:50] <leyyin> the non-container one
[2015/11/13 15:30:51] <maths22> If git doesn't hate me too much
[2015/11/13 15:31:06] <maths22> leyyin: That's odd.  Those are supposed to have 1.5 cores each (I believe)
[2015/11/13 15:31:13] <maths22> 32 threads should not have run that well
[2015/11/13 15:31:31] <leyyin> well it does not run well for STK but for the editor :D
[2015/11/13 15:31:40] <leyyin> for STK it crashes gcc
[2015/11/13 15:31:43] <leyyin> out of memory
[2015/11/13 15:31:54] <maths22> on the old one or the new one?
[2015/11/13 15:31:56] <leyyin> with make -j 32
[2015/11/13 15:31:59] <leyyin> the old one
[2015/11/13 15:32:49] <maths22> leyyin: did it do that with a lower number of parallel jobs, or did it actually build
[2015/11/13 15:33:05] <maths22> Also, seee the table here: http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/
[2015/11/13 15:33:17] <leyyin> nproc tells me there are 32
[2015/11/13 15:34:06] <leyyin> for the editor it did build
[2015/11/13 15:34:33] <maths22> See http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/speeding-up-the-build/#Parallelizing-your-build-on-one-VM
[2015/11/13 15:34:39] <maths22> That is where I got the 1.5 number
[2015/11/13 15:34:46] <maths22> Maybe that is only the new infrastructure
[2015/11/13 15:39:37] <brmbrmcar> Side impact is harder!
[2015/11/13 15:42:26] <brmbrmcar> Weight to size ratio percent will change figures, but speed in kmh divided by 4.

[2015/11/13 16:14:34] <brmbrmcar> I reset .supertux2 and everything was fine.
[2015/11/13 16:14:58] <brmbrmcar> But it was the same version that was buggy before.

[2015/11/13 16:31:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could actually have something in the config which creates spritesheets from the files, couldn't we?

[2015/11/13 18:04:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe we're uploading po files to Transifex.
[2015/11/13 18:04:27] <Tobbi> Unfortunately I don't know the details.
[2015/11/13 18:04:31] <Tobbi> Ask giby when he gets back.
[2015/11/13 18:04:38] <Tobbi> or rather when he magically appears.
[2015/11/13 18:04:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, but are they all just added manually
[2015/11/13 18:05:06] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe currently they are.

[2015/11/14 14:25:08] <brmbrmcar> I checked status.github.com

[2015/11/14 14:31:56] <mt> so if https://github.com works something is wrong in your config
[2015/11/14 14:32:31] <brmbrmcar> git clone https://github.com/brmbrmcar/supertux.git
[2015/11/14 14:32:50] <mt> yeah

[2015/11/14 14:34:58] <mt> which file?
[2015/11/14 14:36:16] <mt> if you mean that: the size of a git repository is so much bigger than the actual content/source code because it keeps all history
[2015/11/14 14:36:41] <mt> it also downloads all history unless you specify a --depth
[2015/11/14 14:38:19] <brmbrmcar> It said everything was up to date when I pushed the changes.
[2015/11/14 14:38:38] @ bb010g joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/14 14:39:47] <mt> well obviously if you didn't push the squashed commit it won't know about that anymore after you deleted your local copy
[2015/11/14 14:40:15] <mt> now squash the commit, git push -f, and wait for the PR to get merged
[2015/11/14 14:40:48] <brmbrmcar> Oh no.

[2015/11/14 14:43:59] <brmbrmcar> case, please try git rebase (--continue | --abort | --skip)
[2015/11/14 14:43:59] <brmbrmcar> If that is not the case, please rm -fr "/home/brmbrmcar/supertux/.git/rebase-merge"

[2015/11/14 14:44:04] <brmbrmcar> valuable there.
[2015/11/14 14:44:23] <mt> well, git rebase --abort
[2015/11/14 14:44:27] <mt> I'd suggest
[2015/11/14 14:44:49] <mt> then `git rebase -i HEAD~2`
[2015/11/14 14:44:50] <brmbrmcar> I did it.
[2015/11/14 14:45:02] <brmbrmcar> And the commits have gone again!
[2015/11/14 14:45:17] <mt> well, so you didn't rebase -i ... yet?
[2015/11/14 14:45:26] <mt> then git reset --hard ... again
[2015/11/14 14:45:34] <mt> then git rebase -i ...
[2015/11/14 14:46:05] <mt> and in the editor coming up, change the 'pick' in front of 'ce83bfc' to 'squash'
[2015/11/14 14:46:09] <mt> then save + close
[2015/11/14 14:46:42] <mt> in the new editor window, set a commit message for the squashed commit
[2015/11/14 14:46:46] <mt> save+close again
[2015/11/14 14:46:53] <mt> -> you're done

[2015/11/14 14:48:17] <brmbrmcar> I did all that, but it still says everything is up to date.
[2015/11/14 14:48:37] <mt> paste `git log --oneline | head -n 10`

There is quite a social division, which results in extremist views emerging as people do not feel like they are part of the community.

[2015/11/14 16:29:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: Wasn't it the IS who planned that?
[2015/11/14 16:29:29] <Tobbi> So, they still originated from within france?
[2015/11/14 16:29:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah
[2015/11/14 16:29:36] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2015/11/14 16:29:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Probably
[2015/11/14 16:30:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe if something like that would've happened in Germany... we wouldn't be well prepared either.
[2015/11/14 16:31:02] <brmbrmcar> Scary!
[2015/11/14 16:31:39] <brmbrmcar> Bomb/bullet proof brm brm car
[2015/11/14 16:35:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: You know you got that email from that Google head hunter right? What happened then? I think Google is really cool :P
[2015/11/14 16:35:30] <Tobbi> Karkus: I told him that I'd be thrilled, and sent him my CV.
[2015/11/14 16:35:35] <Tobbi> He forwarded that to the European guys.
[2015/11/14 16:35:42] <Tobbi> He originally thought I was from the US.
[2015/11/14 16:35:51] <Tobbi> And apparently the European guys didn't have any openings for me.
[2015/11/14 16:36:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, right D:
[2015/11/14 16:36:00] <Tobbi> I wonder whether my CV was wrong.
[2015/11/14 16:36:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I listed all programming languages I know even remotely...
[2015/11/14 16:36:17] <Tobbi> Maybe that was wrong.
[2015/11/14 16:36:31] <Tobbi> But I was so excited and wanted to give a good impression...
[2015/11/14 16:36:33] <Tobbi> So, yeah.
[2015/11/14 16:37:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: Probably just bad timing...
[2015/11/14 16:37:14] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2015/11/14 16:37:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, some people I talked to told me to try again. I might.
[2015/11/14 16:37:49] <brmbrmcar> What about brmbrmcar programming language? You just type things in and nothing happens.
[2015/11/14 16:37:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: You should. What do you have to lose by sending off an email?
[2015/11/14 16:37:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's true.
[2015/11/14 16:38:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: But it's weird that "Google applies with you for a job" :D
[2015/11/14 16:38:28] <Tobbi> Normally, it's the other way round.
[2015/11/14 16:39:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: They want the best of the best, so they search everywhere
[2015/11/14 16:39:18] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2015/11/14 16:39:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: But if they didn't take me that means I am not the best of the best.
[2015/11/14 16:39:35] <Karkus> Depending on where I head in the future, I might try to apply there
[2015/11/14 16:39:43] <Tobbi> So, maybe it doesn't make sense to apply again.
[2015/11/14 16:39:49] <brmbrmcar> Google is wierd.
[2015/11/14 16:40:07] <brmbrmcar> Google is not monopoly.
[2015/11/14 16:40:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: They might not have been looking for many applicants then
[2015/11/14 16:40:22] <Tobbi> Probably not.
[2015/11/14 16:40:29] <Tobbi> Still, I am not sure if I want to work at Google.
[2015/11/14 16:40:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: As you said, the guy who headhunted you thought you were American
[2015/11/14 16:40:52] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/11/14 16:41:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why ever not?
[2015/11/14 16:41:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, if you strip all the benefits off Google, at the end of the day, it's still a job.
[2015/11/14 16:41:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: The benefits are potentially tempting for me.
[2015/11/14 16:41:52] <brmbrmcar> I want to compete with Google.
[2015/11/14 16:41:54] <Tobbi> So, I might get more inclined to take a job at Google without looking for possibly better suiting alternatives.
[2015/11/14 16:42:00] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Compete with yourself, first.
[2015/11/14 16:42:08] <Tobbi> *better-suited
[2015/11/14 16:42:25] <brmbrmcar> I want to make software for driverless brm brm cars!
[2015/11/14 16:42:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Google is a nice environment, supposedly
[2015/11/14 16:43:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's made that way to make you productive.
[2015/11/14 16:43:21] <Tobbi> I assume.
[2015/11/14 16:43:40] <Karkus> Yeah
[2015/11/14 16:43:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, of course I am looking for prestige in my life and want everyone to think I am something special. And that's why it's so tempting to apply again.
[2015/11/14 16:44:08] <Tobbi> And that's why I want to think twice before doing so. I know my weaknesses. And prestige and money are two of them.
[2015/11/14 16:44:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: You don't have to work somewhere special to be special. You have to do something special
[2015/11/14 16:44:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: Money and prestige...
[2015/11/14 16:44:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know. But what I really want is come to terms with myself.
[2015/11/14 16:45:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: The thing I find enticing about Google is the 20% time.
[2015/11/14 16:45:33] <Tobbi> 20% to work on your own projects?
[2015/11/14 16:45:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Also, Google love people who work on open source projects
[2015/11/14 16:45:46] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/11/14 16:45:47] <Tobbi> right
[2015/11/14 16:45:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: As long as it has something to do with Google
[2015/11/14 16:46:01] <brmbrmcar> And no Google's rubbish that causes high speed crashes

[2015/11/15 07:55:59] <brmbrmcar> Any idea how to fight conflicting poackages without removing anythging?
[2015/11/15 07:56:13] <Karkus> conflicting packages???
[2015/11/15 07:56:33] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/15 07:56:42] <brmbrmcar> I can't build 0.0.6.
[2015/11/15 07:56:52] <Karkus> What's conflicting?
[2015/11/15 07:56:53] <brmbrmcar> So I am using a .deb file.
[2015/11/15 07:57:08] <brmbrmcar> Supertux 0.0.6 and supertux-stable
[2015/11/15 08:00:45] <Karkus> No, I have no idea :(
[2015/11/15 08:02:45] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/15 08:03:08] <brmbrmcar> I amtrying to create a Console command for MNID_RESETLEVEL.
[2015/11/15 08:03:22] <brmbrmcar> But I have no idea how to.
[2015/11/15 08:04:43] <Karkus> You want a console command which resets the level?
[2015/11/15 08:05:07] <Karkus> brmbrmcar:^
[2015/11/15 08:05:17] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/15 08:05:35] <brmbrmcar> I want a console command for a lot of things.
[2015/11/15 08:07:09] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Make an issue with all the commands you want
[2015/11/15 08:07:14] <brmbrmcar> K.
[2015/11/15 08:07:24] <brmbrmcar> But I will implement themall.
[2015/11/15 08:08:02] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: If you make an issue, we will be able to see what's going on, and help you :)
[2015/11/15 08:09:04] <brmbrmcar> Where?
[2015/11/15 08:09:08] <brmbrmcar> OnGithub?
[2015/11/15 08:10:46] <Karkus> Yes please

[2015/11/15 08:27:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: IPC with SuperTux might be difficult, though.
[2015/11/15 08:27:20] <Tobbi> IPC = Inter Process Communication.
[2015/11/15 08:27:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I didn't say it would be easy, or possible
[2015/11/15 08:27:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: ik
[2015/11/15 08:27:33] <Tobbi> It'd need a server that could run and get the commands.
[2015/11/15 08:27:42] <Tobbi> You know, run in the background.
[2015/11/15 08:27:54] <Tobbi> We could make that dependent on the developer switch.
[2015/11/15 08:28:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: So we would use sockets?

[2015/11/15 09:05:01] <Karkus> grumbel: My plans are to make it better than the current editor, and more portable
[2015/11/15 09:05:42] <Karkus> grumbel: https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/issues
[2015/11/15 09:07:45] <Karkus> grumbel: Tobbi had issues getting the current editor to work on Mac OSX, and we need an editor which will stay updated as the game does

[2015/11/15 09:21:55] <grumbel> Karkus: looks fine so far
[2015/11/15 09:23:11] <Tobbi> I really wonder whether the latest glbinding would work with SuperTux.
[2015/11/15 09:23:55] <Karkus> grumbel: I've also thought about a plugin API
[2015/11/15 09:26:28] <Karkus> grumbel: And IPC so the editor can affect what happens more than just by passing arguments
[2015/11/15 09:27:22] <grumbel> sounds like overkill
[2015/11/15 09:28:53] <Karkus> grumbel: Why? I want a tux object for the player to move and then he spawns there
[2015/11/15 09:29:07] <Karkus> I want a lot of things :P
[2015/11/15 09:29:15] <grumbel> ./supertux levelname.stl --start-pos x,y
[2015/11/15 09:30:08] <grumbel> I'd prefer something simple that actually works, then some pie-in-the-sky thing that never gets finished and makes portability harder
[2015/11/15 09:30:33] <Karkus> grumbel: Yeah, I see what you mean
[2015/11/15 09:31:18] <grumbel> I would focus on basic stuff, i.e. add auto-smoothing to the tile painting
[2015/11/15 09:31:29] <Karkus> auto smoothing?
[2015/11/15 09:31:54] <grumbel> automatically painting the edge tiles so you don't have to do that manually
[2015/11/15 09:32:08] <grumbel> the C# has a function for that, but it's not that great there either
[2015/11/15 09:32:12] <Karkus> Oh, yeah I thought about that too :)
[2015/11/15 09:32:19] <Tobbi> I wonder how we'd go about doing that... It needs to be simple.
[2015/11/15 09:32:33] <Karkus> What about slopes?
[2015/11/15 09:33:17] <grumbel> Has anybody played with the SuperMarioMaker thing on WiiU?
[2015/11/15 09:33:27] <Karkus> grumbel: Yup :)
[2015/11/15 09:33:47] <Karkus> grumbel: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/103
[2015/11/15 09:34:28] <Karkus> That kind of gameplay could exist like the old 0.1.x editor
[2015/11/15 09:34:54] <Tobbi> I still think that supertux's UI isn't the best choice for this kind of advanced editor.
[2015/11/15 09:37:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's why I want to continue with Flexlay
[2015/11/15 09:37:14] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/11/15 09:37:28] <grumbel> Tobbi: it wouldn't need to be advanced, just something that lets people build levels easily
[2015/11/15 09:37:37] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/11/15 09:39:18] <Karkus> grumbel: Also, there are a few files (including everything in flexlay/wip, flexlay/[canvas, brush, brushmask].py etc.) which I don't understand the intended purpose of, and cannot find any information on what needs doing
[2015/11/15 09:39:21] <Tobbi> grumbel: By the way: After removing directories from tinygettext and rebuilding the cache, how would I go about refreshing the UI?
[2015/11/15 09:41:28] <grumbel> Karkus: Those are classes from the C++ code that haven't been ported over yet
[2015/11/15 09:41:45] <grumbel> Karkus: the Python editor is basically a 1:1 translation of the C++ code
[2015/11/15 09:44:38] <grumbel> Karkus: http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/flexlaypaint8.png
[2015/11/15 09:44:45] <Karkus> grumbel: Okay, I will look into that
[2015/11/15 09:44:52] <grumbel> flexlay used to have some drawing functionality
[2015/11/15 09:45:25] <grumbel> Canvas was the pixel buffer, brush and brushmask where the brushes you could draw into that pixel buffer
[2015/11/15 09:45:33] <Tobbi> I guess I will just display a message to please restart the game after installing language packs.
[2015/11/15 09:45:42] <grumbel> can be ignored for the moment, it's not really needed for supertux
[2015/11/15 09:46:50] <grumbel> something different: I cleaned up the lisp parser code and optimized it a bit: https://github.com/lispparser/sexp-cpp
[2015/11/15 09:47:21] <Tobbi> grumbel: Can you do a pull request against the SuperTux repo?
[2015/11/15 09:47:55] <Karkus> grumbel: Can I move the canvas files etc. into wip/ so they're out of the way?
[2015/11/15 09:48:06] <Karkus> Or onto a different branch?
[2015/11/15 09:48:54] <grumbel> Karkus: put them in wip/
[2015/11/15 09:49:31] <grumbel> Tobbi: will need some further work to integrate, I'll send a push request one day
[2015/11/15 09:49:39] <Tobbi> Thanks.
[2015/11/15 09:55:58] <grumbel> Tobbi: about refreshing the GUI with new translation, easiest would be to restart the main loop, i.e. the part in Main::launch_game()
[2015/11/15 09:56:12] <Tobbi> grumbel: But doing so from the UI?
[2015/11/15 09:56:40] <grumbel> Tobbi: maybe throw a TranslationUpdated exception or something like that?
[2015/11/15 09:56:53] <Tobbi> I could do that, actually.
[2015/11/15 09:56:55] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2015/11/15 10:00:32] <Tobbi> Actually, if I pop the screen, then push a new TitleScreen, this could work.
[2015/11/15 10:05:39] <Karkus> grumbel: Was the auto-smoothing a different tool?
[2015/11/15 10:06:25] <grumbel> Karkus: flexlay never really had auto-smoothing (other then some experimental script that never worked well)
[2015/11/15 10:06:40] <Karkus> grumbel: Well, what do you want then?
[2015/11/15 10:07:58] <grumbel> A tile tool that lets me select "snow" tiles and then paint them around while auto-smoothing the edges
[2015/11/15 10:08:58] <grumbel> The C# smoothing tool is a separate tool that you use to smooth out the tiles after you have painted them
[2015/11/15 10:09:27] <grumbel> It sort of works and could be ported over to Flexlay, but it's not quite as easy to use as I would like
[2015/11/15 10:09:54] <grumbel> The tricky part is that a lot of tilemaps in SuperTux aren't conceptually clean
[2015/11/15 10:10:00] <Tobbi> I was also thinking of a scenery creation tool that allows you to select different slopes and place them, and it'll automatically create a smooth scenery.
[2015/11/15 10:10:51] <grumbel> i.e. you might have tiles spread over different layers and such or special tiles that still look like other tiles
[2015/11/15 10:12:25] <grumbel> not sure how to deal with slopes, in flexlay/netpanzer-editor I had the ability to flatten/unflatten groups of tiles into objects
[2015/11/15 10:12:38] <grumbel> http://www.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/flexlay/images/netpanzer-1.jpg
[2015/11/15 10:12:39] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 272 seconds
[2015/11/15 10:12:56] <grumbel> that might work with slopes as well
[2015/11/15 10:13:39] <grumbel> are there any editors out there that deal with slopes well?

[2015/11/15 10:22:34] <Tobbi> hrm, restarting the main loop doesn't want to work.
[2015/11/15 10:22:52] <Tobbi> I mean: Clearly it works, but it doesn't fix the problem.
[2015/11/15 10:23:10] <Tobbi> I tried clearing the menu stack which won't work either.
[2015/11/15 10:25:17] <grumbel> Tobbi: MenuManager needs to be recreated
[2015/11/15 10:25:30] <Tobbi> Alright...
[2015/11/15 10:25:43] <Tobbi> grumbel: Can't I do that without restarting the main loop?
[2015/11/15 10:26:23] <grumbel> MenuManager is part of ScreenManager
[2015/11/15 10:27:01] <grumbel> Maybe, but I don't now where all the strings are hiding

[2015/11/15 10:53:11] <Tobbi> Not that I expected it to work.

[2015/11/15 10:55:24] <Tobbi> I give up for now.
[2015/11/15 10:56:07] <Tobbi> I even tried to restart the main loop which didn't work either.
[2015/11/15 10:57:40] <Karkus> Why do you need to refresh the menu?
[2015/11/15 10:58:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: Because otherwise it won't pick up new translations...
[2015/11/15 10:58:11] <Karkus> When you change language normally it works though...
[2015/11/15 10:58:19] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/11/15 10:58:22] <Tobbi> that's true...
[2015/11/15 10:58:26] <Tobbi> Let me check something.
[2015/11/15 10:58:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: It puts you back to the first (main) menu
[2015/11/15 10:59:01] <Tobbi> Yeah.

[2015/11/15 12:07:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: You can't activate the switch in edit mode
[2015/11/15 12:07:51] <mt> head8debian: there's the official docs and #arduino
[2015/11/15 12:07:53] <Tobbi> Karkus: If you press Action, it returns...
[2015/11/15 12:07:55] <brmbrmcar> Press action.
[2015/11/15 12:08:00] <Tobbi> And then press the switch.

[2015/11/15 12:08:26] <brmbrmcar> Can you not read the infoblock?
[2015/11/15 12:08:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: I updated the testcase.
[2015/11/15 12:08:51] <Tobbi> Just activate the switch and it should crash.
[2015/11/15 12:11:41] <Tobbi> Actually...
[2015/11/15 12:12:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: How do I press the switch in edit mode?
[2015/11/15 12:12:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: Press action key (left ctrl key for me)
[2015/11/15 12:13:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah, okay
[2015/11/15 12:13:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, let me try in the console
[2015/11/15 12:13:57] <Tobbi> I believe that works.
[2015/11/15 12:14:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, it doesn't crash?
[2015/11/15 12:14:20] <Tobbi> I believe so.
[2015/11/15 12:14:31] <brmbrmcar> The console does not crash it.
[2015/11/15 12:14:59] <Karkus> What does the action key actually do while in edit mode?
[2015/11/15 12:15:15] <brmbrmcar> Let Tux move again.
[2015/11/15 12:17:49] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Turn edit mode off?
[2015/11/15 12:22:14] <Karkus> Okay, I believe I understand the issue now
[2015/11/15 12:24:09] <Tobbi> I am having trouble finding the cause of this.
[2015/11/15 12:28:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: I have no idea where to look :/
[2015/11/15 12:28:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe this might be some issue inside Squirrel...
[2015/11/15 12:29:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is Level.edit already set to false by pressing the action key?
[2015/11/15 12:29:08] <Tobbi> Probably?
[2015/11/15 12:29:26] <Tobbi> Actually, we could circumvent this, probably.
[2015/11/15 12:30:27] <Karkus> http://squirrel-lang.org/ works for me now
[2015/11/15 12:35:29] <Tobbi> I don't understand the issue at all.
[2015/11/15 12:36:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: Also, try restarting the level after pressing the action key while in edit mode.
[2015/11/15 12:36:23] <Tobbi> ok.
[2015/11/15 12:36:57] <Karkus> Actually, that's probably intended behaviour
[2015/11/15 12:37:21] <Karkus> Well, probably not.
[2015/11/15 12:37:34] <Tobbi> So, apparently we are still in edit mode.
[2015/11/15 12:38:33] <Karkus> Yup.
[2015/11/15 12:48:50] <grumbel> Tobbi: https://github.com/SuperTux/tinygettext/commit/d0155106c9b770f7ff28070c60f39337f12e8f47 there is no need to #ifdef that stuff out, all log callbacks are configurable

[2015/11/15 15:00:09] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: This has nothing to do with anything. This adds 1 line which isn't even code.
[2015/11/15 15:00:19] <brmbrmcar> And you forgot ci skip!
[2015/11/15 15:00:26] <Karkus> I did :(
[2015/11/15 15:00:38] <brmbrmcar> I do exactly the same.
[2015/11/15 15:00:50] <brmbrmcar> All my commits were useless.
[2015/11/15 15:01:30] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Talking about useless commits, what exactly does https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/220 do?
[2015/11/15 15:02:39] <brmbrmcar> Make Tux invincible (like when he gets a star).

[2015/11/15 15:04:41] <datahead7777> Karkus, grumbel was in, several people were talking, I saw Travis messages, etc.  head 8 debian had already said it was busy, and I agreed
[2015/11/15 15:04:53] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: But sector.Tux.make_invincible(true) does that
[2015/11/15 15:05:03] <maths22> Karkus: it will actually work on every push
[2015/11/15 15:05:12] <Karkus> datahead7777: I suppose it's more active than usual
[2015/11/15 15:05:25] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: But we need shortcuts.
[2015/11/15 15:05:26] <Karkus> maths22: To your repo?
[2015/11/15 15:05:37] <maths22> Right now
[2015/11/15 15:05:41] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: I don't know about that
[2015/11/15 15:05:53] <maths22> The idea is that it will be switched to run off of the offical
[2015/11/15 15:06:04] * maths22 hit enter too soon
[2015/11/15 15:06:08] <Karkus> maths22: Why can't we do that now?
[2015/11/15 15:06:12] <brmbrmcar> Like fire(), ice(), air() earth(), growup()
[2015/11/15 15:06:27] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Okay
[2015/11/15 15:06:31] <Karkus> Let me see
[2015/11/15 15:06:53] <maths22> Karkus: because certain aspects don't work quite right yet, and (mostly for windows) several things need to be changed besides .travis.yml
[2015/11/15 15:07:00] <brmbrmcar> invincible() was actually a full script,but it is so short...
[2015/11/15 15:07:06] <Karkus> maths22: Oh, I see
[2015/11/15 15:07:10] <maths22> I want to make sure everything works right before we merge
[2015/11/15 15:07:43] <brmbrmcar> Will tinygettext be in there?

[2015/11/15 15:10:04] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: I don't understand... what's wrong with invincible()
[2015/11/15 15:10:20] <brmbrmcar> It runs in a loop.
[2015/11/15 15:10:31] <Karkus> which one?
[2015/11/15 15:10:46] <brmbrmcar> invincible()
[2015/11/15 15:12:43] <brmbrmcar> The coin limit needs to be increased.
[2015/11/15 15:18:37] <maths22> brmbrmcar: what about tinygettext
[2015/11/15 15:18:46] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Also, what coin limit
[2015/11/15 15:19:04] * maths22 forgets that question marks are a thing
[2015/11/15 15:21:29] <brmbrmcar> Will sudo dpkg -i work straight away.
[2015/11/15 15:22:12] <brmbrmcar> THe coin limit is too low; I reached it without cheating.

[2015/11/15 15:29:16] <Tobbi> Actually, guys, there have been quite a few levels that were removed from bonus island 3 but never added somewhere else ;)
[2015/11/15 15:30:05] <brmbrmcar> Which ones?
[2015/11/15 15:31:26] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: A lot of them.
[2015/11/15 15:31:27] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/15 15:32:21] <Tobbi> Take a look at https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/levels/bonus3/changelog.txt
[2015/11/15 15:32:28] <brmbrmcar> There needs to be more target times.
[2015/11/15 15:33:25] <brmbrmcar> For Icy Island.
[2015/11/15 15:34:35] <brmbrmcar> And in Two Tiny Towers, dispensers need to be changed from auto to left.

[2015/11/15 15:47:12] <maths22> brmbrmcar: What is the coin limit?
[2015/11/15 15:47:46] <maths22> Also, if you mean will dpkg -i install tinygettext, the answer is yes
[2015/11/15 15:48:24] <brmbrmcar> 9999
[2015/11/15 15:51:00] <maths22> brmbrmcar: OK
[2015/11/15 15:51:11] <brmbrmcar> Which is too low.
[2015/11/15 15:51:14] <maths22> I'll have to work on hitting it sometime
[2015/11/15 15:51:19] <maths22> (No checkpoints for me)
[2015/11/15 15:51:27] <brmbrmcar> Where ist this set?
[2015/11/15 15:56:40] <brmbrmcar> I have changed in brmbrmcar:coins
[2015/11/15 16:11:58] <head8debian> Tobbi: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/1105f486/
[2015/11/15 16:12:14] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I think the better question to ask is: why do we have a coin limit?
[2015/11/15 16:12:36] <maths22> Is there a reason to keep it and increase it, or should it be eliminated?
[2015/11/15 16:12:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: does it work?
[2015/11/15 16:12:56] <maths22> head8debian: what is that for?
[2015/11/15 16:13:14] <brmbrmcar> To stop cheats.
[2015/11/15 16:13:32] <maths22> What kind of cheats does it stop?
[2015/11/15 16:14:05] <brmbrmcar> I don't know, someone who wants a load of checkpoints.
[2015/11/15 16:14:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't have the resistors for my photocells, so i don't know... :-/
[2015/11/15 16:14:19] <head8debian> maths22: An arduino.
[2015/11/15 16:14:22] <brmbrmcar> But we should let that happen anyway.
[2015/11/15 16:14:33] <head8debian> I honestly hope it will work.
[2015/11/15 16:14:36] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/15 16:14:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: I want to *sigh* also...
[2015/11/15 16:15:09] <maths22> brmbrmcar: with the console, you can already cheat in whatever way you want
[2015/11/15 16:15:11] <brmbrmcar> *bold*
[2015/11/15 16:15:17] <head8debian> Its taken alot of my energy trying to come up with that...
[2015/11/15 16:15:28] <brmbrmcar> maths22: I know, so the limit is useless.
[2015/11/15 16:15:45] <maths22> (I actually decided to not enable the console last time I wiped my config because I kept using fire() and ghost mode
[2015/11/15 16:15:49] <maths22> Ghost mode is so much fun ...
[2015/11/15 16:16:10] <brmbrmcar> But I don't want to remove it entirely, as doing so may cause bugs.
[2015/11/15 16:16:19] <brmbrmcar> How do you enable ghost mode?
[2015/11/15 16:16:39] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It should be set to INT_MAX
[2015/11/15 16:16:50] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/15 16:17:38] <maths22> I believe it is 'sector.Tux.ghost_mode(true)', but I may remember wrong
[2015/11/15 16:19:06] <brmbrmcar> The sector ghost_mode does not exist.

[2015/11/15 19:22:16] <maths22> I'm a little bit concerned with regards to the licensing on the new worldmap Restaurated island
[2015/11/15 19:22:27] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/15 19:22:58] <Tobbi> LMH: Try to print the value of that boolean flag m_langpack_mode or something to the console and then see what might be wrong.
[2015/11/15 19:23:13] <maths22> The fan site does not appear to have required uploaders to grant any rights to SuperTux/have given any license at all
[2015/11/15 19:23:57] <Tobbi> maths22: ...and it might be fairly difficult to get the original authors to grant the licenses in retrospective.
[2015/11/15 19:24:14] <Tobbi> maths22: Can't we make the whole worldmap "all rights reserved"?
[2015/11/15 19:24:27] <maths22> Tobbi: I don't disagree
[2015/11/15 19:24:43] <maths22> My concern is mostly with the "credit-taking" done in the intial level
[2015/11/15 19:24:57] <Tobbi> That will be fixed. LMH is working on it.
[2015/11/15 19:25:02] <maths22> Tobbi: great
[2015/11/15 19:25:04] <Tobbi> Or rather, has agreed to work on that.
[2015/11/15 19:25:09] <Tobbi> maths22: hume overshot a little.
[2015/11/15 19:25:42] <LMH> yeah, I didn't even think about the licensing
[2015/11/15 19:25:44] <maths22> Tobbi: we actually probably need to put something on that worldmap which explicitly "un-GPLs" it
[2015/11/15 19:25:56] <Tobbi> Yeah...
[2015/11/15 19:26:34] <Tobbi> maths22: On the other hand: If it's not under the GPL that means that hume had no rights to modify the contents of the levels in the first place.
[2015/11/15 19:26:43] <maths22> Tobbi: that is also probably true
[2015/11/15 19:27:04] <Tobbi> So, the legally right way would be to remove the worldmap altogether.
[2015/11/15 19:27:11] <maths22> Tobbi: that is actually correct
[2015/11/15 19:27:21] <maths22> We could distribute them unmodified, but then they would be unplayable
[2015/11/15 19:27:24] <LMH> anyone have access to the originals?  I'd like to know if any licensing was with the originals
[2015/11/15 19:27:43] <Tobbi> Many of them are on http://a062.apm.etc.tu-bs.de/pmlvls.php
[2015/11/15 19:27:58] <maths22> LMH: most of them don't seem to have licensing attached
[2015/11/15 19:27:59] <Tobbi> I even believe all of them.
[2015/11/15 19:28:21] <maths22> Tobbi: what do you mean?
[2015/11/15 19:28:32] <Tobbi> maths22: I believe all of them are from the fan site above.
[2015/11/15 19:28:46] <LMH> well, then the safe thing is to simply remove the addon
[2015/11/15 19:28:47] <maths22> Tobbi: given the intro, I think that is correct
[2015/11/15 19:28:55] <maths22> LMH: I sadly agree
[2015/11/15 19:29:00] <Tobbi> It's a shame, really...
[2015/11/15 19:29:16] <maths22> Especially given the work put into transforming them
[2015/11/15 19:29:18] <LMH> bah- wish I had thought of that first instead of cleaning up that intro
[2015/11/15 19:29:33] <maths22> LMH: actually, if possible, it should be removed from the git history and force pushed
[2015/11/15 19:30:23] <LMH> I can do that, might be messy for those who use the repo, but that should only be a few
[2015/11/15 19:31:06] <maths22> I agree, but that way we are defintely safe
[2015/11/15 19:31:08] <Not-6fa5> [02supertux] 03Success. The Travis CI build passed - 13https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux/builds/91295562
[2015/11/15 19:31:31] <maths22> LMH: By the way, I really like Fiona's world
[2015/11/15 19:31:43] <maths22> It's fun for if I want a worldmap that is easy to play through
[2015/11/15 19:31:55] <maths22> (Hume has some nice ones for the other end of the spectrum...)
[2015/11/15 19:32:07] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/15 19:34:39] <maths22> Also, if there is an updated fan site ever, any submissions should be required to be CC licensed
[2015/11/15 19:34:40] <LMH> maths22: thanks! that was the idea
[2015/11/15 19:34:49] <LMH> agreed
[2015/11/15 19:35:02] <maths22> (I think the CC license is more appropriate for levels than the GPL)
[2015/11/15 19:35:17] <LMH> of course the fan site was never an official piece of the project
[2015/11/15 19:35:17] <maths22> Since levels aren't source code, the GPL doesn't apply very well
[2015/11/15 19:35:28] <Tobbi> Couldn't we have our own site where people are allowed to upload their creations?
[2015/11/15 19:35:30] <maths22> LMH: I know
[2015/11/15 19:35:42] <maths22> Tobbi: yes
[2015/11/15 19:35:42] <LMH> Tobbi: that would be great
[2015/11/15 19:35:50] <Tobbi> I have been thinking about this, and it could integrate as well with the flexlay editor.
[2015/11/15 19:36:03] <Tobbi> Aka, allow people to upload levels directly from flexlay.
[2015/11/15 19:36:22] <maths22> Tobbi: if we have a clear vision, I am happy to work on the web-half implementation (and could probably provide the hosting)
[2015/11/15 19:36:24] <LMH> that would be cool
[2015/11/15 19:36:44] <Tobbi> maths22: Actually, file an issue against flexlay...
[2015/11/15 19:36:58] <Tobbi> maths22: How would the upload part look? POST?
[2015/11/15 19:37:12] <Tobbi> Sending a POST request from Python might be good.
[2015/11/15 19:37:18] <maths22> Tobbi: probably
[2015/11/15 19:37:18] <Tobbi> Or whatever there is.
[2015/11/15 19:37:37] <maths22> We would probably want to require authentication
[2015/11/15 19:37:43] <Tobbi> http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/ :P
[2015/11/15 19:37:47] <Tobbi> So, that's covered.
[2015/11/15 19:38:13] <maths22> Well, I'm off to dinner now
[2015/11/15 19:38:19] <Tobbi> sure.
[2015/11/15 19:38:20] <maths22> Good night to those of you in Europe
[2015/11/15 19:38:25] <Tobbi> good night.
[2015/11/15 19:38:30] <maths22> What time is it where you are?
[2015/11/15 19:39:18] <Tobbi> 1:37am
[2015/11/15 19:39:30] <maths22> 6:37 pm here
[2015/11/15 19:39:46] <LMH> 2:37 pm  here
[2015/11/15 19:40:40] <Tobbi> We're distributed all over the world, alright.
[2015/11/15 19:41:01] <maths22> I think it's kind of fun
[2015/11/15 19:41:10] <LMH> indeed
[2015/11/15 19:41:58] <Tobbi> So, I suggest a review queue where people from the team can review them before pushing them to the add-on repository...
[2015/11/15 19:42:00] <Tobbi> and stuff like that.
[2015/11/15 19:42:06] <Tobbi> But this is a huge undertaking anyway.
[2015/11/15 19:43:31] <maths22> A project for when I finish nightly builds
[2015/11/15 19:43:37] <maths22> :)
[2015/11/15 19:44:05] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/15 19:44:07] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/15 19:44:09] <Tobbi> Anyway, good night.
[2015/11/15 19:44:32] <LMH> we could tap into the community, let them rate levels and when they are seen as popular/stable enough we snag them for the repo
[2015/11/15 19:44:40] <LMH> oh, sorry good night
[2015/11/15 19:46:37] <Tobbi> LMH: That could work as well. But that's for post-0.4.0
[2015/11/15 19:47:06] <LMH> agreed
[2015/11/15 19:47:52] <Tobbi> LMH: So, can you file issues against the add-ons repository re. website etc.?
[2015/11/15 19:49:23] <LMH> Tobbi, I'm working on a full removal from the history, think we should tighten up access to that repo?
[2015/11/15 19:49:44] <Tobbi> LMH: We could. I believe HUme would complain, though.
[2015/11/15 19:49:53] <Tobbi> We just need to make sure that he sticks to the rules.
[2015/11/15 19:53:44] <LMH> he didn't follow the format either- we'll have to ask that he has anything reviewed first
[2015/11/15 19:54:18] <LMH> the addon repo is a little harder to deal with, requires some advanced knowledge
[2015/11/15 19:55:44] <Tobbi> I had trouble with it as well...
[2015/11/15 19:56:51] <LMH> I know, it is not trivial to work with- took me some time after it was remade to work properly
[2015/11/15 19:58:18] <Tobbi> LMH: But if we had a proper website with a backend, that would make things easier. We could create all the values automatically.
[2015/11/15 19:58:50] <LMH> that's true, would save me a lot of time when changing addons
[2015/11/15 20:09:09] @ Quit: Tobbi: 
[2015/11/15 20:30:42] <maths22> A proper website would be a very nice thing, and a nice future project
[2015/11/15 20:33:26] <maths22> Also, do we have a proper 0.4.0 todo list?
[2015/11/15 20:35:28] <LMH> maths22: I have not checked the todos for some time so honestly I'm not sure what state they are in.  I do agree that the website could use a bit of an overhaul.

[2015/11/15 21:42:38] <head8debian> maths22: Propper website? We just overhauled the current one (supertux.github.io) this spring.

[2015/11/15 21:46:14] <head8debian> frankly*

[2015/11/16 12:56:53] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Was there any discussion about Restaured Island I removal?
[2015/11/16 12:57:10] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Not that I'm aware of.
[2015/11/16 12:58:06] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Someone has to explain LMH what the Restaurator Island I is. He is often not there unfortunately.
[2015/11/16 12:58:39] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Yes.
[2015/11/16 12:58:47] <Hume2> We should reformulate the red part to make it clear to LMH.
[2015/11/16 12:59:13] <Hume2> Could you help me? Just write me a text file and I'll put it into the infoblocks.
[2015/11/16 12:59:27] <brmbrmcar> OK...
[2015/11/16 12:59:39] <brmbrmcar> So about the copyright stuff?
[2015/11/16 12:59:47] <Hume2> Yes, exactly.
[2015/11/16 13:00:23] <Hume2> I don't know the law terms in the other languages, so that's why I ask you to do it.

[2015/11/16 13:37:59] <brmbrmcar> Ok.
[2015/11/16 13:38:10] <brmbrmcar> I am restauring the next level.

[2015/11/16 13:44:19] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Thanks, but I still had some notes for levels 6 and 7.
[2015/11/16 13:44:51] <brmbrmcar> I thought I'd have to finish 7.
[2015/11/16 13:45:03] <brmbrmcar> The empty bonus blocks...
[2015/11/16 13:45:50] <Hume2> Well...
[2015/11/16 13:46:03] <brmbrmcar> I shall fix now.
[2015/11/16 13:46:36] <brmbrmcar> What shall I replace them with?
[2015/11/16 13:47:14] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It's hard to explain when you can't see me while working on it.
[2015/11/16 13:47:34] <brmbrmcar> Snow?
[2015/11/16 13:47:48] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes. You know me :D
[2015/11/16 13:48:23] <Hume2> I'll give you some examples of proper terrain: snow, darksow, forest ground, stone brick walls ...
[2015/11/16 13:49:16] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You can't get bellow those blocks, so the empty space bellow them is useless.
[2015/11/16 13:50:10] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Do you know Narreland? There's one strange thing that is in most of the Narreland levels. Do you know what is it?
[2015/11/16 13:50:38] <brmbrmcar> Is it the snow covering the feet?
[2015/11/16 13:51:05] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: That's hard to say.
[2015/11/16 13:51:39] <brmbrmcar> What is it then?
[2015/11/16 13:51:52] <Hume2> I make it usually not-covering the feet, because of the flames.
[2015/11/16 13:52:19] <Hume2> When you set the z-pos of interactive layer to 51, it covers the feet...
[2015/11/16 13:53:02] <Hume2> ...but it covers also all the flames, so they hide in the terrain and it's tricky to pass them.

[2015/11/16 13:58:18] <Hume2> It's contraproductive. So I'll remove the red part.

[2015/11/16 15:20:52] <maths22> You posted it above
[2015/11/16 15:23:14] <brmbrmcar> I made it myself.
[2015/11/16 15:23:38] <brmbrmcar> Noone owns any rights tyo it.
[2015/11/16 15:24:05] <maths22> brmbrmcar: My quesiton is because, at least under US copyright law, it is not really correct
[2015/11/16 15:24:33] <maths22> For something to qualify as "fair use" in the US, it must satisfy 4 conditions in some combination
[2015/11/16 15:24:47] <maths22> (US copyright law is confusing, but here is the basic idea)
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the purpose and character of your use
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the nature of the copyrighted work
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the effect of the use upon the potential market.
[2015/11/16 15:25:07] <brmbrmcar> Yeah, but think of it this way: if we were that strict on copyright, everything would be banned.
[2015/11/16 15:25:12] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Nope
[2015/11/16 15:25:19] <maths22> Most of our stuff has a CC license
[2015/11/16 15:25:22] <maths22> that lets us use it
[2015/11/16 15:25:49] <maths22> By default, we cannot use anything-permission must be explicitly granted (except for the specific carve-outs for "fair use")
[2015/11/16 15:25:54] <brmbrmcar> And also, how does this apply internationally?
[2015/11/16 15:26:15] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I can look into that, that said, I assume we want to be allowed to distribute the game in the US
[2015/11/16 15:26:38] <brmbrmcar> Exactly.
[2015/11/16 15:26:47] <brmbrmcar> It needs to be legal everywhere.
[2015/11/16 15:27:31] <maths22> CC licenses are "certified" as internationally valid
[2015/11/16 15:27:59] <brmbrmcar> THink of it this way: if Hukme
[2015/11/16 15:28:00] <maths22> (The GPL, while also internationally valid, does not apply to levels, which are really data not source code)
[2015/11/16 15:28:20] <brmbrmcar> randomally created those levels, would that be illegel?
[2015/11/16 15:28:34] <maths22> brmbrmcar: no, but that is irrelevant
[2015/11/16 15:28:50] <maths22> It is a known fact that they were created from the fan site levels
[2015/11/16 15:29:11] <maths22> His ability to create them independently does not make them any less tied to the originals
[2015/11/16 15:30:11] <brmbrmcar> But it is relevant, nbecause it is exactly the same.
[2015/11/16 15:30:29] <brmbrmcar> The proccess is not important.
[2015/11/16 15:30:35] <maths22> brmbrmcar: That is not true
[2015/11/16 15:30:50] <maths22> If I looked at the fan site levels, and Hume's levels, they would clearly be related
[2015/11/16 15:31:02] <maths22> Further, we have documentation, in several forms, that they are related
[2015/11/16 15:31:18] <maths22> Therefore, legally, Hume's levels are a derivative work of the original
[2015/11/16 15:32:20] <brmbrmcar> OK then. You win.
[2015/11/16 15:32:36] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I feel sorry for Hume, because I can tell he put a lot of work into the levels
[2015/11/16 15:32:43] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2015/11/16 15:33:12] <brmbrmcar> And I tried restoring some levels, and it isn't as easy as it sounds.
[2015/11/16 15:33:41] <maths22> LMH, Tobbi, and I discussed it last night, and collectively determined that, at least without consulting a lawyer, it would not be a good idea to keep the addon as part of the project
[2015/11/16 15:35:45] <brmbrmcar> :(

[2015/11/16 17:19:00] <maths22> Tobbi: the "metal" ones don't really look out of place in an icy world
[2015/11/16 17:19:09] <maths22> I can't say the same about the wooden ones
[2015/11/16 17:19:13] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/16 17:19:24] <Tobbi> I think the wooden ones look rather ugly...
[2015/11/16 17:19:41] <maths22> To me, the cannons work, but if someone wanted, they could add some icicles or something like that
[2015/11/16 17:19:48] <maths22> Tobbi: I must agree on the wooden ones
[2015/11/16 17:20:04] <maths22> It does not help that half of the levels that use them just have them floating in the air
[2015/11/16 17:20:09] <Tobbi> Sometimes we don't want to show any dispenser...
[2015/11/16 17:20:19] <maths22> In my opinion, they should be ceiling mounted, in a cloud, or invisible
[2015/11/16 17:20:25] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/16 17:20:34] <Tobbi> But in a cloud, we sometimes don't want the dispenser to be visible.
[2015/11/16 17:20:36] <maths22> Also, why does fireflower no longer destroy dispensers?
[2015/11/16 17:20:44] <Tobbi> Change made by hume someday.
[2015/11/16 17:20:47] <maths22> Tobbi: In theory, the cloud should cover up the dispenser
[2015/11/16 17:21:05] <Tobbi> maths22: It does, but I'd rather have a flag on the dispenser that sets it to hidden.
[2015/11/16 17:21:06] <maths22> Tobbi: Same with why it doesn't destroy crystallo?
[2015/11/16 17:21:15] <Tobbi> Because fire shouldn
[2015/11/16 17:21:19] <Tobbi> 't melt a crystal.
[2015/11/16 17:21:23] <maths22> Tobbi: this is true
[2015/11/16 17:21:26] <Tobbi> But that's also a change hume introduced.
[2015/11/16 17:21:51] <maths22> Then again, fire also shouldn't melt the spiky shells, but we kind of have to ignore that
[2015/11/16 17:22:17] <maths22> Also, in my opinion, the new forest jumpy graphics are not the most attractive
[2015/11/16 17:22:25] <Tobbi> True...
[2015/11/16 17:22:30] <Tobbi> Maybe we should reset them?
[2015/11/16 17:22:41] <maths22> Tobbi: the metal ones didn't look out of place
[2015/11/16 17:22:57] <Tobbi> maths22: Yes, I agree... can you undo the changes?
[2015/11/16 17:23:11] <maths22> Tobbi: not right now, but I will try to remember for later
[2015/11/16 17:23:17] <Tobbi> Or I could.
[2015/11/16 17:23:20] <Tobbi> I'll have to see..
[2015/11/16 17:27:12] <Tobbi> maths22: Do I keep the sprites themselves for reference or do I revert that commit as well?

[2015/11/16 17:33:55] <maths22> Tobbi: I would keep the sprites

[2015/11/16 17:35:06] <maths22> They are in the git history if someone needs them
[2015/11/16 17:35:07] <Tobbi> maths22: No, I only got rid of the inclusion in the forest levels.
