[2016/02/01 06:12:39] <snadge> i know this is offtopic.. but i just installed extreme tuxracer
[2016/02/01 06:12:51] <Tobbi> snadge: ...and?
[2016/02/01 06:13:01] <snadge> i cant help but feel that it sucks
[2016/02/01 06:13:07] <snadge> lol
[2016/02/01 06:13:23] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/01 06:13:30] <snadge> i've got hours of longevity out of supertux
[2016/02/01 06:13:45] <Tobbi> Oh, 0.7.0 was just release.
[2016/02/01 06:13:48] <Tobbi> d
[2016/02/01 06:13:50] <snadge> its challenging.. fun.. frustrating.. all of these things.. the contributed stuff can be very clever / creative
[2016/02/01 06:13:51] <Tobbi> of extreme tux racer.
[2016/02/01 06:14:09] <snadge> but extreme tux racer.. hmm.. i cant help but feel the mechanics of that game sucks
[2016/02/01 06:14:18] <snadge> and initial impressions are.. there is nothing fun about it
[2016/02/01 06:14:26] <Tobbi> :P Okay, I do get it...
[2016/02/01 06:14:35] <Tobbi> snadge: But SuperTux and the racer are completely different games.
[2016/02/01 06:14:51] <snadge> yeah.. i think i need to see a guide to etracer to see if im playing it wrong or something
[2016/02/01 06:14:56] <snadge> but i just find it very dorky to control
[2016/02/01 06:15:12] <Tobbi> snadge: I think that's the game, really. Last time I tried it was like that as well.
[2016/02/01 06:19:02] <Tobbi> Maybe I should contribute to that instead.
[2016/02/01 06:19:07] <Tobbi> It needs more work than we do.
[2016/02/01 06:19:56] <snadge> a 3d supertux would be better imho
[2016/02/01 06:20:09] <Tobbi> snadge: There is one...Supertux 3D on sourceforge.
[2016/02/01 06:20:09] <snadge> kinda like the 3d mario on the nintendo ds

[2016/02/01 12:05:10] <brmbrmcar> What happened to Notifico?
[2016/02/01 12:05:17] <mt> it's been replaced

[2016/02/01 12:09:40] <mt> what's wrong with it?
[2016/02/01 12:09:50] <brmbrmcar> I just don't like it.
[2016/02/01 12:10:02] <mt> there has to be a reason for that
[2016/02/01 12:10:04] <brmbrmcar> It sounds and looks awful.
[2016/02/01 12:10:18] <brmbrmcar> It relies on indentation.
[2016/02/01 12:10:50] <mt> proper indentation > everything else :D
[2016/02/01 12:11:00] <mt> >it looks awful
[2016/02/01 12:11:06] <mt> have you seen decorators
[2016/02/01 12:11:07] <brmbrmcar> Yes, butit shouldn't affect code.
[2016/02/01 12:11:35] <mt> it should, because improper indentation will sooner or later lead to a bug because developers won't understand their code
[2016/02/01 12:12:20] <brmbrmcar> I often change indentation to what seems best.
[2016/02/01 12:13:04] <mt> 4 characters wide, spaces; what Python uses and what is best for everything
[2016/02/01 12:14:48] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I suggest to you: Brainfuck.
[2016/02/01 12:14:50] <Tobbi> It*s nice.

[2016/02/01 15:20:02] <Hume2> I hate those double letters :P
[2016/02/01 15:21:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: Because, unintuitive in Czech?
[2016/02/01 15:21:32] <Hume2> There are double letters ecen in Czech, but for some reason.
[2016/02/01 15:22:45] <Hume2> It's only when a sufix ends on the same letter as the root begins or similar situations.
[2016/02/01 15:23:01] <brmbrmcar> Sufix?
[2016/02/01 15:23:03] <brmbrmcar> LOL
[2016/02/01 15:23:10] <Hume2> Prefix
[2016/02/01 15:23:20] <Hume2> My mistake.
[2016/02/01 15:23:31] <brmbrmcar> No,the spelling of sufix.
[2016/02/01 15:24:00] <Hume2> How is it then? Suffix?
[2016/02/01 15:24:30] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/01 15:24:37] <brmbrmcar> I think.
[2016/02/01 15:25:15] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/01 15:26:22] <Hume2> Can this be a [ci skip]? I'm not sure.
[2016/02/01 15:26:29] <brmbrmcar> Wht be?
[2016/02/01 15:26:49] <Hume2> That grammar and formating fix.
[2016/02/01 15:27:06] <brmbrmcar> Is it in /src?
[2016/02/01 15:27:26] <Hume2> Yes, it is.
[2016/02/01 15:27:31] <brmbrmcar> I'd be onthe safe side.
[2016/02/01 15:28:13] <Hume2> I think so. Eventually the next build will test it.
[2016/02/01 15:29:22] <Tobbi> Hume2: It can. Just make sure it compiles locally.
[2016/02/01 15:30:15] <Tobbi> It can be expected that whatever compiled before will also compile afterwards.

[2016/02/01 15:33:29] <brmbrmcar> I was joking.
[2016/02/01 15:33:34] <Tobbi> It's okay. :P
[2016/02/01 15:33:38] <brmbrmcar> It won't fail for this.

[2016/02/01 15:49:13] <Hume2> There's a bug that noone know how to solve.
[2016/02/01 15:50:32] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2016/02/01 15:50:39] <brmbrmcar> Poor AppVeyor.
[2016/02/01 15:51:01] <Hume2> Now you can create DiscoTux :D
[2016/02/01 15:51:22] <brmbrmcar> If I had the facilities and disk space to build SuperTux.
[2016/02/01 15:51:44] <Hume2> You have spotlights, ambient light, gradients, colorful tilemaps, etc.
[2016/02/01 15:52:04] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/01 15:52:09] <Hume2> :P
[2016/02/01 15:52:45] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2016/02/01 15:53:02] <brmbrmcar> I want a proper PPA. :(

[2016/02/01 16:03:06] <brmbrmcar> s?g?
[2016/02/01 16:03:07] <Tobbi> But, disco tilemap is cool.
[2016/02/01 16:03:25] <Hume2> Thanks.

[2016/02/01 16:03:52] <Tobbi> This needs editor support, though.
[2016/02/01 16:04:02] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/01 16:04:52] <brmbrmcar> I'll look in the trees.
