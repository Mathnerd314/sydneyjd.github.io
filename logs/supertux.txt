[2015/10/11 09:34:20] <Karkus> I am creating a python script which will put a set of images into a spritesheet, then create a text file holding the coords of each sprite on the spritesheet. Then the game can read the text file, load the spritesheet and find the images easily. Is that a good way to do it?

[2015/10/11 09:47:56] <Somelauw> Not sure if bug or not, but in the level 'Into the star' reaching the secret area did not award points for reaching the secret area.
[2015/10/11 09:51:27] <Karkus> Somelauw: Is this on Antarctica?
[2015/10/11 09:54:37] <Karkus> it is.

[2015/10/11 11:10:55] <Somelauw> Karkus, yes Antarctica
[2015/10/11 11:11:03] <Somelauw> But maybe I enter it the wrong way
[2015/10/11 11:11:11] <Somelauw> There is a path above and a path below
[2015/10/11 11:11:27] <Somelauw> And if from the below path you just jump to the right, you should enter it
[2015/10/11 11:13:00] <mt> what version?
[2015/10/11 11:13:34] <Somelauw> I entered the path similar to how this guy did after 6 minutes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTWniS2jJA)
[2015/10/11 11:13:38] <Somelauw> The Windows binary
[2015/10/11 11:13:54] <mt> 0.1.3 or 0.3.5a
[2015/10/11 11:14:06] <mt> there are a few windows binaries
[2015/10/11 11:14:11] <Somelauw> 0.3.5
[2015/10/11 11:14:22] <Somelauw> 0.1.3 doesn't have secrets yet
[2015/10/11 11:14:39] <mt> did it say you found a secret area?
[2015/10/11 11:14:51] <mt> (and yes, 0.1.3 also had secret areas)
[2015/10/11 11:14:55] <Somelauw> or maybe it did. Anyway, 3.5 like that youtube video after 6 minutes
[2015/10/11 11:15:25] <Somelauw> It didn't say I found a secret area
[2015/10/11 11:15:36] <mt> well, then it doesn't count as a secret area
[2015/10/11 11:15:45] <Somelauw> so this is an unregistered secret area
[2015/10/11 11:15:54] <Somelauw> then there is another real secret one
[2015/10/11 11:17:51] <Tobbi> You most likely didn't find it ;)
[2015/10/11 11:17:56] <Tobbi> There is...
[2015/10/11 11:18:12] <Tobbi> You're close, but not close enough ;)
[2015/10/11 11:18:29] <Tobbi> Somelauw: ^^
[2015/10/11 11:37:11] <Somelauw> Okay, I tried again and concluded it must be behind that fish. However those tiny robots don't let me jump high enough to reach it.
[2015/10/11 11:38:50] <Tobbi> Somelauw: you need to be smalltux.
[2015/10/11 11:38:57] <Tobbi> Big tux is too heavy...
[2015/10/11 11:45:45] <Tobbi> We have come a long way in 5 years: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2zGhguoAyU :P
[2015/10/11 11:47:13] <Somelauw> I found the secret, but it's very mean. It threw me a 100-coin bonus which I didn't even catch.
[2015/10/11 11:47:31] <Tobbi> Somelauw: At least you did find the secret ;)
[2015/10/11 11:47:41] <Tobbi> Somelauw: Also, it's time SuperTux got a bit meaner...
[2015/10/11 11:47:47] <Tobbi> This game ain't for children anymore :P

[2015/10/11 11:51:35] <Somelauw> If I find a secret, then a checkpoint and then die, it would also forget it found the secret, so then I have to walk all the way back in the level if I want it.
[2015/10/11 11:52:38] <Somelauw> If you want him mean, give him a bazooka or something
[2015/10/11 11:53:41] <Somelauw> or some levels had clouds that were jumpable, but then in one level the cloud suddenly wasn't
[2015/10/11 11:54:04] <Somelauw> and then I died
[2015/10/11 12:01:16] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/11 12:01:29] <Tobbi> Somelauw: That's part of the game ;)
[2015/10/11 12:04:07] <Somelauw> And I really feel bad about killing female villains.
[2015/10/11 12:04:57] <Tobbi> Somelauw: You think too much...

[2015/10/11 12:38:01] <Somelauw> It seems impossible to return back to the game after alt-tabbing, so I need a restart.
[2015/10/11 12:38:44] <Somelauw> Just jumping on its head without waiting for ice thingies to fall down, so killing him at once.
[2015/10/11 12:42:54] <Tobbi> Somelauw: What version of SuperTux?
[2015/10/11 12:52:06] <Somelauw> 0.3.5
[2015/10/11 12:52:53] <Somelauw> but I didn't find the 7 coins nor the secret

[2015/10/11 15:57:21] <Tobbi> head8debian: No idea why it won't find them. Did you ask in #arch ?
[2015/10/11 15:57:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: I will if i have to...
[2015/10/11 15:59:03] <Tobbi> Actually, #archlinux is the way to go.
[2015/10/11 16:00:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: ;)
[2015/10/11 16:11:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: I have a feeling they would send me here though.
[2015/10/11 16:12:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Just try it, dammit.
[2015/10/11 16:12:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: I need to give the compututer a break though. Sore eyeballs. :p
[2015/10/11 16:12:22] <Tobbi> afaik, it works in every other linux distro.
[2015/10/11 16:12:37] <head8debian> That we have tested.
[2015/10/11 16:12:52] <head8debian> And Supertux 0.3.5a is in the repos, so i figure its there.
[2015/10/11 16:14:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, but please just ask them. We can implement any code changes they find.

[2015/10/11 16:27:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, but not today...
[2015/10/11 16:27:56] <Karkus> okay
[2015/10/11 16:28:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: What distro are you running, once again?
[2015/10/11 16:28:15] <Karkus> Linux Mint
[2015/10/11 16:28:20] <Tobbi> ah okay...
[2015/10/11 16:28:40] <Tobbi> Hmm, I don't want to create yet another VM to just test this one bug...
[2015/10/11 16:28:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: Go on...
[2015/10/11 16:29:06] <Tobbi> Karkus: Huh? I said "I don't".
[2015/10/11 16:29:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: I mean what's the bug?
[2015/10/11 16:29:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: It doesn't find openal dependencies on Arch Linux.
[2015/10/11 16:30:06] <Tobbi> Not sure if it's our problem or Linux Mint's.
[2015/10/11 16:30:16] <Tobbi> But head8debian is running Arch, so he is asking in #archlinux.
[2015/10/11 16:30:26] <Karkus> Ah okay. That makes sense
[2015/10/11 16:31:42] <Tobbi> haha "Or Linux Mint's" haha...
[2015/10/11 16:31:52] <Tobbi> Means i probably should go to bed.
[2015/10/11 16:32:01] <Karkus> I knew what you mean

[2015/10/11 16:32:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: What is our work?

[2015/10/11 16:34:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: Can you run that pkgbuild file directly?
[2015/10/11 16:35:01] <Karkus> head8debian: why not head8arch ?
[2015/10/11 16:35:06] <Tobbi> Also, if it doesn't work, tell them that....?
[2015/10/11 16:35:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: GOod idea. Arch is handy in this way.
[2015/10/11 16:35:29] <head8debian> :D
[2015/10/11 16:38:11] <head8debian> Tobbi: If this works its my fault, if it doesnt arch has issues.

[2015/10/11 17:06:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: run the interpreter and then type help('modules'). If you see 'PIL' then it's installed
[2015/10/11 17:06:25] <Tobbi> Of course it's not in version control :D
[2015/10/11 17:06:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im stuck on  mergign the patch. ;)
[2015/10/11 17:06:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: You can use patch --help

[2015/10/11 17:07:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh
[2015/10/11 17:08:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's odd, it was for me.
[2015/10/11 17:08:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: I installed using macports or homebrew, not sure which
[2015/10/11 17:08:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Might be the problem
[2015/10/11 17:09:05] <Karkus> I'll see if it's listed online
[2015/10/11 17:10:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: Which problem?
[2015/10/11 17:11:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'm using PIL to get the images into the spritesheet
[2015/10/11 17:11:36] <Tobbi> Ah!
[2015/10/11 17:11:39] <Tobbi> No problem, I can install it.
[2015/10/11 17:12:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: There, its working...

[2015/10/11 17:13:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: You were trying to patch the patch file with the original file that wasn't a patch?
[2015/10/11 17:14:03] <Tobbi> Now I'm the one who's confused...
[2015/10/11 17:14:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: I had the file names in the wrong spots...

[2015/10/12 09:34:51] <leyyin> *Does the link work?

[2015/10/12 09:35:09] <leyyin> head8debian, you are welcome :P
[2015/10/12 09:35:55] <head8debian> leyyin: My fingers are not working properly today it seems...
[2015/10/12 09:38:24] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yes it does.
[2015/10/12 09:38:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: That makes it hard doing...certain things...
[2015/10/12 09:38:56] <Tobbi> leyyin: I believe time will tell whether you drop that ass-holy attitude or not.
[2015/10/12 09:42:16] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/10/12 09:49:33] <leyyin> yes, I am an asshole
[2015/10/12 09:49:38] <leyyin> that is well established
[2015/10/12 09:49:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't prefer aptitude over apt... but i like pacman. :D
[2015/10/12 09:49:55] <head8debian>  /clear...
[2015/10/12 09:50:03] <leyyin> aptitude search <name>
[2015/10/12 09:50:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: I can cope with that.
[2015/10/12 09:50:42] <Tobbi> leyyin: To be honest, I have met worse people than you. but don't take that as a compliment.
[2015/10/12 09:50:50] <leyyin> aww, thanks
[2015/10/12 09:51:08] <Tobbi> leyyin: DON'T take that as a compliment.
[2015/10/12 09:51:17] <leyyin> thanks Tobbi, you so sweet
[2015/10/12 09:51:24] <Tobbi> leyyin: Fuck you!
[2015/10/12 09:51:32] <head8debian> leyyin: Hehe, Tobbi is in a good mood... :p
[2015/10/12 09:51:39] <leyyin> yes :D
[2015/10/12 09:51:45] @ head8debian left channel #supertux ("ok, im leaving...")
[2015/10/12 09:51:45] * leyyin pats Tobbi
[2015/10/12 09:52:02] * leyyin awaits for kick
[2015/10/12 09:52:11] * Tobbi kills leyyin in a very violent way.
[2015/10/12 09:52:18] <Tobbi> SOmething that takes long and is painful.
[2015/10/12 09:54:11] <Tobbi> yes! finally! building supertuxkart works again.
[2015/10/12 09:54:17] <Tobbi> I believe.
[2015/10/12 09:56:00] <Tobbi> leyyin: Did I really make head8debian leave by using the f word?
[2015/10/12 09:56:11] <leyyin> idk
[2015/10/12 09:56:44] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes, I did.
[2015/10/12 09:57:14] <leyyin> well now you know what to say if you want him to leave :P
[2015/10/12 09:57:19] <Tobbi> leyyin: Good point.
[2015/10/12 09:57:22] * Tobbi takes a mental note.
[2015/10/12 09:58:11] <Tobbi> leyyin: STK is x86 only, right? Because I tried building it with the normal curl deps and it failed.
[2015/10/12 09:58:17] <Tobbi> I had to use the universal port of curl.
[2015/10/12 09:58:36] <leyyin> on windows it may be only x86
[2015/10/12 09:58:41] <Tobbi> leyyin: mac.
[2015/10/12 09:58:46] <leyyin> not on linux thought
[2015/10/12 09:58:47] <Tobbi> Maybe I just don't know how to use dependencies.
[2015/10/12 09:58:55] <Tobbi> Doesn't matter, anyway.
[2015/10/12 09:58:59] <Tobbi> Seems to be fine with universal curl.
[2015/10/12 10:00:27] @ head8debian joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/12 10:00:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: STK is 64bit on linux.
[2015/10/12 10:00:59] <head8debian> Well, both 32 bit and 64 bit.
[2015/10/12 10:01:12] <leyyin> head8debian, you watch the bot logs?
[2015/10/12 10:01:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: of course he does.
[2015/10/12 10:01:20] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/12 10:01:42] <Tobbi> That's at least what I would do in case I pretend to rage-quit :P
[2015/10/12 10:01:49] <Tobbi> And I regularly do for mozilla channels.
[2015/10/12 10:01:55] <Tobbi> But people don't mention me there any longer :D
[2015/10/12 10:02:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: Only 32 bit for Mac and Windows.
[2015/10/12 10:02:30] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, makes sense.
[2015/10/12 10:02:50] <Tobbi> Why the hell did macports install the x64 variant in the first place. I didn't change anything.
[2015/10/12 10:02:51] <head8debian> leyyin: There is a few of me sitting in here... ;)
[2015/10/12 10:03:05] <Tobbi> m_t your evil clone?
[2015/10/12 10:03:06] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/12 10:03:23] <red_bot> Mwhahahaha
[2015/10/12 10:03:32] <Tobbi> Yeah, that as well.
[2015/10/12 10:05:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: But TSC 0.9.1 and newer is too much of a GPU hog for me...
[2015/10/12 10:06:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: TSC? You mean STK?
[2015/10/12 10:06:19] <Tobbi> woo, building finished.
[2015/10/12 10:06:21] <Tobbi> let's see...
[2015/10/12 10:06:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: One of those names.
[2015/10/12 10:06:57] <head8debian> I hate chromium... no propper flash support, and no proper java support.
[2015/10/12 10:07:36] <head8debian> ANd my school uses java. i hate java.
[2015/10/12 10:07:42] <head8debian> Well, no directly.
[2015/10/12 10:07:51] <head8debian> mainly their windows isntaller.
[2015/10/12 10:08:14] <head8debian> installer*
[2015/10/12 10:08:24] <leyyin> head8debian, so close
[2015/10/12 10:08:57] <head8debian> leyyin: fingers...
[2015/10/12 10:10:53] <leyyin> feet...
[2015/10/12 10:11:29] <leyyin> head8debian, you should not use flash and java anyway
[2015/10/12 10:11:38] <leyyin> on the web
[2015/10/12 10:11:45] <head8debian> leyyin: I cannot help it.
[2015/10/12 10:11:59] <head8debian> leyyin: If you will buy me school books i wont. :D
[2015/10/12 10:12:18] <leyyin> isn't school free?
[2015/10/12 10:12:26] <head8debian> Nothing free...
[2015/10/12 10:12:30] <head8debian> Nothings*
[2015/10/12 10:12:39] <head8debian> leyyin: Im homeschooled...
[2015/10/12 10:13:06] <leyyin> weird murica :P
[2015/10/12 10:13:28] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/10/12 10:17:29] <Tobbi> indeed.
[2015/10/12 10:18:30] <Tobbi> Is homeschooling cheaper or more expensive than regular schooling?
[2015/10/12 10:19:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: More expensive since you have to pay for everything on top of paying for normal school through taxes.
[2015/10/12 10:20:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: Aren't you anywhere near a school or what's the motivation behind this? In germany, schooling is generally paid for by the government. Even university education.
[2015/10/12 10:20:32] <leyyin> Tobbi, thanks EU for not having 400k university debt :P
[2015/10/12 10:20:35] <leyyin> 0 debt baby
[2015/10/12 10:20:41] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yup! :)
[2015/10/12 10:21:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: Even though some states used to have college education fees. But luckily, my state Schleswig-Holstein waved those very early on.
[2015/10/12 10:21:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Because alot of people dont like whats being tought in schools today...
[2015/10/12 10:21:33] <Tobbi> head8debian: For example?
[2015/10/12 10:21:39] <head8debian> And what schools enforce.
[2015/10/12 10:21:43] <leyyin> creating your own bubble is kinda bad tbh
[2015/10/12 10:21:51] <leyyin> head8debian, highschools are assholes :P
[2015/10/12 10:22:02] <head8debian> I have no clue what that means.
[2015/10/12 10:22:03] <leyyin> I was in an highschool with uniforms
[2015/10/12 10:22:12] <Tobbi> leyyin: I was in highschool and got bullied.
[2015/10/12 10:22:15] <leyyin> gate closed at 8 am sharp, stupid guardians
[2015/10/12 10:22:18] <Tobbi> Very severely.
[2015/10/12 10:22:29] <leyyin> it was like a prison
[2015/10/12 10:22:30] <Tobbi> There were times when I fought back, physically...
[2015/10/12 10:22:36] <Tobbi> I didn't like the teachers.
[2015/10/12 10:22:42] <head8debian> What fun. :D
[2015/10/12 10:22:54] <head8debian> And you ask why we dont go to school...
[2015/10/12 10:23:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, what do regular schools want to teach you that you don't like?
[2015/10/12 10:23:12] <leyyin> yes, but it teaches you how to work in a pack
[2015/10/12 10:23:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: I wouldnt be here if i wasn't homeschooled. ;)
[2015/10/12 10:23:37] <Tobbi> that doesn't answer my question
[2015/10/12 10:23:58] <Tobbi> leyyin: Highschools have taught me to disregard everything superiors tell me :)
[2015/10/12 10:24:07] <Tobbi> And see! It works!
[2015/10/12 10:24:09] <leyyin> that too :P
[2015/10/12 10:24:42] <leyyin> I always thought bullying is weird west phenomenon
[2015/10/12 10:24:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, evolution, that it doesnt matter what we do, that we have no calling in life and we are jsut arandom blob that came from nothing and has no meaning. THat its ok to disreguard everything we are told, its ok to live and eat but not ever work, its ok to sit on our phones 24/7 talking to other people about random stuff that has no meaning, etc.
[2015/10/12 10:25:18] <leyyin> evolution does not tell you any of that ;)
[2015/10/12 10:25:19] <Tobbi> hm.
[2015/10/12 10:25:30] <leyyin> that is your interpretation
[2015/10/12 10:25:40] <Tobbi> If I sit on my phone 24/7, the phone will be flat like a pancake.
[2015/10/12 10:25:41] <leyyin> evolution is just facts about how organism evolve
[2015/10/12 10:26:04] <Tobbi> or broken.
[2015/10/12 10:26:12] <Tobbi> I guess I should possibly not comment on that.
[2015/10/12 10:26:20] * leyyin starts flame war
[2015/10/12 10:26:31] <Tobbi> leyyin: Don't. I am trying to keep things civil...
[2015/10/12 10:26:33] <head8debian> And that its ok to have sex before your married, its ok to have a girlfriend when you are 8, its ok for 2 people of the same gender to live together, or oposite gender.
[2015/10/12 10:26:52] <leyyin> ah the future :D
[2015/10/12 10:26:56] <leyyin> I like it tbh
[2015/10/12 10:27:23] <head8debian> Evolution is a theory... And it has yet to be proven in our current time frame...
[2015/10/12 10:27:40] <leyyin> head8debian, gravity is a theory too
[2015/10/12 10:27:48] <leyyin> scientific theory
[2015/10/12 10:27:48] <head8debian> s/proven/reproduced/
[2015/10/12 10:27:48] <red_bot> head8debian meant: "Evolution is a theory... And it has yet to be reproduced in our current time frame..."
[2015/10/12 10:28:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: Let's assume both things are equally true?
[2015/10/12 10:28:11] <head8debian> Yes, but it is something we can prove, and happens as we speak.
[2015/10/12 10:28:32] <leyyin> you can believe whatever you like, but what you believe does not make it true :P
[2015/10/12 10:28:49] <Tobbi> head8debian: Assuming (a) god, in whatever form that might be created "evolution" (in whatever form that might be).
[2015/10/12 10:28:59] <Tobbi> Okay?
[2015/10/12 10:29:03] <head8debian> ...
[2015/10/12 10:29:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am quite serious.
[2015/10/12 10:29:10] <leyyin> some christians a I know believe in evolution, so it depends
[2015/10/12 10:30:07] <head8debian> leyyin: Yes, and when they do, they pretty much are saying that i belive the bible *except* for this one book and all these other verses... which does not work.
[2015/10/12 10:30:22] <leyyin> head8debian, modern christians are all cherry picking, lets be honest
[2015/10/12 10:30:33] <head8debian> Precisely!
[2015/10/12 10:30:42] <leyyin> if you were not, you will be like ISIS :P
[2015/10/12 10:32:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, what about that: Let's just assume there's a truth to what you believe as well as what leyyin believes to be true?
[2015/10/12 10:32:24] <Tobbi> And we can all get along nicely.
[2015/10/12 10:32:45] <leyyin> I do not believe, I just state the scientific facts of evolution :P
[2015/10/12 10:33:10] <leyyin> anyway, this discussion if pointless
[2015/10/12 10:33:11] <head8debian> You either belive the Bible to its entirity, or not at all. I believe the earth was created in 6 days as it says. I belive we were created in God's image. I also belive though that we have had genetic weaknesses passed down because of our behavior. Not because of God or evolution though, but because of our own doings.
[2015/10/12 10:33:30] <leyyin> to each his own
[2015/10/12 10:34:39] <head8debian> And i will call that a close to this convorsation. ;)
[2015/10/12 10:35:20] <Tobbi> Good.
[2015/10/12 10:35:26] <Tobbi> Let's get back to business.
[2015/10/12 10:35:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: Which is? :p
[2015/10/12 10:35:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: What is this channel about, again?
[2015/10/12 10:36:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: it was a joke...
[2015/10/12 10:36:11] <leyyin> evolution vs religion
[2015/10/12 10:36:13] * leyyin runs
[2015/10/12 10:36:14] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/10/12 10:41:07] <leyyin> head8debian, you should visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic#Religion :P
[2015/10/12 10:41:40] <head8debian> leyyin: I have school to do...
[2015/10/12 10:41:49] <leyyin> you are on IRC :D
[2015/10/12 10:42:31] <head8debian> leyyin: I am *always* on irc...
[2015/10/12 10:42:43] <head8debian> :p
[2015/10/12 10:44:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: I hope you're not too heavy, otherwise IRC might not like it that much.
[2015/10/12 10:45:47] * head8debian wonders when Tobbi will stop making bad jokes and pput his energy toward something usefull...
[2015/10/12 10:45:50] <head8debian> ;P
[2015/10/12 10:45:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: Like college stuff?
[2015/10/12 10:46:05] <head8debian> Yeah.
[2015/10/12 10:46:11] <Tobbi> Soon, I guess.
[2015/10/12 10:46:15] <Tobbi> I still have stuff to do.
[2015/10/12 10:46:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: If you have nothing else to do you can install arch and test my package. :D
[2015/10/12 10:47:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: No thanks.
[2015/10/12 10:47:11] <Tobbi> Not at this time.
[2015/10/12 10:47:16] <Tobbi> I need to get drunk before I start that.
[2015/10/12 10:47:17] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/12 10:47:48] <head8debian> So you can overwrite your whole HDD? :p
[2015/10/12 10:48:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, it's a ZIP bomb, that package?
[2015/10/12 10:48:34] <head8debian> its a .pkg.tar.xz.
[2015/10/12 10:48:42] <Tobbi> XZ bomb, then.
[2015/10/12 10:48:47] <head8debian> the .pkg tells pacman that its a package.
[2015/10/12 10:49:18] <head8debian> pacman is your package manager.
[2015/10/12 10:49:29] <head8debian> He bites if you do something wrong. :D
[2015/10/12 10:51:02] <Tobbi> okay, whatever.
[2015/10/12 10:51:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: No, he really does. Its a trick package management system that is rolling-release.
[2015/10/12 10:51:42] <head8debian> tricky*
[2015/10/12 10:52:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: "pacman or treat"?
[2015/10/12 10:53:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: ?
[2015/10/12 10:53:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: never mind.
[2015/10/12 10:54:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman
[2015/10/12 10:54:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: *sigh* I know.
[2015/10/12 10:55:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sould i switch my nick to arch8debian? :p
[2015/10/12 10:55:49] <Tobbi> head8arch
[2015/10/12 10:55:55] <head8debian> lol, i didnt notice arch ate debian...

[2015/10/12 17:10:41] <Karkus> take a look if you like :)
[2015/10/12 17:11:54] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could actually use that to merge all the font files, right? And then alter the font loading code so that it loads the correct glyphs?
[2015/10/12 17:12:21] <Karkus> Err. Why would we do that? How many font files are there?
[2015/10/12 17:14:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: because currently, these font files are loaded a thousand times, iirc.
[2015/10/12 17:14:54] <Tobbi> If I looked correctly.
[2015/10/12 17:14:58] <Tobbi> Let me have a look again.
[2015/10/12 17:15:35] <Tobbi> Sorry, I am currently rather busy with my android development...
[2015/10/12 17:15:43] <Tobbi> Can we continue this tomorrow?

[2015/10/12 17:18:16] <Tobbi> Thanks.
[2015/10/12 17:18:24] <Tobbi> My android app is a nightmare on its own.
[2015/10/12 17:18:48] <Karkus> What is the app? What are you developing it for?
[2015/10/12 17:19:28] <Karkus> Just wondering :P
[2015/10/12 17:20:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's a navigation app for my college.
[2015/10/12 17:20:26] <Tobbi> With BroadcastReceivers and stuff...
[2015/10/12 17:21:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Sounds... interesting?
[2015/10/12 17:21:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: http://screencast.com/t/XDLmAoW9R
[2015/10/12 17:21:36] <Tobbi> Normally, there's a map in the background.
[2015/10/12 17:21:44] <Tobbi> Which doesn't work because it's inside Android Simulator...
[2015/10/12 17:22:19] <Tobbi> And I just spend days frustrated until someone in #android-dev told me that fragments inside fragments using XML is not possible.
[2015/10/12 17:22:34] <Tobbi> So, I had to create things programmatically.
[2015/10/12 17:23:55] <Tobbi> And I believe, I will try it out now for real...
[2015/10/12 17:24:06] @ Quit: bb010g: Ping timeout: 264 seconds
[2015/10/12 17:27:29] <Karkus> Right. :P
[2015/10/12 17:28:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: In the meantime I will try to incorporate it into the actual game
[2015/10/12 17:28:28] <Tobbi> Karkus: Thanks!
[2015/10/12 17:28:32] <Tobbi> See you later.

[2015/10/12 17:47:10] <Tobbi> Finally!
[2015/10/12 17:47:17] <Karkus> Yay!
[2015/10/12 17:47:26] <Tobbi> It finally updates the position automatically.
[2015/10/12 17:48:12] <Karkus> Is 76 seconds too long to take creating the spritesheet?
[2015/10/12 17:49:11] @ tux|dude joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/12 17:50:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: Doubt it.
[2015/10/12 17:50:42] <Tobbi> We won't be using it all the time.
[2015/10/12 17:52:33] <Karkus> What it's gonna do is 'imitate' the file structure so you can access images by the same path as usual, but whatever loads the sprites will hide the fact that there is no such file structure and get the file from the spritesheet
[2015/10/12 17:52:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: Sounds good.
[2015/10/12 17:53:17] <Tobbi> We should, however, make sure to move the previous images to the media repository so that they don't get lost.
[2015/10/12 17:53:23] <Tobbi> Okay?
[2015/10/12 17:54:03] <Karkus> They wont be removed; they will not be included in the release though.
[2015/10/12 17:54:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: sounds good.
[2015/10/12 17:54:54] <Karkus> So for now we stick to normal images, but maybe when I've got it working and if we see a performance increase then before each build we can run this script
[2015/10/12 17:55:17] <Tobbi> Karkus: Before each build is a little excessive.
[2015/10/12 17:55:24] <Tobbi> Only when images are changed, I believe.
[2015/10/12 17:55:40] <Karkus> Tobbi: Argh, my wording. I meant release
[2015/10/12 17:55:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: Ah, yeah, of course.
[2015/10/12 17:56:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: As spritesheets are far more ugly to fiddle with on a single texture basis
[2015/10/12 17:56:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually...https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/Import-from-Image
[2015/10/12 17:58:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: Can it handle various sprite sizes?
[2015/10/12 17:58:30] <Tobbi> I am not sure...I haven't used it excessively.
[2015/10/12 17:59:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: You can try it out from http://www.mapeditor.org/
[2015/10/12 17:59:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: I have used tiled before...
[2015/10/12 17:59:33] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/10/12 18:00:33] <Karkus> We *could* create a plugin for TilED to use as the editor in theory
[2015/10/12 18:00:42] <Karkus> But then the flexlay editor...
[2015/10/12 18:00:55] <Karkus> And it would just be even more work
[2015/10/12 18:01:41] <Tobbi> Karkus: We need a custom editor, SuperTux is more than just tiles.
[2015/10/12 18:02:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: That wouldn't be the problem; Tiled can handle objects. In theory it's a good idea, but I thing flexlay will work.
[2015/10/12 18:03:02] <Tobbi> OK.
[2015/10/12 18:03:04] <Karkus> s/thing/think/
[2015/10/12 18:03:04] <red_bot> Karkus meant: "Tobbi: That wouldn't be the problem; Tiled can handle objects. In theory it's a good idea, but I think flexlay will work."
[2015/10/12 18:03:20] <Tobbi> I didn't even notice that until you pointed it out :D
[2015/10/12 18:03:59] <Karkus> Flexlay will be easier to work with as it already cooperates well with supertux
[2015/10/12 18:04:28] <Tobbi> yeah...
[2015/10/12 18:04:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Perfection is key. Programming languages don't like spelling mistakes

[2015/10/13 10:11:13] <head8debian> Tobbi: And i still havent gotten supertux to build.
[2015/10/13 10:11:21] <Tobbi> head8debian: I thought you had?

[2015/10/13 11:52:44] <Karkus> Did you get the Python editor working btw?

[2015/10/13 11:56:48] <head8debian> Karkus: I got the old editor.
[2015/10/13 11:56:52] <head8debian> Not the python one.
[2015/10/13 11:57:04] <Karkus> Oh, I see.
[2015/10/13 11:57:15] <Karkus> With mono?
[2015/10/13 11:57:20] <head8debian> Yes.
[2015/10/13 11:57:36] <head8debian> I jsut switched to Arch, so im trying to get everything switched over. ;)
[2015/10/13 11:58:48] <Karkus> What did you switch from?
[2015/10/13 11:58:51] <Karkus> Debian?
[2015/10/13 12:00:57] <head8debian> Yes.
[2015/10/13 12:01:04] <head8debian> I still run debian though.
[2015/10/13 12:04:18] <head8debian> Must be something wrong with my local git version. I just cloned and it built fine.
[2015/10/13 12:04:22] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/10/13 12:06:18] <Karkus> odd
[2015/10/13 12:13:17] <head8debian> Anyways...
[2015/10/13 12:13:33] <head8debian> Karkus: Do you know what Tobbi wanted me to do with the old worldmap?
[2015/10/13 12:13:51] <Karkus> Old Worldmap? You mean Antarctica?
[2015/10/13 12:13:58] <Karkus> head8debian:^
[2015/10/13 12:16:14] <head8debian> Karkus: I didnt mean to drop in the word 'old'... ;)
[2015/10/13 12:16:23] <head8debian> Im not sure what worldmap he wants.
[2015/10/13 12:16:35] <head8debian> My brain was elsewhere... ;)
[2015/10/13 12:19:39] <Karkus> head8debian: Idk what he wants, but I know that the level files in the forest world need renaming ('christoph2.stl' is not very helpful) and some levels need redoing.

[2015/10/14 13:38:28] <leper`> be grateful that he's not working in a bakery
[2015/10/14 13:38:54] <Tobbi_> leper`, I said "pun" not "bun"
[2015/10/14 13:39:21] <leper`> I said "not"
[2015/10/14 13:39:29] <Tobbi_> Right.
[2015/10/14 13:40:02] <leyyin> how 0 AD people are here
[2015/10/14 13:40:07] <leyyin> *wow

[2015/10/14 13:43:07] <Tobbi_> leper`, You're German?
[2015/10/14 13:43:12] <leper`> no
[2015/10/14 13:43:20] <leyyin> leprosy hmmm
[2015/10/14 13:43:24] <Tobbi_> ...but?
[2015/10/14 13:43:37] <leyyin> Tobbi_, only german people speak german?
[2015/10/14 13:43:53] <Tobbi_> leyyin, Yes.
[2015/10/14 13:44:09] <Tobbi_> leyyin, Foreigners don't speak "German". Even Bavarians don't.
[2015/10/14 13:44:14] <leyyin> If I speak English i'm British? ;)
[2015/10/14 13:44:21] <leyyin> Tobbi_, right :P
[2015/10/14 13:44:24] <Tobbi_> leyyin, You are.
[2015/10/14 13:45:13] <leper`> leyyin: since you can't get that capital I right I think you're one of those colonists
[2015/10/14 13:45:52] <Tobbi_> :D
[2015/10/14 13:45:56] <Tobbi_> Okay, let's stop this.
[2015/10/14 13:46:05] <Tobbi_> I really need a break from studying.
[2015/10/14 13:46:11] <Tobbi_> I can't stand it any longer.
[2015/10/14 13:46:21] <leper`> You're studying irc conversations?
[2015/10/14 13:46:35] <Tobbi_> leper`, No, this was rather off-topic...
[2015/10/14 13:46:38] <Tobbi_> I meant in general.
[2015/10/14 13:46:56] <leper`> ah, had that problem earlier today
[2015/10/14 13:47:02] <leper`> solved it by taking a nap
[2015/10/14 13:47:16] <Tobbi_> Doubt this is gonna help me this time.
[2015/10/14 13:47:23] <Tobbi_> I don't like my masters. But, damn, I want a masters...
[2015/10/14 13:48:00] <leper`> Do you have people asking whether and or or binds stronger?
[2015/10/14 13:48:29] <Tobbi_> leper`, Kind of?
[2015/10/14 13:48:51] <Tobbi_> No, it's basically because EVERYONE seems to be nerdy. And I can't stand that. I like to have normal conversation topics.
[2015/10/14 13:48:58] <leyyin> Tobbi_, so you do not like your masters but you want one :P
[2015/10/14 13:49:07] <Tobbi_> leyyin, I want to have this damn degree.
[2015/10/14 13:49:13] <leyyin> that you hate?
[2015/10/14 13:49:28] <Tobbi_> leyyin, I hate the course. I want the certificate.
[2015/10/14 13:49:29] <leper`> ah, did you try having conversations about topics that are totally nuts?
[2015/10/14 13:49:47] <Tobbi_> leper`, Maybe I just don't like the people...
[2015/10/14 13:50:03] <Tobbi_> And thus I don't even get the incentive to start a proper thing.
[2015/10/14 13:51:18] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/14 13:52:08] <Tobbi_> I mean start talking to the people about normal things.
[2015/10/14 13:54:20] <leper`> hm, find some people elsewhere to talk to
[2015/10/14 13:55:37] <Tobbi_> leper`, I will try. But I'm more inclined to quit studying.
[2015/10/14 13:55:47] <Tobbi_> And fince another area that might be more fun.
[2015/10/14 13:55:58] <leyyin> hiking
[2015/10/14 13:56:14] <Tobbi_> leyyin, Yeah...doesn't get me much money, though.
[2015/10/14 13:56:34] <Tobbi_> I really need half a year vacation or something...

[2015/10/14 17:02:00] <Tobbi> I mean: Supertux has gotten some momentum from outside.
[2015/10/14 17:02:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Maybe we will have to pay datahead8888. :p
[2015/10/14 17:02:32] <head8debian> Maybe we will just retire the whole program after 2.0
[2015/10/14 17:02:52] <Tobbi> head8debian, That would be fun.
[2015/10/14 17:02:52] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/10/14 17:03:04] <head8debian> Let someone else take over.
[2015/10/14 17:03:15] <head8debian> Or maybe Hume could step up. ;)
[2015/10/14 17:03:40] <Tobbi> head8debian, sarcasm?
[2015/10/14 17:03:46] <head8debian> It would be interesting to see where a project like this would go if he had his hands on it.
[2015/10/14 17:03:50] <head8debian> No.
[2015/10/14 17:04:11] <Tobbi> head8debian, "interesting" for sure.
[2015/10/14 17:04:16] <head8debian> hehe.
[2015/10/14 17:04:30] <Tobbi> But actually, he has changed...so maybe it wouldn't be that much of a problem.
[2015/10/14 17:04:32] <head8debian> Well, i am afk...
[2015/10/14 17:04:42] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/10/14 17:09:04] <datahead8888> You could always try crowdfunding if you want to pay people
[2015/10/14 17:09:40] <Tobbi> datahead8888, I have the feeling people are just not interested in SuperTux....
[2015/10/14 17:09:57] <datahead8888> We've talked about it for Secret Chronicles before.  The feelings were a bit mixed, though I think it could bring benefits.
[2015/10/14 17:10:29] <datahead8888> Also, why are commercial video games devleopers the only ones who can make a living off of game development?  Why can't open source'ers do the same?
[2015/10/14 17:10:52] <datahead8888> Tobbi, that's a problem with volunteer only open source development - if no one finds time, the project dies
[2015/10/14 17:11:02] <datahead8888> People have greater priorities with their day jobs and families
[2015/10/14 17:11:15] <datahead8888> And, after all that, they get tired and want to watch some TV or something
[2015/10/14 17:11:15] <Tobbi> datahead8888, I don't have either. And I hate it.
[2015/10/14 17:11:31] <Tobbi> And I'm not happy about my life in general.
[2015/10/14 17:11:43] <datahead8888> I'm sorry to hear that
[2015/10/14 17:12:14] <Tobbi> I have fought for my studies for so long...and I'm so burnt out...and there are no people in my cs class I like to talk to.
[2015/10/14 17:12:28] <Tobbi> I believe I need a break.
[2015/10/14 17:13:01] <Tobbi> Know what? Screw this.

[2015/10/15 10:15:09] <head8debian> I didn't realize it was a whole scripting language...

[2015/10/15 10:15:31] <head8debian> Im sure i can.Just thought you might want to be a teacher. :D
[2015/10/15 10:15:49] <head8debian> I mean, i thought it was a simpler scripting language for just websites...
[2015/10/15 10:15:57] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, not at the moment. i'm trying to take a slower pace at things.
[2015/10/15 10:16:14] <Tobbi> I am burning out.

[2015/10/15 10:19:22] <Tobbi> I want to achieve more.
[2015/10/15 10:19:39] <head8debian> hmph
[2015/10/15 10:20:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do you really think I'll be happy later in life when I found out that only achieved a Bachelors degree and everyone else achieved more? They'll look down on me.
[2015/10/15 10:21:06] <head8debian> I honestly dont know. But why are you caring what other think? Its *your* life.
[2015/10/15 10:21:25] <Tobbi> head8debian: You might be right...
[2015/10/15 10:21:30] <Tobbi> Actually, you are right...
[2015/10/15 10:21:56] <Tobbi> But still...this is not how I want my life to be? Sitting in front of the PC the whole day...
[2015/10/15 10:23:03] <Tobbi> So, yeah, I'll take a step back.
[2015/10/15 10:23:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, sitting in front of it *all* day is alot...

[2015/10/15 10:30:30] <Tobbi> HTML / CSS is boring.

[2015/10/15 10:46:00] <Tobbi> C++ is hard.
[2015/10/15 10:47:28] <Mathnerd314> my path was Java -> Assembly -> C++ -> Haskell -> Javascript

[2015/10/15 10:48:09] <Tobbi> Haskell...don't know anything about haskell.
[2015/10/15 10:48:16] <Mathnerd314> it made sense at the time, Java is a virtual machine, so I wanted to see what a real machine did

[2015/10/15 10:50:49] <Mathnerd314> Tobbi: yeah. High-frequency trading, the occasional website, Facebook's spam filter, a few other things.
[2015/10/15 10:51:00] <Tobbi> Ah, okay...
[2015/10/15 10:51:26] <Mathnerd314> they get asked so often they have a wiki page: https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_industry
[2015/10/15 10:57:45] <head8debian> I jsut want to learn javascript for websites! Thats it!
[2015/10/15 10:57:59] <head8debian> Arg. ;p
[2015/10/15 10:59:36] <Mathnerd314> head8debian: that's insufficient. any real web developer also has to write backend stuff, like database integration. if you don't know any of that you're just a designer, and a poor one since you don't know what can actually be implemented

[2015/10/15 11:25:46] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: I did.

[2015/10/15 11:26:46] <Mathnerd314> just seems like a lot of work with no clear payoff
[2015/10/15 11:27:22] <Mathnerd314> like if someone said "I resurfaced my garage over the summer"
[2015/10/15 11:27:51] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: The payoff was incredible. But I had trouble with the culture...
[2015/10/15 11:28:05] <Mathnerd314> like seriously, who does this: http://www.cincinnati-concrete-resurfacing.com/images/garagedurafleck1.jpg :-)
[2015/10/15 11:28:17] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/15 11:28:51] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: Even Google contacted me 5 months ago asking me whether I'd like a job. (Un)fortunately, I didn't even get to the interview rounds.

[2015/10/15 11:32:30] <head8debian> No i don't/
[2015/10/15 11:32:34] <Tobbi> It's not too hard, just make sure they get to remember you.
[2015/10/15 11:32:45] <head8debian> Since they probably expect top of the line coders.
[2015/10/15 11:32:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Am I a top of the line coder?
[2015/10/15 11:33:02] <head8debian> Not someone who can do nothing.
[2015/10/15 11:33:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes. :D
[2015/10/15 11:33:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: *sigh*
[2015/10/15 11:33:12] <head8debian> What you do works. :D
[2015/10/15 11:33:13] <Tobbi> I am not…
[2015/10/15 11:33:24] <Tobbi> Ah ……
[2015/10/15 11:33:31] <Tobbi> Didn't know that existed…
[2015/10/15 11:34:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's just a matter of practice.
[2015/10/15 11:34:10] <head8debian> Way to many periods... :p
[2015/10/15 11:34:12] <head8debian> And why are your periods so close?
[2015/10/15 11:34:31] <head8debian> I dont know what i want to do...
[2015/10/15 11:36:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: Seriously. I'm insignificant. I don't know anything...
[2015/10/15 11:36:17] <Tobbi> I'm a loser in life and please don't become like me.
[2015/10/15 11:36:31] <Tobbi> I barely got a Bachelor's degree...and I'm even struggling with a Masters....
[2015/10/15 11:36:52] <Tobbi> A lot of my friends already have a masters or go forward studying for a Doctoral degree...
[2015/10/15 11:36:52] <Mathnerd314> head8debian: you should pick a better role model, like me. :-)
[2015/10/15 11:37:04] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: ...
[2015/10/15 11:37:38] <Tobbi> Role models are bad anyway...
[2015/10/15 11:38:29] <Mathnerd314> they've done studies, people actually use people around them unconsciously as role models
[2015/10/15 11:38:43] <Tobbi> No one does for me.
[2015/10/15 11:38:49] <Tobbi> No one wants me as their role model.
[2015/10/15 11:39:38] <Mathnerd314> you wouldn't be able to tell, probably
[2015/10/15 11:39:52] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: No one knows me :D
[2015/10/15 11:40:05] <Tobbi> I have zero friends.
[2015/10/15 11:40:10] <Tobbi> There are no people...
[2015/10/15 11:40:17] <Tobbi> People are an illusion anyway...
[2015/10/15 11:40:53] <Mathnerd314> you mean random people on IRC aren't your friends? :O
[2015/10/15 11:41:52] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: We Germans have different levels of "friends".
[2015/10/15 11:42:29] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: No, besides...I was having a few drinks with some of my profs...All I hear is them talking about a fellow student of mine who managed to get a bachelors degree due to his persistence.
[2015/10/15 11:42:33] <Tobbi> No one talks about me or my achievements.
[2015/10/15 11:42:45] <Tobbi> Despite Mozilla shit and despite me coming from a lower class background.
[2015/10/15 11:43:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: We all could say the same thing...
[2015/10/15 11:43:13] <Hume2> Tobbi: not really, I talk about you with Narre.
[2015/10/15 11:43:13] <Tobbi> One of my profs even hates me. And believe me, I can tell.
[2015/10/15 11:43:30] <Tobbi> Literally turning his back on me after seeing me counts as "hating" to me.
[2015/10/15 11:43:37] <Tobbi> Hume2: You two are not "people".
[2015/10/15 11:43:58] <Hume2> Tobbi: So whagt are we? Robots?
[2015/10/15 11:44:18] <Tobbi> Hume2: You guys are not people I care about in real life. We work on the same project together, that's all.
[2015/10/15 11:44:20] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/10/15 11:44:41] <Mathnerd314> then why aren't we talking about supertux...
[2015/10/15 11:44:42] <Hume2> OK
[2015/10/15 11:44:50] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: *sigh*.
[2015/10/15 11:45:07] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: No, honestly, maybe I showed off a little too much.
[2015/10/15 11:45:12] <Tobbi> But I feel unnoticed in real life.
[2015/10/15 11:45:23] <Mathnerd314> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9ms2WOZi74
[2015/10/15 11:45:26] <Hume2> I had this feeling once too.
[2015/10/15 11:45:42] <head8debian> Ok, 4 people are here, so lets vote. Option 1: change ruberduck levels. Option 2: leave rubberduck levels alone. What do you guys think?
[2015/10/15 11:45:50] <head8debian> I vote Option 1.
[2015/10/15 11:45:57] <Hume2> 1
[2015/10/15 11:46:13] <Tobbi> head8debian: Just change the worldmap.
[2015/10/15 11:46:20] <Tobbi> The levels are fine.
[2015/10/15 11:46:30] <head8debian> Thats what i meant...
[2015/10/15 11:46:58] <head8debian> But it doesnt seem right for a dev to "take over" someone elses worldmap.
[2015/10/15 11:47:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: What license are these under?
[2015/10/15 11:47:46] <Tobbi> We reworked a few levels anyway...
[2015/10/15 11:48:12] <Hume2> It has the GNU licence.
[2015/10/15 11:48:16] <Tobbi> Ergo...
[2015/10/15 11:49:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: DEBUGWARN: Tilegroup Halloween contains invalid TileID 1953
[2015/10/15 11:49:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: Who reworked the tiles recently?
[2015/10/15 11:50:46] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm. I don't now. Didnt howdoidothis add some?
[2015/10/15 11:51:00] <head8debian> There are 4 invalid tiles.
[2015/10/15 11:51:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: Find out whether the id ever existed...
[2015/10/15 11:51:34] <head8debian> uhm.
[2015/10/15 11:52:04] <Hume2> head8debian: I don't see tile 1953 anywhere in Halloween tilegroup.
[2015/10/15 11:53:04] <head8debian> Hume2: Open the old editor in a terminal. The error pops up in the terminal when you open a worldmap.
[2015/10/15 11:53:21] <Hume2> Oh, worldmap...
[2015/10/15 11:54:36] <Hume2> head8debian: It was Grumbel.
[2015/10/15 11:55:01] <head8debian> hmm. can we fix it?
[2015/10/15 11:57:13] <head8debian> I do remember how to use IDs...
[2015/10/15 11:57:49] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's actually, you show them when someone asks for them...Like, at the airport, for example.
[2015/10/15 11:58:16] <head8debian> Ah!
[2015/10/15 11:58:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ive never been to the airport...
[2015/10/15 11:58:32] <Tobbi> head8debian: Really???
[2015/10/15 11:58:34] <Tobbi> Never?
[2015/10/15 11:58:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: Still, thats a crummy way of doing it.
[2015/10/15 11:58:39] <head8debian> No, never.
[2015/10/15 11:58:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about crossing borders?
[2015/10/15 11:58:54] <head8debian> Well, we have been to watch planes take off and land. :)
[2015/10/15 11:59:05] <head8debian> Ive never been out of the USA.
[2015/10/15 11:59:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: You should at least go on a plane. It's fun.
[2015/10/15 11:59:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about other states?
[2015/10/15 11:59:26] <head8debian> Ohio and Indiana.

[2015/10/15 12:11:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's just a jump to the left...
[2015/10/15 12:24:44] <Hume2> head8debian: Guess, how to create a fog that is densier on the bottom of the level and gets clearer while going up.
[2015/10/15 12:26:57] <head8debian> Hume2: That will be cool! I have no clue how
[2015/10/15 12:27:11] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/15 12:27:28] <Hume2> head8debian: It is possible in 0.3.5 using gradient. Still no idea?
[2015/10/15 12:28:11] <head8debian> Hume2: It might be. Tobbi?
[2015/10/15 12:28:25] <Tobbi> head8debian: If hume thinks it is...
[2015/10/15 12:28:40] <Tobbi> Hume2: So, go ahead...how?
[2015/10/15 12:29:26] <Hume2> Tobbi and head8debian: use z-pos that is bigger than any other, for example 200.
[2015/10/15 12:29:38] <Hume2> It should work with 200.
[2015/10/15 12:31:15] <Tobbi> Good morning Karkus, by the way.
[2015/10/15 12:31:18] <head8debian> Tobbi: Tobbi Here is something you can listen to. It gives me an errie feeling. Especially if you are playing the game. https://gitlab.com/freedroid/freedroid-src/tree/master/sound/music
[2015/10/15 12:31:29] <Karkus> Morning/
[2015/10/15 12:31:30] <Karkus> ?
[2015/10/15 12:31:39] <head8debian> Hey Karkus !
[2015/10/15 12:31:48] <Karkus> hey :)
[2015/10/15 12:32:06] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have no idea. It's morning when someone enters and night when he leaves.
[2015/10/15 12:32:40] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay...
[2015/10/15 12:32:44] <Tobbi> Karkus: I've been wanting to ask you: What happened to the idea of using tables for the editor? Was that idea abandoned? Maybe you told me and I forgot.
[2015/10/15 12:32:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: For the properties
[2015/10/15 12:32:56] <Karkus> ?
[2015/10/15 12:33:00] <head8debian> Karkus: Just turned afternoon here. :D
[2015/10/15 12:33:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yup.
[2015/10/15 12:33:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: Which tune would you like me to listen to?
[2015/10/15 12:34:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: I have a working branch of it, but changing the values still has no effect.
[2015/10/15 12:34:26] <Karkus> I will take another look]
[2015/10/15 12:34:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yeah, it's not a priority anyway...
[2015/10/15 12:35:11] <head8debian> Tobbi: Hello Fortress2. Thats a good starter.
[2015/10/15 12:35:14] <head8debian> hehe.
[2015/10/15 12:35:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: I also have a working branch of the layers, but I'm still struggling with member names and python dynamic types :/
[2015/10/15 12:35:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, that's good.
[2015/10/15 12:35:54] <Tobbi> Karkus: Can you do a pull request? We can always look at them and improve them later...
[2015/10/15 12:35:57] <Hume2>     (gradient       (top_color 1 1 1 0)       (bottom_color 1 1 1 1)       (direction "vertical_sector")       (z-pos 200)     )
[2015/10/15 12:36:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: I will, after I've made a few more changes
[2015/10/15 12:36:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: Then "the begining" then "tech battle". :D
[2015/10/15 12:36:21] <Tobbi> Karkus: Sure.
[2015/10/15 12:36:35] <Tobbi> Hume2: It's great that someone's actually using those new direction types. :D
[2015/10/15 12:36:38] <head8debian> I like them all. :D
[2015/10/15 12:36:49] <Tobbi> I'm always happy to see that my work has at least some impact.
[2015/10/15 12:37:54] <Hume2> I will use it i my levels sometimes.
[2015/10/15 12:38:14] <Tobbi> Hume2: So, you're designing your own?
[2015/10/15 12:38:38] <Hume2> Tobbi: Yes, I'm now working on a new addon called "Overundeground".
[2015/10/15 12:39:03] <Tobbi> Hume2: But there was that "Overunderground tower" if I remember correctly...
[2015/10/15 12:39:14] <Tobbi> Hume2: Do you have a level for me to test and give feedback on?
[2015/10/15 12:39:38] <Hume2> Tobbi: Yes, I'll show you one level.

[2015/10/15 12:44:17] <Hume2> Yes, you remember correctly that there is an overunderground tower. It is in two worldmaps. It's my favourite structure.
[2015/10/15 12:47:59] <Tobbi> Hume2: The level is okay...a little bit too many badguys for my taste but otherwise...
[2015/10/15 12:48:20] <Hume2> Thanks for testing :)
[2015/10/15 12:48:52] <Tobbi> Karkus: To be honest, I feel a little bad about having to let you code on the editor on your own... I intend to continue coding soon...
[2015/10/15 12:50:18] <Tobbi> So that you don't have the feeling that it's all your task...that'd be huge.
[2015/10/15 12:50:23] <Karkus> Tobbi: I should feel bad... I havent committed for a week. It's no problem.
[2015/10/15 12:50:31] <Tobbi> Okay, good.

[2015/10/15 13:34:16] <head8debian> I get <no title> if  i load the worldmap directly. then enter causes it to crash.

[2015/10/15 14:45:59] <Tobbi> head8debian, Okay, I will try it soon.
[2015/10/15 14:53:04] <head8debian> Karkus: Why do you chose a name that sounds like carcass?
[2015/10/15 14:54:00] <head8debian> Karkus: :p
[2015/10/15 14:55:58] <Tobbi> I never knew the meaning of this word.
[2015/10/15 14:56:13] <head8debian> Tobbi: carcass means bones of a rotten dead animal...
[2015/10/15 14:56:22] <head8debian> Like a skeleton.
[2015/10/15 14:56:24] <Tobbi> head8debian, I have googled it in the meantime.
[2015/10/15 14:56:28] <head8debian> :p
[2015/10/15 14:56:34] <head8debian> Of course...
[2015/10/15 14:56:39] <head8debian> I hate the term google...
[2015/10/15 14:56:55] <Tobbi> I hate the term hate.
[2015/10/15 14:57:02] <Tobbi> I also hate the term term.
[2015/10/15 14:57:02] <head8debian> Me too. :D

[2015/10/15 15:02:16] <Karkus> head8debian: Why did you choose your nick?
[2015/10/15 15:02:34] <head8debian> Karkus: I used to run debian 8 on all of my machines.
[2015/10/15 15:02:43] <head8debian> Karkus: Im just curious! good grief.
[2015/10/15 15:03:41] <Karkus> head8debian: Hey, I'm not trying to be rude
[2015/10/15 15:04:05] <head8debian> Karkus: Ok, ok. :)
[2015/10/15 15:04:09] <Karkus> There's no reason I guess
[2015/10/15 15:04:24] <head8debian> Well, good. :)
[2015/10/15 15:04:56] <head8debian> Wow, my html was giving me a fit of errors because i forgot a 3> at the end of a line. o_O
[2015/10/15 15:04:59] <head8debian> Good!
[2015/10/15 15:05:04] <Tobbi> head8debian, What about head@desk ?
[2015/10/15 15:05:19] <Tobbi> head8debian, html is so boring...
[2015/10/15 15:05:30] <Tobbi> head8debian, Try JS basics...
[2015/10/15 15:05:49] <Tobbi> head8debian, Create a new test.js file
[2015/10/15 15:05:53] <Karkus> HTML is not real programming :P
[2015/10/15 15:05:54] @ giby_the_kid joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/15 15:06:13] <Tobbi> Then, in your html HEAD, write this: <script type="text/javascript" src="test.js" />
[2015/10/15 15:06:48] <Tobbi> Tell me when you're done with that.
[2015/10/15 15:07:36] <Karkus> head8debian: What is it you're doing?

[2015/10/15 15:14:29] <Tobbi> head8debian, Also, make sure that the js file is in the same directory as the HTML file, okay?
[2015/10/15 15:14:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yay, you remember the / at the end. :D
[2015/10/15 15:14:36] <head8debian> I know.
[2015/10/15 15:14:48] <head8debian> Otherwise it would be a no-go...
[2015/10/15 15:15:03] <Tobbi> head8debian, Who do you think I am?

[2015/10/15 15:16:48] <Tobbi> head8debian, You're supposed to close it.
[2015/10/15 15:16:52] <Tobbi> Or maybe.
[2015/10/15 15:17:09] <Tobbi> head8debian, <script type="text/javascript" src="test.js"></script>
[2015/10/15 15:17:13] <head8debian> Ah!
[2015/10/15 15:17:14] <Tobbi> Maybe like that ^^
[2015/10/15 15:17:37] <Tobbi> head8debian, Once that's in place, open test.js with an editor.
[2015/10/15 15:17:50] <head8debian> Still isn't correct. :p
[2015/10/15 15:18:11] <Tobbi> head8debian, Error message?
[2015/10/15 15:18:20] <Tobbi> Also, what HTML version are you using?
[2015/10/15 15:18:30] <Tobbi> head8debian, You might not want to close it at all.
[2015/10/15 15:18:39] <Tobbi> <script type="text/javascript" src="test.html">
[2015/10/15 15:18:42] <Tobbi> Does that work?
[2015/10/15 15:18:51] <Tobbi> eeh, test.js

[2015/10/15 15:20:13] <Tobbi> Karkus, Mine.
[2015/10/15 15:20:13] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/15 15:20:21] <Tobbi> My site.
[2015/10/15 15:20:22] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/15 15:20:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: But what?
[2015/10/15 15:20:41] <Tobbi> Karkus, This was an assignment we had to do for college.
[2015/10/15 15:20:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, lets give the javascript a breat atm. :D
[2015/10/15 15:20:54] <Tobbi> head8debian, JavaScript is no duck. It can't digest bread.
[2015/10/15 15:21:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is it supposed to be upside down?
[2015/10/15 15:21:14] <head8debian> break* :p
[2015/10/15 15:21:16] <Tobbi> Karkus, Of course.
[2015/10/15 15:21:30] <Tobbi> Karkus, We were allowed to use whatever CSS properties we deemed necessary.
[2015/10/15 15:21:30] <head8debian> We can give it bread though. :D
[2015/10/15 15:21:41] <Tobbi> head8debian, Ignore your HTML checker for once.
[2015/10/15 15:21:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: Exactly what kind of assignment was this?
[2015/10/15 15:21:48] <Tobbi> Does the side load okay?
[2015/10/15 15:21:53] <Tobbi> Karkus, I actually can't remember.
[2015/10/15 15:21:57] <Tobbi> This was several years back...
[2015/10/15 15:22:09] <head8debian> <kbd dir="rtl">ohw</kbd>. :p
[2015/10/15 15:22:10] <Karkus> Okay.
[2015/10/15 15:23:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ive been trying to write my html cleaner this time...
[2015/10/15 15:23:29] <Tobbi> head8debian, Okay, whatever. Who cares about HTML anyway.
[2015/10/15 15:23:30] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/15 15:23:35] <Tobbi> head8debian, Open the JS file.
[2015/10/15 15:24:10] <head8debian> Its open, but not linked...
[2015/10/15 15:24:50] <Karkus> head8debian: What are you using to write your HTML?
[2015/10/15 15:24:50] <Tobbi> head8debian, *sigh* What's wrong?
[2015/10/15 15:25:33] <head8debian> Tobbi: How about i get through my courses then w3schools can teach me html?
[2015/10/15 15:25:38] <head8debian> Karkus: Atom.
[2015/10/15 15:25:56] <Tobbi> head8debian, Who cares about HTML??? :D It's JavaScript you want...

[2015/10/15 15:28:03] <Tobbi_> head8debian: When I was younger, I thought to cry means "schreien"...
[2015/10/15 15:28:06] <Tobbi_> But it's not.
[2015/10/15 15:29:02] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Well sometimes. (I looked it up)
[2015/10/15 15:29:09] <head8debian> Whats schreien mean?
[2015/10/15 15:29:25] <Karkus> "cry out"?
[2015/10/15 15:29:41] <Tobbi_> I would translate it as "weinen".
[2015/10/15 15:29:41] <Karkus> Tobbi:?
[2015/10/15 15:29:54] <Tobbi_> I mean: Weinen = to cry...
[2015/10/15 15:29:59] <Tobbi_> And scheien = to yell...
[2015/10/15 15:30:01] <Tobbi_> IMO
[2015/10/15 15:30:55] <Karkus> Tobbi_: When did you first learn English?
[2015/10/15 15:30:56] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/10/15 15:31:10] <Tobbi_> Karkus: We learned the first few basic phrases in the 4th grade.
[2015/10/15 15:31:16] <head8debian> Karkus: I like Atom for html. Its like cheating. :p
[2015/10/15 15:31:56] <Karkus> what age is 4th grade?
[2015/10/15 15:32:04] <Tobbi_> Karkus: ~ age 10.
[2015/10/15 15:32:15] <Tobbi_> But we only learned numbers and colours then.
[2015/10/15 15:32:33] <Karkus> head8debian: I dont think so :P
[2015/10/15 15:32:45] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Oh, I see.
[2015/10/15 15:32:49] <head8debian> I know. Autofill is nice though.
[2015/10/15 15:33:35] <Karkus> Do most people in Germany speak English as well you Tobbi?
[2015/10/15 15:34:09] <Karkus> head8debian: Some people think any autofill or suggestions are cheating. They need to go back to vim :P
[2015/10/15 15:35:31] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Many Germans have at least a basic understanding of English...
[2015/10/15 15:35:56] <Tobbi_> Most of the younger generation is, as far as I think, fairly fluent in English, anyway.
[2015/10/15 15:36:22] <Tobbi_> My father, though, doesn't understand a word of English.
[2015/10/15 15:36:43] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Interesting.
[2015/10/15 15:37:08] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Besides, you know, I did that internship in California that made me gain a lot of speaking experience.
[2015/10/15 15:37:28] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Over here not many people progress beyond school level german
[2015/10/15 15:37:42] <head8debian> Karkus: I couldn't use a terminal without autofill.
[2015/10/15 15:37:54] <Tobbi_> Karkus: German is miniscule compared to English.
[2015/10/15 15:38:02] <head8debian> It owuld be ToRtUrE.
[2015/10/15 15:38:47] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Do you mean in difficulty?
[2015/10/15 15:39:43] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Notability...
[2015/10/15 15:40:10] <Tobbi_> Karkus: You need English everywhere, German not so much.
[2015/10/15 15:40:49] <Tobbi_> head8debian: Can you please give me a screenshot of how the worldmap looks like?

[2015/10/15 15:43:41] <Tobbi_> :D
[2015/10/15 15:43:46] <Tobbi_> Can you try to add some more gimmicks?
[2015/10/15 15:43:47] <Karkus> Tobbi_: True.
[2015/10/15 15:43:55] <Karkus> Unfortunately???
[2015/10/15 15:44:07] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Why unfortunately?
[2015/10/15 15:46:02] <head8debian> ...
[2015/10/15 15:46:09] <head8debian> Its better than it was.
[2015/10/15 15:46:21] <Tobbi_> head8debian: I know... but that's not hard.
[2015/10/15 15:46:49] <head8debian> maybe later.
[2015/10/15 15:46:58] <Tobbi_> head8debian: Sure, no pressure.
[2015/10/15 15:47:22] <Tobbi_> But if you don't get it done by now + 1 hour, you won't be happy for a longer time :P
[2015/10/15 15:47:29] <Tobbi_> But, yeah, no pressure :D

[2015/10/15 15:50:47] <Tobbi_> leyyin: Which bread?
[2015/10/15 15:50:54] <leyyin> does it matter? :D
[2015/10/15 15:50:56] <leyyin> it's Europe
[2015/10/15 15:51:06] <Tobbi_> leyyin: It's not hard to get worse than American bread.
[2015/10/15 15:51:30] <Tobbi_> We had pancakes and shit for breakfast...
[2015/10/15 15:51:38] <leyyin> you had shit?
[2015/10/15 15:51:45] <Tobbi_> I knew you were gonna ask that.
[2015/10/15 15:51:48] <Tobbi_> I didn't mean that literally.
[2015/10/15 15:51:51] <leyyin> I hope you washed your mouth with soap ;)

[2015/10/15 15:58:51] <Tobbi_> head8debian: What? I don't know? I don't know anything about computers, remember?
[2015/10/15 15:58:53] <leyyin> what?
[2015/10/15 15:59:02] <leyyin> CSS3 is CSS3
[2015/10/15 15:59:05] <leyyin> what is W3.CSS?
[2015/10/15 15:59:23] <leyyin> w3 = http://www.w3.org/ ?
[2015/10/15 15:59:54] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I feel sad that languages like this are diminishing so quickly...
[2015/10/15 16:00:00] <head8debian> http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp
[2015/10/15 16:00:07] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Languages like German?
[2015/10/15 16:00:38] <leyyin> head8debian, that is stupid w3schools library or idk
[2015/10/15 16:00:43] <leyyin> do not use w3schools
[2015/10/15 16:00:59] <head8debian> odd...
[2015/10/15 16:01:39] <leyyin> always when you search web dev related
[2015/10/15 16:01:40] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Any language I guess
[2015/10/15 16:01:46] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Possibly...
[2015/10/15 16:01:47] <leyyin> introduce 'mozilla'
[2015/10/15 16:01:55] <leyyin> so that it takes you to their documentation
[2015/10/15 16:02:02] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Which language do you prefer?
[2015/10/15 16:02:33] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Hmm, that's a good question... I don't prefer either language. Speaking English is always quite cool because I'm trying to perfect my elegance...
[2015/10/15 16:02:38] <Tobbi_> And German, well...
[2015/10/15 16:02:57] <head8debian> I think i will just learn good 'ol CSS, html and javascript(hopefully).
[2015/10/15 16:02:58] <Tobbi_> Since I know German, it's not much of a challenge to me.
[2015/10/15 16:03:02] <Karkus> Tobbi_: You could have convinced me you were English -.-
[2015/10/15 16:03:06] <head8debian> All this other junk that pops up...
[2015/10/15 16:03:07] <head8debian> :p
[2015/10/15 16:03:14] <leyyin> head8debian, good old is CSS3 and HTML5
[2015/10/15 16:03:16] <leyyin> learn that
[2015/10/15 16:03:16] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Convinced you to do what?
[2015/10/15 16:03:32] <head8debian> leyyin: Why css3 over css?
[2015/10/15 16:03:35] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Is that a joke?
[2015/10/15 16:03:37] <head8debian> I know its newer... but.
[2015/10/15 16:03:46] <leyyin> head8debian, because it is the standard now
[2015/10/15 16:03:50] <leyyin> not the '90 crap
[2015/10/15 16:03:52] <Tobbi_> Karkus: You mean: I could've convinced you to learn German?
[2015/10/15 16:04:09] <leyyin> Tobbi, can you teach me german?
[2015/10/15 16:04:18] <head8debian> Karkus: Tobbi knows english so well because he has talked to me so much. :D
[2015/10/15 16:04:21] <Tobbi_> leyyin: I don't know anything about languages.
[2015/10/15 16:04:23] <Karkus> Tobbi_: No. *sigh* You've now destroyed my original statement
[2015/10/15 16:04:31] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Sorry...
[2015/10/15 16:04:52] <head8debian> leyyin: But not everyone uses the latest browser...
[2015/10/15 16:04:53] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I meant you are so good, I would have thought you were english, but you're IP thingy
[2015/10/15 16:04:57] <Karkus> *your
[2015/10/15 16:05:00] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Ah!
[2015/10/15 16:05:05] * head8debian looks at windows <7 users...
[2015/10/15 16:05:09] <leyyin> head8debian, you do not use firefox 4+ or chrome 1+ ?
[2015/10/15 16:05:17] <leyyin> head8debian, they are non existent
[2015/10/15 16:06:36] <head8debian> They are very existent. At least in this part of the world.
[2015/10/15 16:06:37] <leyyin> windows xp => your machine is a security bomb
[2015/10/15 16:06:37] <Karkus> Tobbi_: But I am learning German :P
[2015/10/15 16:06:37] <leyyin> waiting to go off
[2015/10/15 16:06:37] <Tobbi_> Karkus: According to my English teacher at college, I'm on the B2 level...
[2015/10/15 16:06:37] <Tobbi_> *at
[2015/10/15 16:06:37] <Karkus> B2?
[2015/10/15 16:06:37] <Tobbi_> Wait a moment.
[2015/10/15 16:06:37] <Karkus> at a mysterious place
[2015/10/15 16:06:37] <head8debian> leyyin: i know, i know...
[2015/10/15 16:06:37] <Tobbi_> Karkus: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages
[2015/10/15 16:06:44] <Tobbi_> Karkus: B2 is already quite good.
[2015/10/15 16:06:51] <leyyin> I am C1 or C2
[2015/10/15 16:06:51] <Karkus> tobbi_: Ive heard of this
[2015/10/15 16:07:26] <Tobbi_> leyyin: Congratulations. :)
[2015/10/15 16:07:55] <Tobbi_> leyyin: Or would you say I'm C1 as well? I don't feel very C1-y.
[2015/10/15 16:08:07] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I dont think I could categorise anyone using this, as the actual definition is not written in english I can understand 0.o
[2015/10/15 16:08:07] <Tobbi_> According to a test I did, that said C1. but, no.
[2015/10/15 16:08:14] <Tobbi_> :D right
[2015/10/15 16:08:52] <leyyin> Tobbi, you are C1 at least
[2015/10/15 16:08:58] <Tobbi_> Alright.
[2015/10/15 16:09:12] <Karkus> It depends on your actions in real life situations as well as by text. I guess if you've been to America for a while you're c1
[2015/10/15 16:09:26] <Tobbi_> Karkus: I've been to America for 3 months...
[2015/10/15 16:09:36] <leyyin> merica
[2015/10/15 16:09:36] <Tobbi_> For an internship at Mozilla...and that was demanding...
[2015/10/15 16:09:38] <leyyin> *cries*
[2015/10/15 16:09:52] <Tobbi_> leyyin: I was so relieved I was home...you cannot believe that.
[2015/10/15 16:09:57] <Tobbi_> *when
[2015/10/15 16:10:01] <head8debian> Tobbi_: What fun. :D http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_images_map
[2015/10/15 16:10:17] <head8debian> I guess when i need that i will go digging for it...
[2015/10/15 16:10:18] <Tobbi_> head8debian: area maps are so 1980...
[2015/10/15 16:10:26] <leyyin> this ^
[2015/10/15 16:10:31] <Karkus> Tobbi_: O.o Mozilla :D
[2015/10/15 16:10:42] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I use chromium
[2015/10/15 16:10:48] <Tobbi_> Karkus: You can find my name in the Firefox credits, even ;)
[2015/10/15 16:10:52] <leyyin> Karkus, you have a lot of RAM? :P
[2015/10/15 16:11:03] <Karkus> leyyin: No?
[2015/10/15 16:11:08] <Tobbi_> Karkus: I can't blame you for that... Mozilla went downhill immediately after I left >D
[2015/10/15 16:11:09] <Tobbi_> :D
[2015/10/15 16:11:11] <Karkus> Tobbi_: cool
[2015/10/15 16:11:19] <head8debian> Firefox is more of a ram hog. :) Try leaving a tab open for a week on end.
[2015/10/15 16:11:23] <head8debian> Chrome is bad also.
[2015/10/15 16:11:24] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Yes that was why; I remembe now
[2015/10/15 16:11:26] <leyyin> *cough* mozilla != firefox
[2015/10/15 16:11:28] <Tobbi_> That is, unless they removed me because I was a trouble-maker.
[2015/10/15 16:11:29] <Tobbi_> :D
[2015/10/15 16:11:33] <head8debian> Not *that* bad though.
[2015/10/15 16:11:35] <Karkus> head8debian: Midori?
[2015/10/15 16:11:43] <Karkus> leyyin: ik
[2015/10/15 16:11:58] <leyyin> head8debian, you obviously do not open 20 tabs in chrome and firefox to compare ;)
[2015/10/15 16:11:59] <head8debian> I dont like browsers that dont have big teams personally...
[2015/10/15 16:12:05] <head8debian> Nope.
[2015/10/15 16:12:17] <head8debian> I just left them open. :D
[2015/10/15 16:12:21] <Tobbi_> head8debian: So you write your own browser?
[2015/10/15 16:12:23] <Karkus> eh? double negative?
[2015/10/15 16:12:29] <Tobbi_> Ah.
[2015/10/15 16:12:34] <Tobbi_> Confused me too...
[2015/10/15 16:12:56] <Karkus> I am thoughraly confused
[2015/10/15 16:13:03] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/10/15 16:13:09] <Karkus> I cant spell :'(
[2015/10/15 16:13:11] <head8debian> I use both firefox and chrome.
[2015/10/15 16:13:24] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Back to the topic of English: My English improved a lot after I graduated high school...
[2015/10/15 16:13:35] <head8debian> Is that you Tobbi_ typing? :p http://www.w3schools.com/html/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_images1
[2015/10/15 16:13:35] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Why?
[2015/10/15 16:13:42] <Tobbi_> Due to watching English movies and trying to understand everything.
[2015/10/15 16:13:55] <Tobbi_> head8debian: *sigh* No?
[2015/10/15 16:14:03] <head8debian> Tobbi_: It was a joke...
[2015/10/15 16:14:04] <Tobbi_> head8debian: My typing is more hipster than that.
[2015/10/15 16:15:12] <Tobbi_> I have a disco ball in my room and some disco music...
[2015/10/15 16:15:12] <Karkus> head8debian: You got out-joked
[2015/10/15 16:15:12] <Tobbi_> Yup.
[2015/10/15 16:15:12] <Karkus> thoroughly
[2015/10/15 16:15:12] <Karkus> YAY
[2015/10/15 16:15:12] <head8debian> :D
[2015/10/15 16:15:23] <Karkus> Also I use duckduckgo instead of google. How hipster is that?
[2015/10/15 16:15:32] <Tobbi_> leyyin: Did you get added to some kind of credits for being an intern?
[2015/10/15 16:15:33] <head8debian> Karkus: Me too. :D
[2015/10/15 16:15:42] <leyyin> Tobbi, credits?
[2015/10/15 16:15:54] <Tobbi_> leyyin: For <whatever product it was you were working on>?
[2015/10/15 16:16:00] <Karkus> leyyin: Where were you an intern
[2015/10/15 16:16:01] <head8debian> I prefer even Bing over google...
[2015/10/15 16:16:10] <leyyin> head8debian, you watch a lot of porn?
[2015/10/15 16:16:15] <Karkus> head8debian: I dont dislike google

[2015/10/15 16:16:46] <leyyin> Karkus, Google
[2015/10/15 16:16:59] <Tobbi_> leyyin: Will there be a chance I will get to see your name?
[2015/10/15 16:17:04] <Tobbi_> *Is there a chance.
[2015/10/15 16:17:06] <leyyin> aa, no
[2015/10/15 16:17:07] <Karkus> leyyin: Wow!
[2015/10/15 16:17:12] <head8debian> leyyin: huh?
[2015/10/15 16:17:23] <leyyin> Tobbi, the credits are internal only
[2015/10/15 16:17:31] <leyyin> head8debian, bing is good at searching porn
[2015/10/15 16:17:31] <head8debian> Karkus: I get better results usually from bing. I don't hate google.
[2015/10/15 16:17:34] <Tobbi_> Karkus: To be fair, they contacted me as well, asking me whether I'd like to work for them, but I seriously killed that chance :P
[2015/10/15 16:17:48] <Tobbi_> leyyin: Ah, okay...
[2015/10/15 16:17:51] <head8debian> leyyin: No i don't watch porn. and i have no want to either...
[2015/10/15 16:17:58] <leyyin> Tobbi, the product is not open source ;)
[2015/10/15 16:18:05] <Tobbi_> leyyin: hrm, alright.
[2015/10/15 16:18:06] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Why you two? How come?
[2015/10/15 16:18:09] <head8debian> leyyin: And how do you know its better for watching porn on? :p
[2015/10/15 16:18:09] <leyyin> head8debian, of course you do, we all do :D
[2015/10/15 16:18:17] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Totally unrelated to each other, obviously.
[2015/10/15 16:18:29] * head8debian rolls his eyes...
[2015/10/15 16:18:52] <Tobbi_> Karkus: So, I believe it was because of my previous involvement with Mozilla that they contacted me but I can't be sure...
[2015/10/15 16:18:55] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Really? Nah..
[2015/10/15 16:19:11] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Why'd you turn them down?
[2015/10/15 16:19:20] <Tobbi_> Karkus: They turned me down.
[2015/10/15 16:19:27] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Oh...
[2015/10/15 16:19:45] <Karkus> I thought you implied otherwise
[2015/10/15 16:19:49] <Tobbi_> Karkus: leyyin applied and got accepted, I didn't apply (but they applied for me) and turned me down after seeing my insufficient CV
[2015/10/15 16:20:11] <Karkus> leyyin: What did you have to do?
[2015/10/15 16:20:34] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Actually, it's more complicated than that. They originally thought I was from the United States... Upon seeing Germany in my CV, they forwarded it to the hiring managers in Europe.
[2015/10/15 16:21:00] <Tobbi_> Which apparently didn't have any offerings for me at that time.
[2015/10/15 16:21:04] <Tobbi_> But I could of course apply again.
[2015/10/15 16:21:04] <leyyin> Karkus, I got an internal reference
[2015/10/15 16:21:11] <leyyin> classic interviews, etc
[2015/10/15 16:22:38] <Tobbi_> leyyin: I still kind of envy you. Unlike me, they like you :D
[2015/10/15 16:23:19] <Tobbi_> But on the other hand, I could've gotten that job with ease... :P
[2015/10/15 16:23:25] <Tobbi_> If I really put everything into it.
[2015/10/15 16:23:27] <Tobbi_> And I didn't...
[2015/10/15 16:23:42] <Tobbi_> And I'm kind of glad I didn't.

[2015/10/15 16:24:36] <Karkus> Tobbi_: What affiliation do you have with Mozilla?
[2015/10/15 16:25:01] <Tobbi_> Karkus: former long-time community member and former intern.
[2015/10/15 16:26:23] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Community member?
[2015/10/15 16:26:23] <Tobbi_> Karkus: There's a community around Mozilla...which used to be quite cool.
[2015/10/15 16:26:28] <Karkus> Tobbi_: What did your internship involve?
[2015/10/15 16:26:40] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Quality Assurance for Web sites.
[2015/10/15 16:26:54] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Fun?
[2015/10/15 16:26:56] <Tobbi_> I could've gotten an internship with Support as well, but I wanted to do some more technical things...
[2015/10/15 16:27:07] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Uhm...good question...
[2015/10/15 16:27:11] <Karkus> :P
[2015/10/15 16:27:20] <Tobbi_> Karkus: I was looking for some more challenges...
[2015/10/15 16:27:25] <Karkus> I like to think I am good at asking questions :D
[2015/10/15 16:27:27] @ Quit: claymore2: Quit: Leaving
[2015/10/15 16:27:32] <Tobbi_> Writing selenium the whole day was exhausting.
[2015/10/15 16:27:38] <Tobbi_> Not to mention the American culture...
[2015/10/15 16:27:48] <Tobbi_> Vastly different from the German culture.
[2015/10/15 16:28:22] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Ever been to Britain?
[2015/10/15 16:28:34] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Only for Mozilla-related activities.
[2015/10/15 16:28:40] <Tobbi_> We had a weekend meeting there...
[2015/10/15 16:28:42] <Tobbi_> for two days...
[2015/10/15 16:28:53] <Tobbi_> I believe in 2010? 2011? idk

[2015/10/15 16:39:27] <Tobbi_> Karkus: done?
[2015/10/15 16:40:34] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Yes
[2015/10/15 16:40:36] <Karkus> thx
[2015/10/15 16:40:38] <Tobbi_> Okay.
[2015/10/15 16:40:52] <Karkus> leyyin: Does python3 'stop' circular imports?
[2015/10/15 16:41:02] <Karkus> or tobbi_
[2015/10/15 16:41:12] <Tobbi_> I don't know :D
[2015/10/15 16:41:31] <Karkus> :P
[2015/10/15 16:41:33] <leyyin> Karkus, all python version do....
[2015/10/15 16:41:39] <leyyin> they are modules
[2015/10/15 16:41:47] <Karkus> leyyin: Eh?
[2015/10/15 16:41:49] <leyyin> this is not C++
[2015/10/15 16:41:49] <Karkus> nope
[2015/10/15 16:42:00] <Karkus> but... I'm sure...
[2015/10/15 16:42:08] <Karkus> let me look
[2015/10/15 16:42:58] <leyyin> just tested a.py and b.py
[2015/10/15 16:43:05] <leyyin> a.py include b, and b includes a
[2015/10/15 16:43:14] <Karkus> leyyin: But did you do import a?
[2015/10/15 16:43:32] <leyyin> read above
[2015/10/15 16:44:17] <Karkus> I mean, try from a import something  and  from b import <something>
[2015/10/15 16:45:37] <leyyin> you are importing things from modules
[2015/10/15 16:45:39] <leyyin> not modules
[2015/10/15 16:46:07] <leyyin> if you just import modules all is fine
[2015/10/15 16:46:19] <Karkus> Okay
[2015/10/15 16:46:21] <leyyin> and if you have circular references, your design has a serious problem
[2015/10/15 16:46:49] <Karkus> leyyin: ik
[2015/10/15 16:48:08] <Karkus> leyyin: Thanks for the clarification
[2015/10/15 16:49:32] <Tobbi_> leyyin: Circular references are the basis for ruling the world.
[2015/10/15 16:50:13] <Karkus> Tobbi_: They are?
[2015/10/15 16:50:29] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Of course. but don't trust me. I don't know anything about computers.
[2015/10/15 16:50:52] <Karkus> Tobbi_: You often say that. Why?
[2015/10/15 16:51:46] @ Quit: bb010g: Quit: Connection closed for inactivity
[2015/10/15 16:52:11] <Tobbi_> Karkus: It's a good question...Because I want to get my mind off that topic. And because I want to distinguish myself from all those nerds.
[2015/10/15 16:52:29] <Karkus> 'those nerds'
[2015/10/15 16:52:33] <Tobbi_> Karkus: To be honest, in my computer science masters class are a lot of people who are... annoying...
[2015/10/15 16:52:35] <Tobbi_> And I can't stand them.
[2015/10/15 16:52:49] <leyyin> haters gonna hate man
[2015/10/15 16:52:51] <Tobbi_> By saying "I don't know anything about computers" I remind myself that I want to live a normal life ;)
[2015/10/15 16:53:07] <Tobbi_> leyyin: I know. You can call me a hater.
[2015/10/15 16:53:11] <Tobbi_> I wouldn't even be mad.
[2015/10/15 16:53:23] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Whats the other option to 'a normal life'?
[2015/10/15 16:53:52] <Tobbi_> Karkus: An unnormal life.
[2015/10/15 16:54:20] <leper`> death?
[2015/10/15 16:54:47] <Karkus> leper`: Probably
[2015/10/15 16:55:24] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I read that as 'unmoral'
[2015/10/15 16:55:52] <Tobbi> I realized that I played by the rules of my professors too often. Just focused on my career, on getting a college degree...But what ultimately counts is what I want.
[2015/10/15 16:55:55] <Karkus> Yes I know that isn't a word
[2015/10/15 16:56:12] <leyyin> gn nerds ;)
[2015/10/15 16:56:16] <Karkus> (Other) Tobbi: Too true
[2015/10/15 16:56:18] <Tobbi> And I believe the best thing is to take a step back.
[2015/10/15 16:56:47] <leper`> try not doing that while looking away from the abyss
[2015/10/15 16:57:08] @ Quit: leyyin: Quit: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
[2015/10/15 16:57:18] <Karkus> leper`: Do you have some kind of obsession with death?
[2015/10/15 16:57:19] <Tobbi> Karkus, You know, in my family I am the first one who graduated. And I'm very proud about that fact...
[2015/10/15 16:57:56] <Tobbi> And part of me wants to get as high a college degree as possible. But the other part of me is just so tired. I'd only want a higher degree to show off, anyway :D
[2015/10/15 16:58:03] <Tobbi> This is where life has gotten me :D
[2015/10/15 16:58:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: You should have taken a break?
[2015/10/15 16:58:31] <Tobbi> Karkus, I should have. But I couldn't.
[2015/10/15 16:58:40] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why not?
[2015/10/15 16:58:52] <Tobbi> Karkus, I didn't allow myself one...
[2015/10/15 16:59:11] <Tobbi> I was so in the "I need to work on something" mood that I didn't allow myself a break.
[2015/10/15 16:59:32] <Tobbi> At the same time, I don't think it's as high an achievement as it might be, this degree...Because in the end it was far too easy :D
[2015/10/15 17:00:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, :P
[2015/10/15 17:01:03] <Tobbi> Karkus, I know, I know. Most of my problems are self-made.
[2015/10/15 17:01:15] <Tobbi> Karkus, Are you in college / high school ?
[2015/10/15 17:01:25] <Tobbi> Or do you want to attend college?
[2015/10/15 17:01:31] <Karkus> High School. Did you guess yet?
[2015/10/15 17:01:43] <Tobbi> Karkus, I kind of did. Do you want to attend college?
[2015/10/15 17:01:53] <Karkus> Err university, yeah
[2015/10/15 17:02:10] <Tobbi> Karkus, Sorry, I am too americanized. We call it Universität as well.
[2015/10/15 17:02:16] <Karkus> Ik
[2015/10/15 17:02:16] <Tobbi> Karkus, Studying computer science or something else?
[2015/10/15 17:02:23] <Karkus> I think Maths
[2015/10/15 17:02:26] <Karkus> I like maths
[2015/10/15 17:02:31] <Tobbi> Karkus, Prepare for group theory.
[2015/10/15 17:02:44] <Karkus> Right
[2015/10/15 17:03:37] <leper`> Karkus: Why'd you think that?
[2015/10/15 17:03:59] <Karkus> leper`: Think what?
[2015/10/15 17:04:25] <leper`> that obsession assumption above
[2015/10/15 17:04:49] @ Quit: Tobbi_: Remote host closed the connection
[2015/10/15 17:05:11] <Tobbi> oh.
[2015/10/15 17:06:15] <Karkus> leper`: Err... You remained silent and then mentioned death twice? Idk.
[2015/10/15 17:07:40] <Tobbi> People with an obsession with death are often serial killers themself.
[2015/10/15 17:07:45] <Tobbi> But they could also be cereal killers.
[2015/10/15 17:07:47] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/15 17:08:32] <leper`> Karkus: well seemed somewhat appropriate since Tobbi seems to like dark humour and I was distracted by cake
[2015/10/15 17:08:35] <Karkus> I eat lots of Shreddies, does that count?
[2015/10/15 17:09:18] <Tobbi> leper`, it's kinda weird...I used to hate dark humour...it was a line I never crossed...
[2015/10/15 17:09:27] <Tobbi> But then I realized that it kinda helps me...
[2015/10/15 17:09:39] <Tobbi> There's nothing wrong about that, anyway.
[2015/10/15 17:09:47] <leper`> crossing lines?
[2015/10/15 17:10:20] <Tobbi> leper`, My family is conservative, it was kinda prohibited to make jokes about death and everything.
[2015/10/15 17:10:50] <Tobbi> I have just grown into liking dark humour recently...
[2015/10/15 17:11:14] <Tobbi> death is fascinating...
[2015/10/15 17:11:16] <Tobbi> In a way...
[2015/10/15 17:11:22] <Karkus> I think necrophilia is too far. Other than that, go ahead
[2015/10/15 17:11:30] <Karkus> :P

[2015/10/15 17:11:59] <Tobbi> Karkus, Necrophilia is disgusting...
[2015/10/15 17:12:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: ...
[2015/10/15 17:12:19] <Tobbi> Same goes for pedophilia and a couple other things in that area...
[2015/10/15 17:12:27] <Tobbi> Karkus, Don't get me started...
[2015/10/15 17:12:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: Of course
[2015/10/15 17:13:36] <Tobbi> Karkus, Actually, when you think about it: As long as people don't carry out their tendency...
[2015/10/15 17:13:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Some interesting ethics though...
[2015/10/15 17:13:43] <Tobbi> But still, it's uneasy...
[2015/10/15 17:14:54] <Karkus> Of course I think it's disgusting.
[2015/10/15 17:15:27] <Tobbi> Karkus, I am glad that Germany has "Projekt Dunkelfeld", a project that helps pedophiles find their way...
[2015/10/15 17:16:05] <Tobbi> Karkus, On the other hand: As far as I know, the minority of child molesters are pedophiles.
[2015/10/15 17:16:12] <Tobbi> s/know/have read.
[2015/10/15 17:16:26] <Tobbi> Karkus, Just say stop if it gets too uneasy...
[2015/10/15 17:16:29] <Tobbi> *when
[2015/10/15 17:16:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: I fail to see the distinction
[2015/10/15 17:17:13] <Tobbi> Karkus, The difference between "not eating chocolate because it's forbidden" and "eating chocolate although it's forbidden"
[2015/10/15 17:17:29] <Tobbi> Karkus, Only because you're into women doesn't mean you molest them.
[2015/10/15 17:17:34] <Tobbi> right?
[2015/10/15 17:17:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah I see
[2015/10/15 17:18:44] <Karkus> Although I also doubt most that commit necrophilic acts have necrophilia
[2015/10/15 17:19:05] <Tobbi> Karkus, I know that some serial killers have necrophilic tendencies.
[2015/10/15 17:19:12] * Tobbi reads up on Necrophilia.
[2015/10/15 17:19:24] * Karkus is afraid of the NSA
[2015/10/15 17:19:25] <Karkus> :P
[2015/10/15 17:20:38] <Tobbi> Karkus, Do you know VSauce?
[2015/10/15 17:20:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: I do.
[2015/10/15 17:21:05] <Tobbi> Karkus, They had an episode on "Morbid Curiosity"
[2015/10/15 17:21:12] <Tobbi> It's quite interesting
[2015/10/15 17:21:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: I think I've seen it
[2015/10/15 17:21:59] <Tobbi> :-)
[2015/10/15 17:23:04] <Tobbi> Karkus, I believe when head 8 debian gets back, he'll be mad at us for disregarding any social conduct when it comes to choosing our topic... :D
[2015/10/15 17:23:12] <Tobbi> *topics
[2015/10/15 17:23:19] <Tobbi> So, maybe we should take this to PM
[2015/10/15 17:29:24] <Tobbi> Karkus, Okay, let's get back to saner topics?
[2015/10/15 17:29:52] <Tobbi> Enough dark things for today :-)
[2015/10/15 17:30:03] <Karkus> I guess :)
[2015/10/15 17:31:49] <Tobbi> Karkus, Do you have CS at high school?
[2015/10/15 17:31:56] <Tobbi> computer science, I mean.
[2015/10/15 17:32:33] <head8debian> Tobbi: WHat shall i be mad at?
[2015/10/15 17:32:54] <Tobbi> head8debian, Us talking about...dark topics...
[2015/10/15 17:33:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yes
[2015/10/15 17:33:16] <Tobbi> Karkus, What do you do there?
[2015/10/15 17:33:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: not much.
[2015/10/15 17:33:40] <Tobbi> hah, sounds like our computer science courses...
[2015/10/15 17:33:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, i will stay out of it...
[2015/10/15 17:33:46] <Tobbi> Our high school courses anyway...
[2015/10/15 17:33:49] <head8debian> :p
[2015/10/15 17:33:55] <Tobbi> head8debian, Sorry, I meant "We used to"
[2015/10/15 17:34:11] <head8debian> And you say you dont want to sit on the computer all day. Youve been in IRC all day. :p
[2015/10/15 17:34:12] <Tobbi> Karkus, We started programming in Delphi.
[2015/10/15 17:34:25] <Tobbi> head8debian, I'm not sitting on the computer...
[2015/10/15 17:34:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: My teacher says it's easy (which it is) but on top of that I know it all :P
[2015/10/15 17:34:36] <Tobbi> If I did that, the screen would break.
[2015/10/15 17:34:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: Delphi
[2015/10/15 17:34:45] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/15 17:34:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: Touchscreen?
[2015/10/15 17:34:58] <Tobbi> :D no
[2015/10/15 17:35:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: Thats why you own a desktop...
[2015/10/15 17:35:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: We use python
[2015/10/15 17:35:44] <head8debian> You *can* sit on it.  :D
[2015/10/15 17:35:53] <Tobbi> Karkus, At least more useful than Delphi nowadays...
[2015/10/15 17:36:08] <Karkus> I don't think that's the primary purpose of computers.
[2015/10/15 17:36:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: I have never heard of Delphi :)
[2015/10/15 17:36:38] <Karkus> :P
[2015/10/15 17:36:50] <Tobbi> Karkus, Be glad. The language is schmandig.
[2015/10/15 17:37:23] <Karkus> schmandig?
[2015/10/15 17:37:30] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/15 17:37:44] <Tobbi> Karkus, "disgusting"
[2015/10/15 17:38:08] <Karkus> Right.
[2015/10/15 17:38:14] <Tobbi> Karkus, I even learned NSIS at times... to create installers...
[2015/10/15 17:38:20] <Tobbi> That was fun.
[2015/10/15 17:38:20] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/15 17:38:50] <Karkus> Windows! Bah!
[2015/10/15 17:38:56] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/15 17:39:15] <Karkus> We use debian even at school
[2015/10/15 17:39:34] <Karkus> What do you use at college?
[2015/10/15 17:40:42] <Tobbi> Karkus, We have machines with Windows and Mac, mostly.
[2015/10/15 17:40:50] <Tobbi> But there are linux distros for security things as well.
[2015/10/15 17:41:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Linux is undeniably the best for programming. Home or office work, however, is a different matter.
[2015/10/15 17:41:44] <Karkus> IMO
[2015/10/15 17:41:52] * Karkus adds carefully
[2015/10/15 17:42:22] <Tobbi> Karkus, I only used Windows until I was given a Mac during my internship :P
[2015/10/15 17:42:30] <Tobbi> Notice I wanna make you envious? :D
[2015/10/15 17:42:46] <Karkus> Tobbi: Not in the slightest ;)

[2015/10/15 17:43:55] <Tobbi> And every intern was allowed to keep it.
[2015/10/15 17:44:23] <Karkus> How much does it cost?
[2015/10/15 17:45:20] <Tobbi> Karkus, I actually don't know...
[2015/10/15 17:45:44] <Karkus> Tobbi: In that case, that was a rhetorical question.
[2015/10/15 17:45:57] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/10/15 17:46:12] <Tobbi> Karkus, In terms of benefits, Mozilla was top-notch.
[2015/10/15 17:46:22] <Tobbi> I could tell various details to people I want to make envious.

[2015/10/15 17:49:03] <Tobbi> So, no, I don't want to make you envious.
[2015/10/15 17:49:06] <Tobbi> :-)
[2015/10/15 17:50:04] <Karkus> I'm envious of leyyin's internship :P
[2015/10/15 17:50:31] <Tobbi> Karkus, Believe me or not, even Google has their disadvantages. :D
[2015/10/15 17:50:41] <Tobbi> Same for every other computer software company...
[2015/10/15 17:50:58] <Karkus> I'm pretty sure everything has disadvantages, Tobbi
[2015/10/15 17:51:09] <Tobbi> Karkus, Benefits are systematic so they want you to spend more time at work...
[2015/10/15 17:51:15] <Tobbi> So, you're in a golden cage, somewhat.
[2015/10/15 17:51:19] <Karkus> True dat
[2015/10/15 17:51:57] <Karkus> There is no freedom nowadays, really. Capitalism doesn't really like freedom...
[2015/10/15 17:51:58] <Tobbi> Karkus, Also, if I worked for google, I would spend a long time compulsively thinking about it...
[2015/10/15 17:52:07] <Tobbi> => I wouldn't be happy.
[2015/10/15 17:52:21] <Tobbi> Even after that headhunter sent me an e-mail, I was so excited I barely slept :P
[2015/10/15 17:52:33] <Tobbi> Well, okay, that's exaggerating things...
[2015/10/15 17:52:35] <Tobbi> but you get the idea...
[2015/10/15 17:52:45] <Karkus> Tobbi: I know what you mean
[2015/10/15 17:53:26] <Karkus> Tobbi: One day I might have dreamed of being a google employee, but now idk what I think of it
[2015/10/15 17:53:32] <Tobbi> Karkus, Besides, at Mozilla, I worked even on the weekends...because I wanted to make a good impression. It ruined it.
[2015/10/15 17:54:19] <Tobbi> Karkus, I am the same. I believe, I should just calm myself down, telling me that I could be a google employee if I really wanted to.
[2015/10/15 17:54:36] <Tobbi> And that will help my low self-esteem, and I will be calm and everything..
[2015/10/15 17:55:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: Low self-esteem is not good, but high self-esteem is even worse :D
[2015/10/15 17:55:27] <Tobbi> Karkus, I believe it depends. My expectations are too high, I guess.
[2015/10/15 17:57:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: You don't have to achieve your expectations to have a higher self esteem, you just have to appreciate what you've already done.

[2015/10/15 17:57:57] <Tobbi> head8debian, Who gave you that?
[2015/10/15 17:58:02] <head8debian> Its called once expensive still expensive old junk.
[2015/10/15 17:58:18] <head8debian> I honestly dont know if it can outdo yours. ;)
[2015/10/15 17:58:20] <head8debian> A friend.
[2015/10/15 17:58:32] <Karkus> I think overclocking a raspberry pi might make it better than my laptop :'(
[2015/10/15 17:58:40] <head8debian> Heh.
[2015/10/15 17:58:48] <head8debian> The new RPI is pretty impressive.
[2015/10/15 17:58:55] <head8debian> It could outdo my old machine.
[2015/10/15 17:59:02] <head8debian> Except a ARM processor is wimpy.

[2015/10/15 18:15:19] <Tobbi> Actually...
[2015/10/15 18:15:25] <Tobbi> never mind, that is dark comedy :D
[2015/10/15 18:15:29] <Tobbi> kind of at least.
[2015/10/15 18:15:55] <Karkus> kind of?
[2015/10/15 18:16:01] <Tobbi> nvm

[2015/10/15 22:49:55] <Mathnerd314> yeah, ctrl-down. it's temporary invincibility with the caveat that you can't move (at all)

[2015/10/16 10:53:41] <Hume2> head8debian: You have to edit the repository.nfo too.
[2015/10/16 10:54:11] <Hume2> You can also put the levelset into .supertux2/levels and it works too.

[2015/10/16 18:24:52] <datahead8888> Hmmm, the earth flower sounds a bit like the Tanooki suit from Super Mario Bros 3
[2015/10/16 18:25:13] <datahead8888> That actually was a nice power up in that game, especially when you used the statue form to crush enemies that couldn't otherwise be defeated
[2015/10/16 18:25:33] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/10/16 18:25:37] <datahead8888> I always liked the hammer bros suit in that game
[2015/10/16 18:25:50] <datahead8888> That was my favorite suit (and probably was yet another contributing factor in making it my favorite game)
[2015/10/16 18:26:08] <datahead8888> Hammers could defeat enemies that you almost never could defeat otherwise (unless you had a star)
[2015/10/16 18:26:30] <datahead8888> That's a good design tenet - have some enemies who you almost never can kill until you have something very special
[2015/10/16 18:27:15] <datahead8888> If you have some of these enemies together in a certain type of level (ie SMB3 fortress level), it is a lot of fun when you finally have the special power up

[2015/10/17 07:25:11] <Hume2> Tobbi: well, then.
[2015/10/17 07:25:17] <Hume2> May I ask why?
[2015/10/17 07:25:52] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/10/17 07:26:07] <Tobbi> Hume2: Actually, I will have to think about that...
[2015/10/17 07:26:20] <Hume2> OK
[2015/10/17 07:26:53] <mt> btw, there are some old levels in the world2 dir that could probably be removed (e.g. underconstruction.stl)
[2015/10/17 07:27:04] <Hume2> Yes, I agree.
[2015/10/17 07:27:23] <Hume2> I don't know how, but there's one level from LMH's addon.
[2015/10/17 07:27:40] <Hume2> Let's use the blame tool.

[2015/10/17 07:30:05] <Hume2> Anyway I think that some of those crappy levels from world2 have a perspective.
[2015/10/17 07:30:34] <Hume2> For example "Roots, woody roots", "UnNamed" or "Green Hills".

[2015/10/17 07:56:00] <Tobbi> Wait, no.
[2015/10/17 07:56:01] <Hume2> I closed it.
[2015/10/17 07:56:02] <Tobbi> Hume2: No.,
[2015/10/17 07:56:09] <Tobbi> Hume2: It's about an ambient sound effect.
[2015/10/17 07:56:27] <Hume2> Oh, and what does it mean?
[2015/10/17 07:56:48] <Tobbi> Hume2: So, when you're up high, there should be the sound of some wind blowing.
[2015/10/17 07:57:01] <Hume2> I'll reopent it then.
[2015/10/17 07:57:08] <Tobbi> Or that wind sound could be used for other reasons as well.
[2015/10/17 08:00:33] <Hume2> Agreed.

[2015/10/17 08:05:14] <Tobbi> But doesn't matter :D
[2015/10/17 08:05:45] <Tobbi> Oh god, I misspelled hole as "whole" :D

[2015/10/17 08:06:57] <Hume2> Never mind, I got what it means.
[2015/10/17 08:07:09] <Tobbi> Hume2: I guess we can close it.

[2015/10/17 09:35:24] <Tobbi> Hume2: What do you think?
[2015/10/17 09:35:40] <Tobbi> re. wind sound.
[2015/10/17 09:35:57] <Hume2> Tobbi: I think it's good, but I can still not implement it.
[2015/10/17 09:36:07] <Hume2> It's just hardly audible.
[2015/10/17 09:36:17] <Tobbi> Hume2: I know, it's supposed to be ambient ;)
[2015/10/17 09:36:30] <Hume2> Even when I amplified it.
[2015/10/17 09:36:35] <Tobbi> I will probably ogg encode it and add it when there's wind...
[2015/10/17 09:36:37] <Tobbi> weird.
[2015/10/17 09:36:53] <Hume2> I've already done it.
[2015/10/17 09:37:07] <Hume2> ...because SuperTux couldn't load it like this.
[2015/10/17 09:37:58] <Tobbi> Hume2: Ah, okay...
[2015/10/17 09:38:17] <Hume2> And the winds in the level "Wind test" interfere, so it produces a weird sound.
[2015/10/17 09:38:40] <Tobbi> Hume2: Problem is that the wind also gradually increases in volume.
[2015/10/17 09:38:42] <Tobbi> Which is not good.
[2015/10/17 09:38:48] <Tobbi> So maybe we should look for a better sound.
[2015/10/17 09:38:55] <Tobbi> check freesound.org and I will, too.
[2015/10/17 09:44:57] <Tobbi> Hume2: this? http://www.freesound.org/people/Anton/sounds/2690/
[2015/10/17 09:45:53] <Hume2> Tobbi: Could be, but wait, I got an idea.
[2015/10/17 09:45:57] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/10/17 09:48:10] <Tobbi> Or this: http://www.freesound.org/people/ERH/sounds/34338/
[2015/10/17 09:56:58] <Tobbi> Actually, that's CC-BY-NC, which might be incompatible with the GPL
[2015/10/17 09:58:16] <Hume2> Tobbi: I got that when I make a noise in Audacity, it makes the same and it's continuous.
[2015/10/17 09:58:35] <Hume2> ...but this doesn't fix that problem anyway.
[2015/10/17 09:58:47] <Tobbi> Hume2: Did you test the other file I linked to?
[2015/10/17 09:58:54] <Tobbi> http://www.freesound.org/people/Anton/sounds/2690/
[2015/10/17 09:59:35] <Hume2> It doesn't seem to depend on the sound.
[2015/10/17 09:59:49] <Tobbi> Hume2: Doesn't matter, the one above seems to be a loop.
[2015/10/17 10:05:14] <Hume2> It's interresting that I can hear the wind in the wind test, but not in the level "Three sheets to the wind".

[2015/10/17 10:10:24] <Tobbi> No problem.
[2015/10/17 10:10:50] <Tobbi> So, I am trying to add the wind to the cloud particle system. Not sure if it works...

[2015/10/17 10:33:07] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/17 10:33:12] <Tobbi> I believe this might be hard...
[2015/10/17 10:33:19] <Tobbi> Hume2: Of course, you can give it a shot.

[2015/10/17 12:25:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: In principle it's an interesting idea. Having a boss in forest world as well...
[2015/10/17 12:25:13] <Tobbi> But...the graphics...
[2015/10/17 12:29:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes, yes...
[2015/10/17 12:29:56] <head8debian> SOmeone else was supposably working on the graphicd, but i havent heard from him in a while...
[2015/10/17 12:30:04] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/10/17 12:33:51] <Mathnerd314> Tobbi: "what did the fox say" has been stuck in my head for the past days; I blame you
[2015/10/17 12:34:13] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: Uh, I'm sorry? :P You didn't know that song before?
[2015/10/17 12:35:06] <Mathnerd314> no, I had never heard of it. so I (foolishly) listened to it on YouTube...
[2015/10/17 12:35:32] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/10/17 12:35:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/17 12:37:57] <head8debian> Mathnerd314: LOL. :D
[2015/10/17 12:42:13] <Mathnerd314> Tobbi: so, I think you should provide some more songs; with any luck, one of them will get rid of the fox

[2015/10/17 12:45:52] <Tobbi> Hume2: Also, please create a better ghosttree image.
[2015/10/17 12:45:57] <Hume2> Tobbi: It's on the old wiki.

[2015/10/17 12:49:51] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: Is Axel F better than "What does the fox say?" :P
[2015/10/17 12:50:28] <Hume2> Tobbi: Well, I didn't find it. Maybe I just thought it myself.
[2015/10/17 12:50:42] <Tobbi> Hume2: No, it's alright, Mathnerd314 provided the answer already...
[2015/10/17 12:50:47] <Tobbi> So, yeah, let's keep it.
[2015/10/17 12:51:02] <Tobbi> Hume2: But still, ghosttree and even kugelblitz need better graphics.
[2015/10/17 12:51:52] <Hume2> I'll try to make some better. Actually, I like the ghosttree as it's now.
[2015/10/17 12:51:52] <Mathnerd314> Tobbi: well, that song has no lyrics, so it does not occupy the same genre; it did not get rid of the fox :-/

[2015/10/17 12:54:26] <Mathnerd314> Tobbi: lol. I think that will work. we'll see.

[2015/10/17 15:03:24] <Tobbi> Hume2: I don't know... But thankfully, there are GUIs available.
[2015/10/17 15:03:52] <Tobbi> Hume2: Also, please recreate the tree sprite instead of applying fancy filters to it...
[2015/10/17 15:04:00] <Tobbi> How do you imagine a ghost tree?
[2015/10/17 15:04:34] <Hume2> Tobbi: I know that it cold be strange for you, but exactly as it was in SuperTux.
[2015/10/17 15:04:42] <Tobbi> Hmm, okay...
[2015/10/17 15:04:55] <Tobbi> It's not exactly strange...
[2015/10/17 15:05:03] <Hume2> And it's not just a filter.
[2015/10/17 15:05:20] <mt> re git CLI/GUI: the problem with GUIs is they're oversimplifying everything (rebase (heck, even amend) doesn't exist in most of them)

[2015/10/17 15:10:57] <Tobbi> Filters really don't help IMO
[2015/10/17 15:11:28] <Tobbi> Hume2: Or do you have a graphics tablet and drawing skills? ;)
[2015/10/17 15:11:58] <Hume2> Tobbi: No, I don't. I draw only by mouse.
[2015/10/17 15:12:02] <Tobbi> hmm, ok
[2015/10/17 15:12:06] <Tobbi> same here
[2015/10/17 15:12:12] <Tobbi> My drawing skills are not really good for anything.
[2015/10/17 15:13:55] <Hume2> Wee need some kind of Grumbel, or whoever did it.
[2015/10/17 15:14:16] <Tobbi> yeah,,,
[2015/10/17 15:14:56] <Hume2> Other thing is that we need a forest jumpy sprite.
[2015/10/17 15:18:04] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yeah, I didn't know it wasn't a forest badguy...
[2015/10/17 15:18:12] <Tobbi> Until it started to melt...
[2015/10/17 15:19:04] <Hume2> Tobbi: It wasn't since 0.3.3.
[2015/10/17 15:19:13] <Hume2> I mean the snowjumpy.
[2015/10/17 15:20:00] <Hume2> The old jumpy sprite should just fall under the screen AFAIK.
[2015/10/17 15:21:21] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/10/17 15:21:24] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/10/17 15:22:15] <LMH> Morning, it sure seems like there is a lot more activity here these days.  Good to see.
[2015/10/17 15:23:13] <LMH> Tobbi: I prefer the idea of making language packs separate from individual addons.
[2015/10/17 15:23:58] <Tobbi> LMH: I created a new branch with the initial work, however, it seems the po file is not picked up by the game for some reason.
[2015/10/17 15:24:03] <LMH> Otherwise we're going to be constantly updating addons giving people the impression that the content is changing under the new versioning system
[2015/10/17 15:24:40] <Tobbi> LMH: On the other hand, at least localization works for add-ons, since we're now picking up the po files inside the add-ons repository, since a very recent revision.
[2015/10/17 15:25:21] <head8debian> Hello LMH.
[2015/10/17 15:25:26] <LMH> Tobbi: that's good to hear
[2015/10/17 15:25:41] <LMH> hello head8debian
[2015/10/17 15:25:45] <head8debian> Tobbi Hume2 And im not better with graphics than you 2. I also don't enjoy making them.
[2015/10/17 15:26:00] <head8debian> LMH: Nice seeing you again. :)
[2015/10/17 15:26:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: I know... It was just a small joke...
[2015/10/17 15:26:13] <Tobbi> Okay, a bad one, anyway...
[2015/10/17 15:27:10] <LMH> head8debian: likewise :)
[2015/10/17 15:28:47] <Tobbi> LMH: So, I am working on language add-ons in a new branch. Small foundation is set by this: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commit/9a1046b8513dca69b5536d43b192a3bc4be4413d
[2015/10/17 15:29:09] <Tobbi> Hume2: If you can take a look as well, that would be beneficial.
[2015/10/17 15:30:00] <Tobbi> I might add an example language pack to add-ons (0.4.0 index) and see how that behaves...
[2015/10/17 15:30:20] <Tobbi> For some reason, as far as I know, it's not picked up by the game, though.
[2015/10/17 15:34:48] <LMH> Tobbi: well since we have had issues with addons and localization in the past, it doesn't necessarily surprise me.  What if we made it simpler: keep a single .po file per language kept on either the addon repo or a new localization repo.  Whenever a new language is selected, the file is then downloaded for use.  Having all these .po files all over the
[2015/10/17 15:34:49] <LMH> filesystem has gotten rather messy.
[2015/10/17 15:35:54] <Tobbi> LMH: I don't know if transifex supports downloading the strings in a single po file.
[2015/10/17 15:38:00] <LMH> Tobbi: do we even know if a single po file would work?  Personally I like the idea, but I'm not sure 100% how the localization works.
[2015/10/17 15:39:26] <Tobbi> LMH: As far as I understand it, we can as well have multiple po files (one for each add-on). We just need to add the absolute or relative paths to the tinygettext search path.
[2015/10/17 15:39:49] <Tobbi> afaik, since a recent revision, only a single dictionary is used internally and the strings are just being added.
[2015/10/17 15:44:13] <LMH> Tobbi: do you mean to say that we're currently just using one po file?  Or is it that the single dictionary generates multiple po files?  Again, I'm not highly familiar with how this all works.
[2015/10/17 15:44:44] <Tobbi> LMH: It means that each po file is parsed and the translations added to a single "database" of some sort.
[2015/10/17 15:44:55] <Tobbi> As opposed to having multiple databases as it was before.
[2015/10/17 15:46:27] <Hume2> I think that the addon should behave the same as any other levelset.
[2015/10/17 15:46:44] @ Quit: MMlosh: Quit: Bye...
[2015/10/17 15:47:16] <Tobbi> LMH: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commit/4498b3af9907b76077bc0f3b8a4e0b7e39b5a70e
[2015/10/17 15:48:42] <LMH> Tobbi: oh, ok well that sure is an improvement
[2015/10/17 15:49:07] <Tobbi> And based upon that I could easily enter the path to each individual add-on there and fetch the po files and add them to the game.
[2015/10/17 15:49:24] <Tobbi> So, we only need to figure out why the "language add-ons" aren't working even though they should.
[2015/10/17 15:50:05] <Hume2> It's strange, but it works for me.
[2015/10/17 15:50:13] <Tobbi> Hume2: What works for you?
[2015/10/17 15:50:21] <LMH> Right.  I still like the idea of consolidating all the po files, but I suppose it doesn't really matter much.
[2015/10/17 15:50:31] <Hume2> Tobbi: translations in Narreland.
[2015/10/17 15:50:43] <Tobbi> Hume2: Of course it does, since the translation files are bundled with the add-on.
[2015/10/17 15:51:19] <Tobbi> ...and that is what I fixed.
[2015/10/17 15:51:21] <Tobbi> parsing them, etc.
[2015/10/17 15:51:54] <Hume2> So the problem is how to put them into separate addon. Right?
[2015/10/17 15:52:45] <LMH> Hume2: the reason it would be best to treat the addons differently is that every time there is a language update for an addon, it will get flagged as a new update by the addon manager, which gives players a false impression about the actual gameplay of the addon.  Plus it's more of a pain to manage.
[2015/10/17 15:53:14] <Hume2> Oh, yes. Now I get it.
[2015/10/17 15:53:39] <Tobbi> Well, we still got two months before the release...
[2015/10/17 15:53:41] <Tobbi> Let's get to it.
[2015/10/17 15:54:08] <Tobbi> LMH: Could you get the current language files from transifex for this?
[2015/10/17 15:54:21] <Tobbi> LMH: Or, even better, give me admin privileges on transifex so that I can get them myself?
[2015/10/17 15:55:39] <Hume2> Want to see something LOLious? https://github.com/joserebelo/supertux/commit/5a8db3990b3ac0af6dc2cd6b113be3dfae018bde

[2015/10/17 15:57:06] <Hume2> Tobbi: It's a commit in someone's branch.
[2015/10/17 15:57:22] <Tobbi> Hume2: Sounds just like applying modeling to supertux.
[2015/10/17 15:57:25] <Tobbi> Sounds good.
[2015/10/17 15:58:42] <LMH> Tobbi: I'll see what I can do, I don't work much with transifex, but I did insist that giby give me access in case he fell off the face of the planet.  Seems like I should do the same if able.
[2015/10/17 16:00:08] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/10/17 16:01:23] <Tobbi> Hume2: In theory, it should work: Download add-on, add add-on's path to tinygettext, parse dictionary, add contents to global dictionary...
[2015/10/17 16:01:26] <Tobbi> But it doesn't...
[2015/10/17 16:02:34] <Hume2> I see.
[2015/10/17 16:03:00] <Tobbi> let's see...

[2015/10/17 16:07:04] <LMH> Tobbi: do you have a transifex user name?  If not, is there an email I can use to set you as a maintainer?
[2015/10/17 16:07:48] <Tobbi> LMH: My transifex username is tobbi
[2015/10/17 16:10:48] <Tobbi> Thanks, that worked.
[2015/10/17 16:11:18] <LMH> Tobbi: nice and easy, ok.  I should have you added as a maintainer.  If I recall, it is kind of a pain to pull all the translations off, but it has been a while since I was forced to work with it.
[2015/10/17 16:11:42] <Tobbi> LMH: giby should know how to do it. I'll ask him, even though he's fairly busy...
[2015/10/17 16:12:29] <LMH> Tobbi: I don't think it's hard at all, but it is kind of clunky.
[2015/10/17 16:14:44] <Tobbi> Alright, I'll just see what I can do.
[2015/10/17 16:21:59] <Tobbi> We could actually use the auto-update function.
[2015/10/17 16:22:28] <Tobbi> of transifex I mean...

[2015/10/17 17:37:17] <leper`> Tobbi: You can set transifex to pull pot files from some publically accesible path (eg somewhere in your repo) and it'll fetch those and update to it for translators every day
[2015/10/17 17:37:35] <Tobbi> leper`: That sounds good...
[2015/10/17 17:37:49] <Tobbi> I just wonder whether we have that path or if giby creates the po files by hand...
[2015/10/17 17:37:58] <leper`> (ah the pos
[2015/10/17 17:38:06] <leper`> we do have a few scripts for all of that)
[2015/10/17 17:38:47] <leper`> http://trac.wildfiregames.com/browser/ps/trunk/source/tools/i18n
[2015/10/17 17:38:59] <leper`> mostly pullTranslations.py (which needs the transifex client, but well)
[2015/10/17 17:39:31] <Tobbi> leper`: I don't actually handle translation. Most of it does giby.
[2015/10/17 17:39:38] <Tobbi> So I really don't know how all that works.
[2015/10/17 17:39:47] <leper`> updateTemplates.py is used to generate the pot files from our data and source
[2015/10/17 17:40:19] <leper`> so it is possibly to automate that nicely
[2015/10/17 17:40:40] <leper`> *possible
[2015/10/17 17:40:59] <Tobbi> leper`: By the way: When will alpha 19 be released?
[2015/10/17 17:41:59] <leper`> when a few release blockers are fixed
[2015/10/17 17:42:08] <Tobbi> Ah, okay...
[2015/10/17 17:42:13] <leper`> currently pathfinding is quite broken from what I've heard
[2015/10/17 17:42:58] <leper`> (and quite some of us are quite busy currently, so the bug search isn't going as fast as it could)

[2015/10/18 05:36:18] <mt> The best thing would be to close the PR and re-open a clean one >_> (what does it actually change, GitHub thinks the .stl is a 3D model and doesn't display diffs)
[2015/10/18 05:37:02] <Tobbi> mt: Why does Github think that? We should ask them to display those as text in this repo.
[2015/10/18 05:37:04] <Tobbi> (if they can)
[2015/10/18 05:39:02] <mt> .stl is a common binary CAD file format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29), and apparently it does check the file ending, not the content
[2015/10/18 05:39:28] <mt> they should probably check if it's a binary or a text file and then decide to display diffs or not

[2015/10/18 06:44:14] <Hume2> I don't know what happens.
[2015/10/18 06:44:47] <mt> for some reason the travis jobs were cancelled and restarted
[2015/10/18 06:44:56] <Hume2> I forgot [ci skip], so I tried to stop it manually.
[2015/10/18 06:45:42] <Hume2> ...but I failed.
[2015/10/18 06:46:26] <Tobbi> help!

[2015/10/18 13:48:56] <head8debian> hehe.
[2015/10/18 13:50:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: If brmbrmcar comes here, please give him a little tour on git.
[2015/10/18 13:52:40] <Karkus> What kezboard layout were you using?
[2015/10/18 13:52:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I'm basically switching between German and American US keyboard layout all the time.
[2015/10/18 13:53:11] <Tobbi> Because this is an American Macbook and I sometimes need the umlauts.
[2015/10/18 13:53:34] <Karkus> How do you type umlauts on the german keyboard?
[2015/10/18 13:53:58] <Karkus> I hate the American one because I'm used to the British one
[2015/10/18 13:53:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: They are next to the p and the l.
[2015/10/18 13:54:06] <Tobbi> Is there a difference?
[2015/10/18 13:54:11] <Tobbi> öäü
[2015/10/18 13:54:15] <Tobbi> ß
[2015/10/18 13:54:18] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/18 13:54:20] <Tobbi> ß!
[2015/10/18 13:54:34] <Karkus> Only in symbols
[2015/10/18 13:55:06] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/10/18 13:55:35] <Karkus> As in, @ and " are switched
[2015/10/18 13:55:44] <Tobbi> Ah, Alt+S is ß in the English layout.
[2015/10/18 13:56:26] <Karkus> But others are all over the place so trying to use ampersands and the pipe symbol means I have to try every key :P
[2015/10/18 13:56:27] <Tobbi> Now, I only need to find the umlauts in the US layout.
[2015/10/18 13:56:33] <Tobbi> hehe.
[2015/10/18 13:56:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: o_O
[2015/10/18 13:56:43] <Tobbi> Pipe symbol is easy on the US one...
[2015/10/18 13:56:50] <Karkus> Where?
[2015/10/18 13:56:50] <Tobbi> head8debian: what?

[2015/10/18 13:57:35] <Karkus> so confusing

[2015/10/18 14:01:21] <Tobbi> Same here.
[2015/10/18 14:01:33] <Karkus> also its vs it's
[2015/10/18 14:01:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: But it's good that you're learning DOM calls.
[2015/10/18 14:02:01] <Karkus> What's this?
[2015/10/18 14:02:09] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/10/18 14:02:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: You know: JavaScript to manipulate the HTML tree (DOM) and other things.
[2015/10/18 14:02:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: JavaScript is my second name.
[2015/10/18 14:02:54] <Karkus> Yes, but where's this code from?
[2015/10/18 14:03:06] <Karkus> Tobbi: That would be interesting
[2015/10/18 14:03:16] <Tobbi> Karkus: I just wrote it myself...I know JS by heart.
[2015/10/18 14:03:19] <Tobbi> Pretty much.
[2015/10/18 14:03:27] <Tobbi> I don't know all these fancy JS 1.8 stuff, though.
[2015/10/18 14:03:29] <Tobbi> yield...
[2015/10/18 14:03:35] <Tobbi> Wait, I know what yield does.
[2015/10/18 14:03:42] <Karkus> there's yield in python
[2015/10/18 14:03:45] <Tobbi> But it seems weird to me...
[2015/10/18 14:03:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: It returns a value without actually leaving the function?
[2015/10/18 14:03:59] <Karkus> I barely know javascript at all
[2015/10/18 14:04:02] <head8debian> And i know nothing about JS. :D
[2015/10/18 14:04:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: In python it creates a generator
[2015/10/18 14:04:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: JavaScript is fun. It's much easier to integrate a mole into a waffler that way.
[2015/10/18 14:04:21] <Karkus> I think...
[2015/10/18 14:04:24] <Tobbi> Ah, okay...
[2015/10/18 14:04:49] <Tobbi> Who wouldn't want a mole integrated into a waffler, anyway?
[2015/10/18 14:05:06] <Karkus> It's really confusing because you have to have a loop and then it misses the code outside or something...
[2015/10/18 14:05:39] <Karkus> I just use (i*i for i in range(100))
[2015/10/18 14:05:43] <Tobbi> I barely know Python. I know enough how programming works that I can cope with python, but all those fancy things...
[2015/10/18 14:06:01] <Tobbi> That for example...I know what it does, but I would never write it that way :D
[2015/10/18 14:06:09] <Karkus> lambda is another one that confuses me
[2015/10/18 14:06:15] <Karkus> but I understand it

[2015/10/18 17:04:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: really?
[2015/10/18 17:04:32] <Tobbi> Or we didn
[2015/10/18 17:04:33] <Tobbi> t
[2015/10/18 17:04:34] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/10/18 17:04:36] <giby_the_kid> I have a memory lap :p
[2015/10/18 17:04:38] <head8debian>  Yes we did!
[2015/10/18 17:04:40] <giby_the_kid> Great
[2015/10/18 17:04:46] <head8debian> This is M2. Finally.
[2015/10/18 17:04:53] <Tobbi> Karkus: Basically, I believe the game is stable enough for MS2.
[2015/10/18 17:04:54] <Karkus> But the forest world....
[2015/10/18 17:04:56] <head8debian> So it had better be good. :D
[2015/10/18 17:04:59] <Tobbi> What about it?
[2015/10/18 17:05:01] <giby_the_kid> Youpi ^_^
[2015/10/18 17:05:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: It was planned for M2
[2015/10/18 17:05:10] <head8debian> Yes, whats wrong with teh forest world as it is?
[2015/10/18 17:05:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: Forest world is fine, isn't it?
[2015/10/18 17:05:27] <Tobbi> So many levels depend on those tiles.
[2015/10/18 17:06:00] <Karkus> head8debian: Half the levels are good, some are bad, some are boring and the rest last 2 seconds and there's no boss
[2015/10/18 17:06:23] <Tobbi> Well, there is a boss, sicne hume added one.
[2015/10/18 17:06:29] <Karkus> The whole 'ghost forest' idea never really happened
[2015/10/18 17:06:34] <Karkus> Tobbi: He did?
[2015/10/18 17:06:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: *Unfortunately...Because those graphics are ugly...
[2015/10/18 17:06:54] <Tobbi> We need a better ghost tree IMO
[2015/10/18 17:07:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: The ghost tree is okay
[2015/10/18 17:07:06] <head8debian> I can +1 that.
[2015/10/18 17:07:14] <Karkus> Well whatever
[2015/10/18 17:07:15] <head8debian> ^^ Tobbi.
[2015/10/18 17:07:18] <Karkus> Where is the boss?
[2015/10/18 17:07:21] <head8debian> Bleh. :p
[2015/10/18 17:07:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: Last level in the forest...
[2015/10/18 17:07:30] <Tobbi> At the very end...
[2015/10/18 17:07:32] <Karkus> In the castle?
[2015/10/18 17:07:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: yeah.
[2015/10/18 17:07:37] <giby_the_kid> The boss Tree is ugly
[2015/10/18 17:07:43] <Karkus> I couldnt find it?
[2015/10/18 17:07:55] <Karkus> When was it added?
[2015/10/18 17:08:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: very very recently.
[2015/10/18 17:08:03] <Tobbi> Let me check.
[2015/10/18 17:08:08] <Karkus> ah.
[2015/10/18 17:08:17] <Tobbi> 2 days ago.
[2015/10/18 17:08:24] <Karkus> Oh.
[2015/10/18 17:08:25] <Tobbi> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commit/683ddac6bbf3f2b71231032cbd789c3ce0c958f0
[2015/10/18 17:09:49] <Tobbi> Is this okay for everyone, by the way? https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commit/8bf39ad3c15696127c09ff038655c06f424704d7
[2015/10/18 17:10:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why wouldn't it be :P
[2015/10/18 17:10:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sure.
[2015/10/18 17:10:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't know? I have to admit that I'm really careful with changes... :D
[2015/10/18 17:11:04] <Tobbi> And I'm reluctant to change graphics and ingame mechanics...
[2015/10/18 17:11:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: Far better safe than sorry
[2015/10/18 17:11:09] <Tobbi> But, yeah.
[2015/10/18 17:11:13] <Tobbi> Indeedd.
[2015/10/18 17:11:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do you ever see unexpected idioms?
[2015/10/18 17:11:51] <Tobbi> Karkus: ...like?
[2015/10/18 17:12:01] <head8debian> Wish Hume was that way... in some ways...
[2015/10/18 17:12:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?
[2015/10/18 17:12:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: Ah, of course.
[2015/10/18 17:12:46] <Karkus> Tobbi: Not the best example, as it's very literal
[2015/10/18 17:12:55] <Tobbi> Besser ein Spatz in der Hand als eine Taube auf dem Dach"
[2015/10/18 17:13:02] <Tobbi> That's the german way to describe it.
[2015/10/18 17:13:26] <Karkus> Well
[2015/10/18 17:13:43] <Tobbi> Better a sparrow in the hand than a pigeon on the roof.
[2015/10/18 17:13:46] <Karkus> I'm not suprised it's fairly similar
[2015/10/18 17:13:52] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/10/18 17:14:08] <head8debian> Heh.
[2015/10/18 17:14:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: Although: Better a sparrow in the hand than a pigeon in the hand.
[2015/10/18 17:14:45] <Tobbi> Yeah, that's for sure.
[2015/10/18 17:14:55] <Karkus> :P
[2015/10/18 17:15:08] <head8debian> Better sparrow poop in the face than pigeon poop in the face. :p
[2015/10/18 17:15:22] <head8debian> Boy, there is alot to HTML forms...
[2015/10/18 17:15:29] <head8debian> Alot to remeber that is.
[2015/10/18 17:16:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Aren't you the one sensitive about those words?
[2015/10/18 17:16:20] <Karkus> head8debian: Better sparrow poop in the face than dog poop on the shoe
[2015/10/18 17:17:09] <Karkus> Ah damn. The cheat to complete the forest worldmap doesnt give you the keys.
[2015/10/18 17:17:17] <Karkus> Not that it matters, of course

[2015/10/18 17:22:44] <Tobbi> Karkus: afaik you have to fetch at least three of the lights using the lanterns.
[2015/10/18 17:24:09] <Karkus> Hmm... I can't seem to do it...

[2015/10/19 11:00:58] <brmbrmcar> How on earth do you use this thing?
[2015/10/19 11:02:17] <Not-6fa5> [02supertux] 03Success. The Travis CI build passed - 13https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux/builds/86201295
[2015/10/19 11:04:06] <brmbrmcar> So what, success?
[2015/10/19 11:04:07] <mt> brmbrmcar: well, you should leave your browser/client open and don't hibernate your computer (that closes tcp connections)
[2015/10/19 11:04:29] <mt> That success means that your pull request passed an automated build.
[2015/10/19 11:04:38] <brmbrmcar> I didn;t hibernate. I went off. Switching operating system does nothing
[2015/10/19 11:05:07] <mt> well, switching OS requires reboot, which in turn also kills TCP connections
[2015/10/19 11:05:47] <mt> IRC is a chat protocol that requires being constantly connected to the server to receive all messages
[2015/10/19 11:07:23] <brmbrmcar> I am using crouton.

[2015/10/19 11:08:59] <mt> closing your browser also closes tcp connections, and so on. I don't know what you did, but fact is that you seem to have no idea what you're doing (on github and on IRC)
[2015/10/19 11:09:24] <brmbrmcar> I am still connected.
[2015/10/19 11:09:34] <mt> yes
[2015/10/19 11:09:53] <brmbrmcar> I know how to use this thing partially.
[2015/10/19 11:11:17] <mt> ok, so you want to talk about how to fix your pull request, I guess
[2015/10/19 11:12:14] <brmbrmcar> I've just installed git.
[2015/10/19 11:12:32] <mt> great
[2015/10/19 11:13:13] <mt> then navigate to your repository (in the command line)
[2015/10/19 11:17:20] <brmbrmcar> I am stuck
[2015/10/19 11:18:06] <mt> with?
[2015/10/19 11:18:43] <brmbrmcar> THe navigating. /.git/config doesn't exist.
[2015/10/19 11:19:56] <mt> why are you trying to access /.git/config
[2015/10/19 11:20:16] <mt> I wouldn't know any sane reason to store / in git
[2015/10/19 11:21:08] <mt> by navigating I mean changing to the directory where your supertux source tree is located in
[2015/10/19 11:22:07] <brmbrmcar> How is that done?
[2015/10/19 11:24:53] <mt> don't tell me you know how to use the command line but you somehow you can compile supertux
[2015/10/19 11:25:03] <mt> *you don't know
[2015/10/19 11:25:24] <mt> cd /path/to/directory
[2015/10/19 11:25:43] <brmbrmcar> Done.
[2015/10/19 11:27:01] <brmbrmcar> Now what?
[2015/10/19 11:29:24] <mt> pastebin git status output, please
[2015/10/19 11:29:43] <brmbrmcar> I know how to use the command line.
[2015/10/19 11:30:20] <brmbrmcar> Output of what command? It just says I am in the right place.
[2015/10/19 11:31:39] <mt> `git status`

[2015/10/19 11:35:44] <mt> ok, so, where's your fork (you should have that added as different remote - there's no actual need to keep two different clones for that)

[2015/10/19 11:38:09] <mt> well, add that as a remote
[2015/10/19 11:38:41] <mt> now would be a good time to read more about git's basic commands if you're not familiar with them

[2015/10/19 11:53:45] <mt> it would be nice to know what's the problem
[2015/10/19 11:53:55] <mt> else we can't diagnose or fix it
[2015/10/19 11:54:41] <brmbrmcar> git checkout isn;t working
[2015/10/19 11:54:56] <mt> isn't working can have many reasons
[2015/10/19 11:55:20] <brmbrmcar> Doesn;t recognise the address.
[2015/10/19 11:55:26] <mt> what address?
[2015/10/19 11:55:53] <mt> I told you to *read more* if you haven't understood it
[2015/10/19 12:03:29] <Hume2> mt: This is the worst way how you can explain. If we had enough developers, we could explain this way.
[2015/10/19 12:03:58] <Hume2> Instead of telling what should someone learn, learn it him.
[2015/10/19 12:06:09] <mt> manual pages were written for a reason, and I don't have time all day
[2015/10/19 12:07:05] <Hume2> mt: Manuals are usually hard to understand.
[2015/10/19 12:07:54] <Hume2> I guess that if he understood them, he would have had better knowledge about git.
[2015/10/19 12:08:05] <mt> yet they were - at least in the first unixes - written so unexperienced people could learn from them
[2015/10/19 12:09:52] <Hume2> mt: If you know a manual that is written like this, then give him a link.
[2015/10/19 12:10:37] <Hume2> And please don't give him the first link that you get from Google, unless you read it before.
[2015/10/19 12:11:55] <mt> the second paragraph actually refers to two nice written manuals gittutorial(7) and giteveryday(2) which give an introduction
[2015/10/19 12:12:05] <mt> second paragraph of git(1)

[2015/10/19 13:27:52] <Hume2> You have to create a branch first.
[2015/10/19 13:28:00] <brmbrmcar> So git push what?
[2015/10/19 13:28:20] <leyyin> you have to push to your fork

[2015/10/19 13:34:22] <Hume2> ... and git commit as well.
[2015/10/19 13:34:45] <brmbrmcar> That brings the same error.
[2015/10/19 13:34:57] <Hume2> What? Git commit?
[2015/10/19 13:35:45] <brmbrmcar> I now have a different error. I'llpastebin it.

[2015/10/19 13:36:26] <Hume2> So you have an error with git push. I excepted that.
[2015/10/19 13:37:11] <Hume2> What does "git branch -vv" say?

[2015/10/19 14:33:56] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/10/19 14:34:10] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar, In order to update branches, you do this: git fetch origin && git rebase origin/master
[2015/10/19 14:34:32] <Tobbi> Currently, this shouldn't do anything...since your branch is up-to-date.
[2015/10/19 14:34:42] <brmbrmcar> OK, thanks.
[2015/10/19 14:34:54] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar, Now, I believe you want to add changes, don't you?
[2015/10/19 14:35:30] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/10/19 14:35:43] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar, Okay, can you add the changes you want?
[2015/10/19 14:35:53] <Tobbi> Just add them to the files...
[2015/10/19 14:38:15] <brmbrmcar> I've lost the file. I'll just make a basic change that won't change anythingfor now.
[2015/10/19 14:38:37] <Tobbi> Okay, sounds good.
[2015/10/19 14:41:29] <Tobbi> Ready?
[2015/10/19 14:42:25] <brmbrmcar> I've actually managed to fix the shrink() function in the console. I am ready.
[2015/10/19 14:42:38] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar, What does git status tell you?
[2015/10/19 14:44:01] <brmbrmcar> Your branch is up-to-date with 'brmbrmcar/brmbrmcar'.  Changes not staged for commit:   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)          modified:   data/scripts/console.nut  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

[2015/10/19 14:53:53] <brmbrmcar> It has worked!
[2015/10/19 14:54:20] <Tobbi_> Let's check.
[2015/10/19 14:55:17] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: Congratulations. I believe we should, however, rename your branch, shouldn't we?
[2015/10/19 14:55:23] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/10/19 14:55:39] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: I don't think you can rename a branch you're currently on, so let's move to master...
[2015/10/19 14:55:41] <Tobbi_> git checkout master
[2015/10/19 14:56:19] <brmbrmcar> Didn't work.
[2015/10/19 14:56:25] <Tobbi_> Error message?
[2015/10/19 14:57:11] <brmbrmcar> Switched to branch 'master' Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
[2015/10/19 14:57:18] <brmbrmcar> It isn;t.
[2015/10/19 14:57:29] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: It is. ;)
[2015/10/19 14:57:38] <Tobbi_> Oh, wait.
[2015/10/19 14:57:45] <Tobbi_> I know where you're getting at.
[2015/10/19 14:58:10] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: We can deal with that part later.
[2015/10/19 14:58:13] <Tobbi_> one moment, please.
[2015/10/19 14:59:11] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: To rename that brmbrmcar branch: git branch -m brmbrmcar fix_shrink_function
[2015/10/19 15:00:32] <Tobbi_> Tell me when you're done.
[2015/10/19 15:01:09] <brmbrmcar> It says it's done, but it hasn't changed on the website.
[2015/10/19 15:01:32] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: I know. To do that, let's do the following:
[2015/10/19 15:01:40] <Tobbi_> git push brmbrmcar :brmbrmcar
[2015/10/19 15:01:47] <Tobbi_> git push brmbrmcar fix_shrink_function
[2015/10/19 15:03:00] <Tobbi_> Notice that the ":" in front of the branch name deletes a branch...while without a ":" it pushes a branch.
[2015/10/19 15:03:53] <brmbrmcar> Worked.
[2015/10/19 15:04:27] <Tobbi_> Okay...now you can create a pull request.

[2015/10/19 15:05:49] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: Great!
[2015/10/19 15:05:54] <Tobbi_> That seemed to have worked.

[2015/10/19 15:06:28] <brmbrmcar> It's pending Travis.
[2015/10/19 15:06:35] <Tobbi_> I know...
[2015/10/19 15:06:53] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: But we can assume that the travis build won't fail...since you never actually changed anything about the code ;)
[2015/10/19 15:08:22] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: Okay, so, do you have anything on master that you actually still need?
[2015/10/19 15:08:34] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/10/19 15:09:37] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: Okay, so we can reset it to the supertux origin.
[2015/10/19 15:09:49] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: git fetch origin && git rebase origin/master
[2015/10/19 15:10:00] <Tobbi_> Actually...
[2015/10/19 15:10:07] <Tobbi_> It should tell you that it's up-to-date.
[2015/10/19 15:10:12] <Tobbi_> But it doesn't hurt to try.
[2015/10/19 15:11:13] <Tobbi_> giby_the_kid: You're creating the po files yourself, right? You know that transifex can update the po files from a source, anyway...
[2015/10/19 15:11:38] <giby_the_kid> I use the script ;)
[2015/10/19 15:12:07] <giby_the_kid> It could from a single file... but how many single files are needed?
[2015/10/19 15:12:12] <brmbrmcar> Up todate.
[2015/10/19 15:12:18] <Tobbi_> giby_the_kid: I don't know ;)
[2015/10/19 15:12:29] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: Good. Now do this: git reset --hard origin/master
[2015/10/19 15:12:53] <giby_the_kid> well... for levels, all of them for every just one sentence ^^
[2015/10/19 15:12:54] <brmbrmcar> HEAD is now at c142556 Even less runtime errors
[2015/10/19 15:13:17] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: Okay, that's good. Now if you try to git push brmbrmcar master ?
[2015/10/19 15:13:24] <Tobbi_> It should give you an error message ;)
[2015/10/19 15:13:39] <Tobbi_> Just checking whether you did it right
[2015/10/19 15:13:59] <Tobbi_> giby_the_kid: By script you mean that python script, right?
[2015/10/19 15:14:23] <giby_the_kid> makepot.sh
[2015/10/19 15:14:27] <Tobbi_> Ah!
[2015/10/19 15:14:32] <Tobbi_> Okay, I see...
[2015/10/19 15:15:43] <brmbrmcar> It gave anerror.
[2015/10/19 15:15:52] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: Good! Exactly what I expected.
[2015/10/19 15:15:59] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: git push brmbrmcar master -f

[2015/10/19 15:17:20] <Tobbi_> Okay...let's see...
[2015/10/19 15:17:31] <Tobbi_> Yes!
[2015/10/19 15:18:07] <Tobbi_> brmbrmcar: Okay, what you should do to update your repository is the following: 1. git fetch origin 2. git rebase origin/master 3. git push brmbrmcar master
[2015/10/19 15:18:17] <Tobbi_> That's for the future, okay?
[2015/10/19 15:18:22] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/19 15:18:36] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/10/19 15:18:48] <Tobbi_> If you want to work on something new, switch to master by doing "git checkout master", then you can do git checkout -b "new_branch_name_describing_my_feature"
[2015/10/19 15:18:57] <Tobbi_> And then you change things...
[2015/10/19 15:19:10] <Tobbi_> Then you commit, like we did before, and then you push ;)
[2015/10/19 15:19:17] <Tobbi_> Okay, I believe you're now set.
[2015/10/19 15:19:26] <brmbrmcar> Thank you.

[2015/10/20 11:55:42] <Tobbi> Apparently we did.
[2015/10/20 11:56:06] <Tobbi> I joined first, according to the log.
[2015/10/20 11:56:10] <giby_the_kid> Hi Hume2
[2015/10/20 11:56:15] <Tobbi> I *really* need a break.
[2015/10/20 11:56:22] <Hume2> Hi, Giby.
[2015/10/20 11:56:31] <giby_the_kid> Hume2, I'm in Brno right now
[2015/10/20 11:56:49] <Tobbi> That looks like it's missing a vocal or two?
[2015/10/20 11:56:55] <giby_the_kid> No....
[2015/10/20 11:57:04] <Hume2> It's right.
[2015/10/20 11:57:18] <giby_the_kid> Are you far from that town?
[2015/10/20 11:57:22] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/20 11:57:34] <Hume2> 170km or something like this.
[2015/10/20 11:57:55] <Tobbi> Podebrady, according to the IP.
[2015/10/20 11:58:12] <Hume2> Tobbi: That's not true. I'm not in Poděbrady.
[2015/10/20 11:58:26] <Hume2> I don't know why is it there.
[2015/10/20 11:59:49] <giby_the_kid> Well I went through add ons... could you correct yours and ask narre to do it to? \r are not accepted
[2015/10/20 12:00:10] <Hume2> I'll go trough it.
[2015/10/20 12:03:30] <giby_the_kid> Thanks
[2015/10/20 12:05:48] <Hume2> Done.
[2015/10/20 12:09:00] <Hume2> Why do need forest levels another leveldot sprite? Isn't the colorful dor universal enough?
[2015/10/20 12:11:51] <Tobbi> Hume2: Because it's forest levels ;)
[2015/10/20 12:11:57] <Hume2> :D
[2015/10/20 12:13:39] <Hume2> Tobbi: Do you think that the coins from boxes should be counted to the level statistics as well?
[2015/10/20 12:13:59] <Tobbi> Hume2: As for that, I don't know...
[2015/10/20 12:14:07] <Tobbi> I don't think so, some boxes are just hardly reachable
[2015/10/20 12:14:19] <Tobbi> And please, no more supertux today...I am tired and fed up with college...

[2015/10/20 13:54:58] <Tobbi> Someone needs to take over...
[2015/10/20 13:55:00] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/20 13:56:04] <brmbrmcar> Take over what?
[2015/10/20 13:57:25] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Take over supertux lead.
[2015/10/20 13:58:09] <brmbrmcar> Scary!
[2015/10/20 13:58:33] <brmbrmcar> Don't let me do that.
[2015/10/20 13:59:33] <Karkus> No one is going to take it over, but that doesn't mean you can't stop doing it, Tobbi
[2015/10/20 13:59:49] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/20 13:59:51] <Tobbi> It's okay...
[2015/10/20 13:59:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: Tuesdays are hell!
[2015/10/20 14:00:19] <Karkus> Why, Tobbi?
[2015/10/20 14:00:33] <Tobbi> Karkus: Long day at college...and subjects I don't really like...
[2015/10/20 14:01:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Subjects?
[2015/10/20 14:01:14] <Karkus> You surely have only one subject?
[2015/10/20 14:01:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: Medical visualization, build management and test automation of mobile applications, mobile security.
[2015/10/20 14:02:08] <Karkus> Oh, I see
[2015/10/20 14:02:18] <brmbrmcar> Complicated...
[2015/10/20 14:02:32] <Karkus> I thought you meant Computer Science :P
[2015/10/20 14:03:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't know anything about computer science :D

[2015/10/20 14:07:00] <Karkus> :D
[2015/10/20 14:07:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, it wouldn't. I'm tired of these things...
[2015/10/20 14:07:13] <brmbrmcar> It would be awesome.
[2015/10/20 14:07:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Reason I am doing my masters is because I have the urge to advance.
[2015/10/20 14:07:29] <Tobbi> NOthing more.
[2015/10/20 14:08:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: It must be frustrating
[2015/10/20 14:08:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have to think about whether I want to continue or not.
[2015/10/20 14:08:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: What are the options for you after masters anyway?
[2015/10/20 14:09:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: a Job where I get more money...
[2015/10/20 14:09:06] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/20 14:10:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: What do you mean continue?
[2015/10/20 14:10:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: I always have the chance to quit my studies.
[2015/10/20 14:11:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah
[2015/10/20 14:12:59] <Karkus> Tobbi: You should look around for a job opportunity then, and if you find something...
[2015/10/20 14:13:21] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe I should reflect on my life so far and find something fun to do.
[2015/10/20 14:14:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: Such as?
[2015/10/20 14:14:14] <Tobbi> Karkus: Don't know? :D
[2015/10/20 14:14:20] <Tobbi> WIll take some time to figure that out, anyway.
[2015/10/20 14:14:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well surely there is something outside of computer science that you enjoy...?
[2015/10/20 14:15:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: Certainly. :)
[2015/10/20 14:15:09] <Tobbi> But I need to pay my bills as well...
[2015/10/20 14:15:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: Unfortunately :(
[2015/10/20 14:15:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, on one hand I need to pay my bills, on the other hand I want a fun job.

[2015/10/20 14:19:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do you not think you could enjoy a computer-science-involving job
[2015/10/20 14:19:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: Not anymore, personally... :)
[2015/10/20 14:20:07] <Tobbi> I can't stand thinking structured the whole day...
[2015/10/20 14:20:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: What happened?
[2015/10/20 14:20:21] <Tobbi> Karkus: I just got tired of everything...
[2015/10/20 14:21:52] <Tobbi> Karkus: What I kind of enjoy is solving problems. What I don't enjoy is all this structure, these protocols, everything that is just so damn annoying. Things I don't want to know anything about, like, for example, how bluetooth works etc
[2015/10/20 14:21:56] <Tobbi> I hate protocols.
[2015/10/20 14:22:16] <Tobbi> I never wanted to go as deep into the "how everything works" as I am now.
[2015/10/20 14:22:26] <Tobbi> I really do not care about these things.
[2015/10/20 14:22:33] <Tobbi> And I don't want to work on them...
[2015/10/20 14:23:25] <brmbrmcar> THen you shouldn't.
[2015/10/20 14:23:25] <Karkus> I would have thought there would be lots of problem solving in the computer science degree
[2015/10/20 14:23:52] <Tobbi> Karkus: Possibly...but it's all so annoying. I guess I need a break.
[2015/10/20 14:24:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: You do.
[2015/10/20 14:24:21] <Tobbi> Karkus: Problem is that I'm involved in a multitude of projects.
[2015/10/20 14:24:25] <Tobbi> Currently at least 3...
[2015/10/20 14:24:32] <Tobbi> I need to talk this through with my profs.
[2015/10/20 14:24:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: But do you need a break from computer science or life in general?
[2015/10/20 14:25:11] <Tobbi> Karkus: A break from computer science. Because I tend to get happier when I think about other interesting things I could do.
[2015/10/20 14:25:39] <Tobbi> Aka, things that are not computer science.
[2015/10/20 14:25:40] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/20 14:32:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Just enjoy yourself, and supertux will survive alone, with or without you
[2015/10/20 14:32:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know... SuperTux is fun, kind of...because I have freedom.
[2015/10/20 14:32:50] <Tobbi> I mean, okay, I have my own high expectations to meet for supertux, but that's something different... :D
[2015/10/20 14:33:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: The dev team for the actual game consists of Hume2 and yourself, so I would rethink those expectations
[2015/10/20 14:34:00] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know. But think of all this high user base we got :D
[2015/10/20 14:35:44] <Tobbi> Let's see how I best enjoy myself...
[2015/10/20 14:35:51] <Tobbi> I should possibly think about that.

[2015/10/20 16:03:33] <datahead8888> brmbrmcar, people often passively hang out in multiple rooms and come back in and say something if they see an interesting discussion or are mentioned.  It allows them to get exposure to different things while not being weighed down intensely following all IRC discussions
[2015/10/20 16:04:38] <datahead8888> I hang out in several rooms myself, but it's not possible for me to follow all the conversations.  I follow the Secret Chronicles discussion most closely and follow this room's discussion the second most closely

[2015/10/21 12:22:24] <brmbrmcar> It was a rip off as well. £14 for 16GB???
[2015/10/21 12:23:51] <brmbrmcar> Thats around €18!
[2015/10/21 12:24:15] <head8debian> Not *too* bad...
[2015/10/21 12:24:54] <brmbrmcar> €19 euros, actually.
[2015/10/21 12:25:30] <brmbrmcar> I could have got it for a fraction of the price!

[2015/10/21 12:48:31] <mt> 18:22 (head8debian) Not *too* bad... <-- you realize 19 € is about 21 US-$; so really much for an SD card
[2015/10/21 12:48:45] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I believe it's intended that the credits music loops.
[2015/10/21 12:49:32] <brmbrmcar> Why does it restart right at the very end? It is not like 0.1.3.
[2015/10/21 12:49:43] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: pure chance.
[2015/10/21 12:49:58] <mt> 0.3.x is in many ways not like 0.1.3
[2015/10/21 12:52:48] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but most people will be upgrading Milestone 2 from 0.1.3.
[2015/10/21 12:52:53] <Hume2> I think that the music should loop.
[2015/10/21 12:53:16] <Hume2> What do you suggest then? Generic infinite long music?
[2015/10/21 12:53:58] <brmbrmcar> Create a .music file. I'll see what is best and show you.

[2015/10/21 20:32:04] <datahead8888> A "Super Tux" Linux distribution would be cool
[2015/10/21 20:32:24] <datahead8888> If you added Secret Chronicles, it would be a "classic platformer distribution" :P
[2015/10/21 20:32:55] <datahead8888> I was thinking if you could add Super Tux Kart to it, but if you add all the 3D packages for that to the distrbution, it's a lot more than just what Super Tux 2D needs
[2015/10/21 20:33:25] <datahead8888> I guess it depends on whether you're focused on development tools or user geared tools
[2015/10/21 20:33:46] <datahead8888> You could also add Tux Racer and Free Droid to the distribution if it's user geared; these both have Tux themes
[2015/10/21 20:53:13] @ Quit: tux|dude: Quit: Leaving
[2015/10/21 21:27:23] <head8debian> Yes, but i have no clue on where you would begin with a distro like that.
[2015/10/21 21:27:45] <head8debian> A game should play just as good on a live cd as on a normal cd.
[2015/10/21 21:28:01] <head8debian> And there is so much you would have to support on a os...
[2015/10/21 22:02:15] <datahead8888> It'd be some work, I'm sure
[2015/10/21 22:02:19] <datahead8888> Though it would be cool
[2015/10/21 22:02:28] <datahead8888> The game certainly should be able to run without a distro like this
[2015/10/21 22:02:50] <datahead8888> lol - you could also change the default wallpaper for the distribution to have a picture of either Tux or of a Super Tux level
[2015/10/21 22:02:53] <datahead8888> Or the villain

[2015/10/22 12:19:03] <mt> brmbrmcar: you go to your git clone, make sure you've checked out your working branch (which should *not* be master), git rebase -i HEAD~5 # replace the 5 with numbers of commits you to see from the history, 5 is fine for deleting the last commit, then in the text editor git should've opened for you, find the line with the commit you want to delete, remove it, save and quit the editor. git will do the other
[2015/10/22 12:19:06] <mt> magic then (do note you can't undo this)
[2015/10/22 12:19:23] <mt> then force push
[2015/10/22 12:20:22] <mt> why did you open #196 and then opened a PR later? You can actually just submit a PR without an issue being there.
[2015/10/22 12:21:13] <mt> that said, in the commit message of the first commit (once you deleted the second you can just --amend the first), you should mention why you changed it and which issues/pull requests it closes)

[2015/10/22 13:01:47] <brmbrmcar> What are the problems?
[2015/10/22 13:02:23] <mt> 1. when someone reads "Changed SDL requirement." they might wonder why, so explain it in your commit
[2015/10/22 13:02:33] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Add the [ci skip] into the commit message to skip Travis CI build.
[2015/10/22 13:03:06] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: While you are at it, add here "fixes #196".
[2015/10/22 13:03:16] <mt> 2. when you add "Closes #196, closes #197" to the message it will auto-close these issues/pull requests
[2015/10/22 13:03:39] <Hume2> mt: "closes #197" won't work.
[2015/10/22 13:03:47] <Hume2> It works only for bugs.
[2015/10/22 13:03:48] <mt> yes it will
[2015/10/22 13:04:29] <Hume2> mt: It will close the pull request, that is not intended.
[2015/10/22 13:04:43] <mt> example: https://github.com/weechat/weechat/pull/145 https://github.com/weechat/weechat/commit/35574d63ab25d6c65c408d7ca3fdada1b44e8a4a
[2015/10/22 13:04:51] <mt> it will close the pull request once merged
[2015/10/22 13:06:09] <Hume2> mt: In that case, it has no usage here, because the pull-requests close automatically when merged.
[2015/10/22 13:06:40] <mt> when you click merge yes, when you cherry-pick/rebase non-fast-forward it won't
[2015/10/22 13:07:46] <Hume2> mt: We do it via the merge button anyway.

[2015/10/22 22:19:27] <datahead8888> I saw that the release date for milestone 2 was tentatively set for December.  Are new features still being added to Milestone 2?
[2015/10/22 22:22:30] <head8debian> datahead8888: Yes. Well, as we can.
[2015/10/22 22:22:50] <head8debian> datahead8888: We wont really have a rc1 and rc2.
[2015/10/22 22:23:37] <head8debian> We have had a beta, but alot of changes have taken place.
[2015/10/22 22:39:31] <datahead8888> If the release date is in December, you should probably freeze the code.  Otherwise the new features can introduce bugs that cause an unstable release.
[2015/10/22 22:39:52] <datahead8888> New features could go into a separate development or post-release branch, while release-milestone2 would only have bugfixes

[2015/10/23 10:46:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: Just use it. :D
[2015/10/23 10:46:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am fairly reluctant...
[2015/10/23 10:46:58] <Tobbi> I know he probably wouldn't sue us...
[2015/10/23 10:47:00] <Tobbi> but...
[2015/10/23 10:47:13] <Tobbi> This is not legal...He has to give us confirmation about what license we want to use.
[2015/10/23 10:48:13] <Tobbi> I should look at mr candle again...
[2015/10/23 10:48:18] <Tobbi> I haven't done in quite some time.
[2015/10/23 10:48:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sad that he hasn't responded. Is he in IRC?
[2015/10/23 10:48:55] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/10/23 10:48:56] <brmbrmcar> Mr Candle!
[2015/10/23 10:49:00] <Tobbi> What's his username again?
[2015/10/23 10:49:35] <Tobbi> Oh he replied 2 days ago.
[2015/10/23 10:51:56] <Tobbi> Oh, wait!
[2015/10/23 10:52:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: The theme is licensed CC-BY-SA.
[2015/10/23 10:52:20] <Tobbi> So, there's no other way but to credit him like this.
[2015/10/23 10:52:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: Besides, the sound creators should be in the credits.
[2015/10/23 10:52:40] <Tobbi> We should add them.
[2015/10/23 10:56:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: actually, I believe this could be a task for you ;)
[2015/10/23 10:56:08] <Tobbi> And this time I am not assigning you a task you can't handle.
[2015/10/23 10:57:30] <Tobbi> ;)
[2015/10/23 10:57:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, when is feature freeze? What do you say?
[2015/10/23 10:58:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't know? After you implement christmas theme?

[2015/10/23 11:30:38] <tuxdev_> huh
[2015/10/23 11:31:30] <brmbrmcar> That would mean changing Tux's directions...
[2015/10/23 11:32:18] <Tobbi> tuxdev_: Hey. Why "huh"?
[2015/10/23 11:32:34] <tuxdev_> Tobbi, just nice to see the project moving again
[2015/10/23 11:32:50] <Tobbi> tuxdev_: We have been moving for more than 2 years ;)
[2015/10/23 11:33:19] <tuxdev_> I hadn't been really paying attention for more than 2 years :p
[2015/10/23 11:33:54] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/10/23 11:34:02] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/10/23 11:34:12] <Tobbi> tuxdev_: If you want to get involved in any way, go ahead ;)
[2015/10/23 11:34:54] <Tobbi> Or should I say "again" :-)
[2015/10/23 11:35:01] <Tobbi> Since you have been involved at some point.
[2015/10/23 11:35:25] <tuxdev_> yeah
[2015/10/23 11:36:01] <tuxdev_> the big hanging thread I feel particularly responsible for is the japanese localization
[2015/10/23 11:36:24] <tuxdev_> my actual code contributions have gotten totally obliterated by the move to SDL2
[2015/10/23 11:36:35] <Tobbi> tuxdev_: We lack right-to-left support in the fonts, I believe.
[2015/10/23 11:36:57] <tuxdev_> japanese isn't right-to-left when it comes to computer stuff
[2015/10/23 11:37:04] <tuxdev_> the real issue is kanji
[2015/10/23 11:37:52] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/10/23 11:39:05] <tuxdev_> I think I was working on some fallback utf8 font render so that there'd be something usable up, even if it wasn't "cutsey"
[2015/10/23 11:54:42] <Tobbi> I see...

[2015/10/23 11:57:28] <tuxdev_> nah, giby's comment on that issue is pretty much a dig at my lack of.. doing things
[2015/10/23 11:59:46] <tuxdev_> which is totally fair, since I *did* drop the ball in a very big way
[2015/10/23 12:05:51] <brmbrmcar> The forest trees could be decorated a bit, but not too much.

[2015/10/23 12:37:37] <Tobbi> That is when the server steps in and continues the work.

[2015/10/24 09:40:54] <datahead8888> head8debian, I would think people should post user support questions in the forum unless they have reason to believe it's a bug in Super Tux itself, in which case it could go in the tracker.  Then the developers would evaluate it.
[2015/10/24 09:41:16] <datahead8888> Though it really depends on what procedures you guys want to follow
[2015/10/24 09:41:30] <mt> support questions -> irc
[2015/10/24 09:41:33] <datahead8888> I usually view a tracker as something to monitor feature or bug requests
[2015/10/24 09:41:49] <datahead8888> Yeah, IRC, too, but some people don't use IRC.  A general forum can work for them then.
[2015/10/24 09:41:53] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/24 09:41:54] <datahead8888> The tracker, though, is not a general forum
[2015/10/24 09:42:28] <datahead8888> I'm saying I think they should use this forum or a related one for user questions: http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewforum.php?f=66
[2015/10/24 09:42:41] <mt> I agree, some people seem to think otherwise (but we can't stop them from opening an issue)
[2015/10/24 09:42:44] <datahead8888> Of course, some people are going to post in the tracker anyways, in which case you'd just tell them they need to put it in the forum
[2015/10/24 09:43:06] <datahead8888> No, you can't stop them, but you can close it and tell them to reopen it (or at least suggest it, even if you don't close it)
[2015/10/24 09:43:18] <datahead8888> ***reopen it in the forum I mean
[2015/10/24 09:44:01] <mt> What issue are you referring to anyway?
[2015/10/24 09:44:56] <datahead8888> I was referring to putting bugs and features in the tracker and user questions (when they probably did something wrong) in the Super Tux user forum
[2015/10/24 09:45:18] <datahead8888> Again, if they really think it's an issue in Super Tux that needs to be fixed, the tracker does make sense
[2015/10/24 09:45:35] <datahead8888> Otherwise those issues tend to get buried, which is bad
[2015/10/24 09:47:37] <mt> I currently don't see any support questions in the issue tracker
[2015/10/24 09:48:10] <mt> If you're referring to #199 and #200, it looks like the reporter actually thought those are bugs
[2015/10/24 09:49:35] <datahead8888> I was referring to https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/200.  Yes, he may have thought it was a bug, sorry.  I may have misread that.

[2015/10/24 19:27:51] <head8debian> Right now we need to go into a feature-freeze to make this release more stable.
[2015/10/24 19:27:58] <head8debian> And need bug testers...

[2015/10/24 21:24:30] <datahead8888> You could just have a group of people co-lead, you konw
[2015/10/24 21:24:40] <datahead8888> Sort of a council of elders :)
[2015/10/24 21:24:55] <datahead8888> "The Sacred Council of the Penguin"
[2015/10/24 21:28:59] <datahead8888> My suggestion for the feature freeze would be to decide what features are almost done that you really want in the release.  Then create a new "development" branch so that people who want to continue developing other features can continue doing so.  Likewise create a "release" branch, in which you only put the features you decided go into the release and bug fixes.  Every now and then merge the release branch into the devel
[2015/10/24 21:29:01] <datahead8888> opment branch so that it picks up the release changes.  After any last features for the release are done, you then go through a time period of beta testing and bug fixes.  You then move on to release candidates, and when one passes without having any big stability issues, you release the game.  All work for milestone 3 is done then from what was your "development" branch.
[2015/10/24 21:30:49] <datahead8888> This ensures that you define your scope for the release and that new, low priority features that might make the game unstable and force you to delay the release are not introduced
[2015/10/24 21:31:01] <datahead8888> Without such a plan, milestone 2 will probably be delayed indefinitely
[2015/10/24 21:35:23] <head8debian> datahead8888: We will release M2 as is, even if it is buggy, but there are no plans to incorperate anything much atm...

[2015/10/24 21:43:56] <datahead8888> You'd at least want to make sure it's stable, but going through a little beta testing would result in a good impression
[2015/10/24 21:44:37] <datahead8888> If you wanted to release in December, though, you'd have to start beta testing soon, if you wanted to go that route.  Otherwise you'd have to choose between not beta testing or delaying the release.
[2015/10/24 21:45:22] <datahead8888> I would generally view a dev snapshot as something that can be buggy and a milestone release as something that has been beta tested and finished some goals
[2015/10/24 21:47:49] <datahead8888> It is your decision, however.  This is just a suggestion.  The Super Tux team must decide this.
[2015/10/24 22:19:22] <head8debian> datahead8888: Yes... technically our last release was a beta.
[2015/10/24 22:19:44] <head8debian> But we have to step our testing up.
[2015/10/24 22:21:20] <head8debian> datahead8888: Currently we have quite a few people who have been reporting bugs tk us, but nothing very major has been found so far...
[2015/10/24 22:35:19] <Mathnerd314> head8debian: well, I am omniscient as far the code is concerned. github isn't too hard, I don't really pay attention to the forums though
[2015/10/24 22:36:18] <datahead8888> Yes, but you have introduced more features since your last dev snapshot.  In order to have a stable release, you have to freeze features on the current code and give a copy to people to test for at least a month.  Whether you call that copy a beta or a testable executable doesn't matter, but this is how you can be sure the release will be stable.
[2015/10/24 22:37:20] <datahead8888> Otherewise there is a good chance that a feature introduced very recently into master could cause an unstable release.  Think back to the issues we had on the Secret Chronicles release - that wasn't a code issue (it was a corrupt executable), but it shows just how serious stability issues can be.
[2015/10/24 22:37:27] <head8debian> http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=6608
[2015/10/24 22:37:43] <datahead8888> People said, "It [Secret Chronicles] seems buggy"
[2015/10/24 22:37:56] <datahead8888> It was crashing all the time on Windows
[2015/10/24 22:38:13] <datahead8888> It's up to you guys, though.  I just wanted to make sure I explained it well.
[2015/10/24 22:38:54] <head8debian> datahead8888: Yes, you have a good point...
[2015/10/24 22:39:43] <datahead8888> I would say that if no feature freeze is instituted, there's no point in finishing milestone 2.  Only dev snapshots are approriate (which means milestone 2 doesn't end).
[2015/10/24 22:39:52] <datahead8888> That's just my opinion, though
[2015/10/24 22:40:18] <datahead8888> Dev snapshots are for unstable releases
[2015/10/24 22:40:31] <datahead8888> (or this is how you've used them in the past)
[2015/10/24 22:40:59] <datahead8888> Dev snapshots, though, are not the same thing as the beta releases that I described - those require a feature freeze

[2015/10/25 16:53:05] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar, Did you actively choose to be annoying or is it some kind of disorder you have?
[2015/10/25 16:53:19] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar, You remind me of satdav...
[2015/10/25 16:53:33] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/10/25 16:53:57] <brmbrmcar> I figured it out...
[2015/10/25 16:54:11] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar, You cannot kick yourself. But you can quit...
[2015/10/25 16:54:20] <Tobbi> And believe me, I'd be more than grateful if you did.
[2015/10/25 16:55:11] <brmbrmcar> TRue enough.
[2015/10/25 16:55:48] * jesusalva sits.
[2015/10/25 16:56:06] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Hello.
[2015/10/25 16:58:39] <jesusalva> Hi Tobbi, how are youw
[2015/10/25 16:58:42] <jesusalva> ?
[2015/10/25 16:59:10] <Tobbi> jesusalva, I am "okay"...I think I decided to give up the supertux development lead role.
[2015/10/25 16:59:28] <jesusalva> why?
[2015/10/25 17:00:05] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Too much stress...
[2015/10/25 17:00:16] * jesusalva asks although he was Student Council president long enough to know exactly the reasons.
[2015/10/25 17:00:37] <jesusalva> You need a vacations, not to give up. Belive me. I was in your situation more than once.
[2015/10/25 17:01:10] <Tobbi> jesusalva, How old are you?
[2015/10/25 17:01:21] <jesusalva> And unless you are me who cannot take a vacation without worrying or overseeing the project anyway, which a vacation simply haves no effect on me...
[2015/10/25 17:01:37] <jesusalva> I am different in every aspect.
[2015/10/25 17:01:37] <Tobbi> jesusalva, I know *exactly* what you mean.
[2015/10/25 17:04:34] <jesusalva> Tobbi: I always have a Plan C. Mostly. When I have nothing to do I create lots of backup plans, or new features.
[2015/10/25 17:04:49] <Tobbi> jesusalva, I am in my masters course...
[2015/10/25 17:04:51] <jesusalva> Which reminds me of my own game which I powered on the computer to develop. :)
[2015/10/25 17:04:59] <Tobbi> But I need to think about a way out.
[2015/10/25 17:05:06] <Tobbi> My masters course wears me out.
[2015/10/25 17:05:29] * jesusalva opens google
[2015/10/25 17:06:44] <Tobbi> jesusalva, for what?
[2015/10/25 17:07:06] <jesusalva> I didn't remembered how it was in my home language. Wikipedia remembered me.
[2015/10/25 17:07:28] <jesusalva> Master course in what?

[2015/10/25 17:10:11] <jesusalva> Lemme see... I don't quite see the problem, usually I simply go to the secreatary and give up (and never appear again) or exit with someone.
[2015/10/25 17:10:28] <jesusalva> Or just wrap around my schedule so I can complete it. It depends.
[2015/10/25 17:32:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: You can give me ops. :) or rbot.
[2015/10/25 17:32:41] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Applied Computer Science Master.

[2015/10/25 17:32:48] <head8debian> leave*
[2015/10/25 17:32:51] <Tobbi> head8debian, Good.
[2015/10/25 17:33:02] <Tobbi> I assumed you left because of that.

[2015/10/25 18:15:53] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar, Can you please stop the childish behaviour?
[2015/10/25 18:16:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: He could if you gave him something serious to talk about. :)
[2015/10/25 18:16:45] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar, Okay, serious thing to talk about: "Animals that are capable of transforming into a mini-fridge".
[2015/10/25 18:18:11] <brmbrmcar> Really?
[2015/10/25 18:18:34] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar, yes.
[2015/10/25 18:19:26] <brmbrmcar> Which ones?
[2015/10/25 18:19:29] <brmbrmcar> Humans?
[2015/10/25 18:19:46] <leper`> Are humans animals?
[2015/10/25 18:20:30] <leper`> (Answers employing set theory give extra points)
[2015/10/25 18:20:49] <brmbrmcar> Yes.

[2015/10/25 18:21:06] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/10/25 18:21:39] <Tobbi> head8debian, Have you ever encountered an animal that can transform into a mini-fridge?
[2015/10/25 18:21:40] <Tobbi> Or seen proof thereof?
[2015/10/25 18:22:02] <leper`> I'm more interested in how you can achieve that and what the contents of that mini-fridge are
[2015/10/25 18:22:20] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/25 18:22:24] <leper`> (and what happens if you remove something from it, and then the animal transforms back)
[2015/10/25 18:22:37] <Tobbi> leper`, Interesting!
[2015/10/25 18:22:55] <brmbrmcar> Some animals are very cold...
[2015/10/25 18:23:07] <leper`> also worth using scientifc methods (aka empty all the fridges (ok nearly all)) to repeat those tests
[2015/10/25 18:23:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: no i havent...
[2015/10/25 18:23:20] <Tobbi> leper`, We should probably do that.
[2015/10/25 18:23:29] <leper`> or we could just go to the supermarket and buy food and something to drink
[2015/10/25 18:24:05] <leyyin> Tobbi, hmm, you are here
[2015/10/25 18:24:15] <leyyin> didn't you, like quit?

[2015/10/25 18:24:50] <Tobbi> leyyin, I have decided that at this point, I like to think about animals who are able to transform into a mini-fridge and I had no one to talk to.
[2015/10/25 18:25:05] <leyyin> is this a new hippie shit world order type of thing?

[2015/10/25 18:25:09] <brmbrmcar> I like the cold.
[2015/10/25 18:25:19] <leper`> brmbrmcar: Do you also like trains?
[2015/10/25 18:25:24] <brmbrmcar> I could be a mini-fridge.
[2015/10/25 18:25:42] <leyyin> Tobbi, man, did you burn all your stash?
[2015/10/25 18:25:55] <brmbrmcar> I like trains,especially with rearward facing seats and seat belts.

[2015/10/25 18:28:49] <head8debian> Even if i ask politely...
[2015/10/25 18:28:49] <Tobbi> head8debian, Ergo, q.e.d.
[2015/10/25 18:28:55] <head8debian> ?
[2015/10/25 18:29:07] <Tobbi> head8debian, Quod erat demonstrandum.
[2015/10/25 18:29:10] <Tobbi> It's latin.
[2015/10/25 18:29:21] <Tobbi> You should know that...
[2015/10/25 18:29:22] <leper`> I think he understood that part
[2015/10/25 18:29:22] <head8debian> ...
[2015/10/25 18:29:31] <head8debian> I still don't.
[2015/10/25 18:29:48] <Tobbi> The little wascal has spiwit.

[2015/10/25 18:30:46] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/25 18:31:32] <jesusalva> leper`: You will end up with molecular dispersion, and well, if you remove something, it dies. You may have taken his heart by accident. It will also be gross if you want to keep it alive. And we don't have molecular dispersion technology to rearrange the molecular arrangement.
[2015/10/25 18:31:48] <jesusalva> maybe dispersion is not the correct word, "rearrangement" is better.
[2015/10/25 18:32:35] <leper`> well it could turn into the mini-fridge again
[2015/10/25 18:32:48] <leper`> then we put the removed things back in place
[2015/10/25 18:33:10] <jesusalva> You could kill it in process. Life is too fragile, unfortunately. :(
[2015/10/25 18:33:53] <jesusalva> Although such animal would have dummy organs which you take away, but the taste... Well... It depends in what you rearranged. It may be toxic.
[2015/10/25 18:34:31] <Tobbi> head8debian, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krb2OdQksMc
[2015/10/25 18:34:53] <brmbrmcar> sudo xkill
[2015/10/25 18:34:57] <jesusalva> It could also rearrange the organs positions, use needless organs to fill it, and send chemical substances to recolor the skin.
[2015/10/25 18:35:34] <jesusalva> If you remove an organ, it couldn't be put back at place and I wonder the pain it would fell, think in someone ripping off your heart (and you still alive, ofc)
[2015/10/25 18:35:43] @ Quit: leyyin: Quit: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
[2015/10/25 18:35:56] <leper`> well but at that point it is a fridge
[2015/10/25 18:36:17] <leper`> so unless we conduct some experiments we do not know that, do we?
[2015/10/25 18:36:42] <leper`> (could just be someone switching out the animal for a mini-fridge while we aren't looking)
[2015/10/25 18:36:51] <jesusalva> So while it wouldn't have bones, and the movement would be terrible... You could do it on the moment you can create life. Which you cannot, Biogenesis theory.
[2015/10/25 18:37:15] <leper`> then what would happen if we just add something to the fridge and let it transform back (if that latter part is even possible)
[2015/10/25 18:37:20] <jesusalva> leper`: You can theorically test it. Pratice is not all that exists.
[2015/10/25 18:37:33] <leper`> yes, but theory doesn't have explosions
[2015/10/25 18:37:44] <leper`> and explosions are how you get funding
[2015/10/25 18:37:52] <jesusalva> leper`: It would be strange body on him. He probably would die.
[2015/10/25 18:37:55] <leper`> you need to think of your career
[2015/10/25 18:37:57] <brmbrmcar> Fridge.
[2015/10/25 18:38:23] <jesusalva> leper`: What do you want, that you start the game, it explodes and display: "You have been trolled"?
[2015/10/25 18:38:36] <jesusalva> Hey, nice idea. A April 1st release.
[2015/10/25 18:38:56] <leper`> buf if organs are changed into more common objects in a fridge, what can you get by adding some common objects to it
[2015/10/25 18:39:09] <leper`> do these actually change form if we reverse the transformation?
[2015/10/25 18:39:20] <leper`> jesusalva: sometimes yes, yes :D
[2015/10/25 18:39:58] <jesusalva> common objects aren't biologically registered as part of him. Unless he is emmiting some gamma waveform which corrups molecular information, the organ-common-objects will change and common objects won't.
[2015/10/25 18:40:29] <leper`> so what if we combine multiple of those? (since they can't die while transformed)
[2015/10/25 18:41:03] <leper`> eg starfish have multiple of some organs (or rather most)
[2015/10/25 18:41:13] <leper`> so adding removing some might not result in death
[2015/10/25 18:42:00] <jesusalva> leper`, it depends. On the molecular type, it may not die even if you break it, except you let a part away from other. On camouflage, it could bite you. It wouldn't be a real fridge.
[2015/10/25 18:42:03] @ Quit: brmbrmcar: Quit: brmbrmtrain supertux
[2015/10/25 18:42:34] <jesusalva> It would look like one, but it wouldn't be one. Which is more possible and reasonable than an annimal emmiting gamma rays or something even worse.
[2015/10/25 18:43:01] <jesusalva> I mean, if you get near during his transformation, you could die and have your organs integrated to it. :/
[2015/10/25 18:43:30] @ xet7 joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/25 18:43:50] <jesusalva> Such animal would be immortal as long he/she/it was a fridge. No need to eat, drink, nor anything.
[2015/10/25 18:43:54] <leper`> so we could have "some scientists were harmed during the making of this movie" in case we don't find anything and just make our video logs a horror flick
[2015/10/25 18:44:12] <jesusalva> If he stays alive is questionable. Seems more reasonable of a mechanic/eletronic nature.
[2015/10/25 18:44:25] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/25 18:44:36] <jesusalva> I mean, you could hack that animal. Possibly.

[2015/10/25 18:45:43] <leper`> that was actually the least cruel thing suggested in the last 20 minutes

[2015/10/25 18:59:24] <leper`> though that exploded
[2015/10/25 18:59:25] <leper`> thus funding
[2015/10/25 18:59:39] <Tobbi> leper`, I never played Warcraft...
[2015/10/25 18:59:58] <Tobbi> I never played a lot besides Stratego, Settlers and SuperTux(kart)?
[2015/10/25 19:00:04] <leper`> you could click sheep until they exploded (I think, has been ages)
[2015/10/25 19:00:06] <jesusalva> Now, about hacking it... It's "life" would be like the life of a computer: Non-biologic. Which means you can hack, if you find a way in.
[2015/10/25 19:01:11] <jesusalva> Also, if you create such thing in laboratory, you could change it's default behavior. It would be full of randoms, wait and move at a random direction, and turn in a minifridge if something is too near util elapsed time.
[2015/10/25 19:01:29] <Tobbi> Okay, stop it.
[2015/10/25 19:01:34] <Tobbi> Let's talk about something different...
[2015/10/25 19:01:40] <jesusalva> Ooh,
[2015/10/25 19:01:41] <Tobbi> Animals capable of transforming into a shoebox.
[2015/10/25 19:02:24] <jesusalva> Same thing. Just go on line 47 and change "mini_fridge()" to "shoebox()", and redeclare the function on shoebox.cdat. Wow! problem solved!
[2015/10/25 19:02:36] <jesusalva> And it can have shoes, much easier to do!
[2015/10/25 19:03:18] <Tobbi> help!
[2015/10/25 19:03:20] <jesusalva> After all, it's made of leather, which is skin. How nice! You simplified the process! It could be a ALIVE shoebox, which stops when something is too near.
[2015/10/25 19:03:21] <leper`> I'd like to refer to previous discussion about the contents of animals turning into mini-frigdes and generalize that[#supertux on 2015-10-25]
[2015/10/25 19:03:25] <Tobbi> No more programming! I know nothing about computers.
[2015/10/25 19:03:31] <jesusalva> It can even be biologic! ;)
[2015/10/25 19:04:33] <jesusalva> Tobbi: Just talk about music. Showing mathematics and how to make your computer create musics automatically seems a nicely annoying topic... ok ok, I stop. ;)
[2015/10/25 19:04:51] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Talk about something interesting...
[2015/10/25 19:05:07] <jesusalva> How life started to exist.
[2015/10/25 19:06:19] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Please, no. If head8debian reads that, ...
[2015/10/25 19:06:38] <jesusalva> ...Ok then...
[2015/10/25 19:06:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: I read what? :D
[2015/10/25 19:06:40] <Tobbi> jesusalva, According to your name, you're Christian or Catholic...Fine with me.
[2015/10/25 19:06:54] <Tobbi> But please, let's not discuss world creation.
[2015/10/25 19:06:58] <Tobbi> head8debian, Nothing, nothing.
[2015/10/25 19:07:16] <jesusalva> Christian. Studied a lot about a lot of things, giving me basic degree on a very wide range of things, which is necessary to my personality
[2015/10/25 19:07:33] <jesusalva> Now, we could talk about penguins.
[2015/10/25 19:07:42] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Fried ones? Good!
[2015/10/25 19:07:45] <head8debian> FreedroidRPG ftw. :D
[2015/10/25 19:08:01] <Tobbi> jesusalva, What do you say about the refugees in Germany?
[2015/10/25 19:09:33] <Tobbi> Or refugees in general, or stuff?
[2015/10/25 19:09:44] <Tobbi> or foreigners...?
[2015/10/25 19:10:19] <jesusalva> ...I have nothing to say. I study more about Israel than about other nations, including Brazil.
[2015/10/25 19:10:38] <Tobbi> I see...

[2015/10/25 19:42:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: What does his opinion matter to you? :)
[2015/10/25 19:43:06] <Tobbi> head8debian, I just want to talk about something that doesn't involve computers...
[2015/10/25 19:45:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: :)
[2015/10/25 19:45:55] <head8debian>  Tobbi Good, tell me how to sell my car. :D
[2015/10/25 19:46:28] <Tobbi> head8debian, Price tag with "$0.99" on it and it should sell quite good.
[2015/10/25 19:46:33] <Tobbi> *well
[2015/10/25 19:48:49] <head8debian> Tobbi: o_O
[2015/10/25 19:49:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: If you will cover the other $1,249 i will do it. :D
[2015/10/25 19:49:42] <Tobbi> head8debian, You want to sell it for $1,250? That's more than I earned at Mozilla in a week!
[2015/10/25 19:50:56] <jesusalva> See Tobbi? You just got back at computers.
[2015/10/25 19:51:03] <Tobbi> jesusalva, I am sorry.
[2015/10/25 19:51:17] <jesusalva> Besides, if you sell it at "$0.99", Police officers will think it stolen.
[2015/10/25 19:51:43] <jesusalva> After all, why someone on earth would sell a CAR for 99 cents?
[2015/10/25 19:51:51] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Because it's broken?
[2015/10/25 19:51:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its decentprice for the car...
[2015/10/25 19:52:01] <Tobbi> head8debian, Not for mine, anyway...
[2015/10/25 19:52:06] <head8debian> And its not broken. :D
[2015/10/25 19:52:08] <head8debian> Hehe.
[2015/10/25 19:52:19] <Tobbi> head8debian, Matter of definition, right?
[2015/10/25 19:52:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: I will buy your car for $200. :D
[2015/10/25 19:52:49] <head8debian> Tobbi: No, thats honestly what my car is worth and what im selling it as.
[2015/10/25 19:53:30] <Tobbi> head8debian, I already told you, it's this one:http://db.carbuzz.com/images2/390000/9000/200/399230.jpg And there's no way on earth you will get that for $200 :D
[2015/10/25 19:53:32] <jesusalva> head8debian, it depends on where you live. And don't you need to be 18 to drive a car? o_o
[2015/10/25 19:53:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: Go buy a $60,000 truck if you think my car is so expensive...
[2015/10/25 19:53:44] <head8debian> jesusalva: No, 16 here.
[2015/10/25 19:53:53] <jesusalva> o_o
[2015/10/25 19:54:02] <head8debian> O_o
[2015/10/25 19:54:03] <head8debian> :D
[2015/10/25 19:54:19] <head8debian> {D
[2015/10/25 19:54:27] * head8debian 's hat^^
[2015/10/25 19:54:28] <Tobbi> jesusalva, You know: Americans are all like "Opportunity". If you want the opportunity to wreck yourself, go right ahead. At 16 you can be assumed reasonable enough to know what wrecking means.
[2015/10/25 19:54:29] <head8debian> :p
[2015/10/25 19:54:49] <Tobbi> Whereas Germans are all for general safety...
[2015/10/25 19:54:57] <jesusalva> 21?
[2015/10/25 19:55:02] <Tobbi> Meaning: They won't let head8debian drive at all. Or only after extensive tests.
[2015/10/25 19:55:08] <Tobbi> psychological and everything.
[2015/10/25 19:55:24] <Tobbi> And after reading this channel for quite some time, I believe it's doubtful that head8debian will ever pass.
[2015/10/25 19:55:32] <Tobbi> jesusalva, No 18.
[2015/10/25 19:55:44] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Or, 17 with a guardian present.
[2015/10/25 19:56:07] <jesusalva> Brazil need 18, and a lot of tests and LOTS of burocratic papers to make life merrier. That's why you pay for someone do the paperwork in addition to the tests.
[2015/10/25 19:56:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: We can drive at 15 with guardian. actually 14 and 9months.
[2015/10/25 19:56:17] <Tobbi> wow.
[2015/10/25 19:56:27] <head8debian> Thats not a full licence...
[2015/10/25 19:56:29] <jesusalva> Not that lot, but you must test-drive.
[2015/10/25 19:56:31] <Tobbi> Still.
[2015/10/25 19:56:39] <head8debian> I don't get a full licence till im at least 17.
[2015/10/25 19:57:02] <head8debian> But i can drive myself and my siblings for now. :)
[2015/10/25 19:57:17] <head8debian> And thats about it.
[2015/10/25 19:57:20] <jesusalva> Here there is no "guardian" idea... At least, I don't think so. Either you're 18 and have burocratic papers to drive, or you cannot drive.
[2015/10/25 19:57:45] <head8debian> Hehe.
[2015/10/25 19:57:58] <head8debian> We have lots of papers and lots of insurance and lots of taxes...
[2015/10/25 19:57:58] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Where are you from, again?
[2015/10/25 19:58:08] <jesusalva> I said above.
[2015/10/25 19:58:12] <Tobbi> head8debian, And lots of overweight people as well.
[2015/10/25 19:58:14] <jesusalva> Brazil need 18
[2015/10/25 19:58:19] <Tobbi> Oh, right.
[2015/10/25 19:58:26] <head8debian> Insurance is like $2000 a year for most under 25...
[2015/10/25 19:58:33] <head8debian> For 1 vehicle.
[2015/10/25 19:58:38] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Are there beautiful women in your country? IMO yes :-)
[2015/10/25 19:58:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot help people's weight... Its their own doing.
[2015/10/25 19:59:01] * head8debian rolls his eyes...
[2015/10/25 19:59:03] <jesusalva> head8debian: Taxes we have the most. Interested in buying a cellphone for R$600 where $270 are government taxes?
[2015/10/25 19:59:18] <Tobbi> head8debian, Well, you could...You know... motivate everyone to step on a treadmill...
[2015/10/25 19:59:19] <head8debian> jesusalva: Its almost jsut as bad here. :)
[2015/10/25 19:59:45] @ Quit: xet7: Quit: Leaving
[2015/10/25 19:59:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: How? Give me a cheap logical reason...
[2015/10/25 20:00:03] <jesusalva> I can't belive you pay almost 42% as taxes...
[2015/10/25 20:00:07] <head8debian> I don't want to step on the treadmill. :D
[2015/10/25 20:00:29] <head8debian> jesusalva: On average over 50% of our money goes back as taxes...
[2015/10/25 20:00:39] <head8debian> In one way or another.
[2015/10/25 20:01:22] <head8debian> Plus, by the time the products/food reaches the store you have 75% of its cost in taxes.
[2015/10/25 20:01:24] <jesusalva> You could try to sell the car which is $1250 for $1775 or just burn it in protest for high taxes.
[2015/10/25 20:02:03] <jesusalva> And then sell ot to a scrapeyard for $20. Riches!
[2015/10/25 20:02:15] <Tobbi> I just noticed: Presidential elections will be soon, right?
[2015/10/25 20:02:18] <jesusalva> (Not sure if this is the correct price...)
[2015/10/25 20:02:46] <jesusalva> Tobbi: Here it depends if they will be able to remove the president, vice and national congress president togheter.
[2015/10/25 20:03:01] <Tobbi> Hmm, no idea.
[2015/10/25 20:03:12] <head8debian> Oh, and we have sales tax on *everything* except food. Buy a $30,000 vehicle and you have $5,000 in taxes plus title, insurance and all the other crud.
[2015/10/25 20:03:22] <head8debian> On top of the 30,000.
[2015/10/25 20:03:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: For us presedential elections are next year... wish it would get here sooner. :D
[2015/10/25 20:04:04] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2015/10/25 20:04:05] <Tobbi> 2016.
[2015/10/25 20:04:07] <Tobbi> We're in 2015.
[2015/10/25 20:04:33] <Tobbi> For us, it's in 2 years.
[2015/10/25 20:04:55] <jesusalva> Here the taxes include food. Buy a car for $30,000 knowing that $12,600 are taxes, and then pay insurance, driver license, Annual Impost Over Vehicles (IPVA), not to say that if it's a truck or a motorcycle you must pay an extra license.
[2015/10/25 20:04:57] <head8debian> Our president needs to give golf a break and pay attention to whats actually going on...
[2015/10/25 20:05:10] <head8debian> jesusalva: Ok, ouch.
[2015/10/25 20:05:32] <head8debian> jesusalva: Is your 'nation' 18 trillion in debt also? :D
[2015/10/25 20:05:41] <head8debian> Not sure what you call Brazil...
[2015/10/25 20:06:20] <jesusalva> For us it's in... 3 years? Yes, 3 years. The president was reelected last year and every 3 days there is an "impeachment" movement somewhere on Brazil.
[2015/10/25 20:06:38] * head8debian feels like we are being strangled... slowly...
[2015/10/25 20:07:24] <Tobbi> 78% of the BIP are depts in Germany.
[2015/10/25 20:07:38] <Tobbi> But that's lower than france, greece (:P) or spain.
[2015/10/25 20:08:24] <jesusalva> Here they are reducing the reserves to pay the WorldWide Monetary Funds because more money is necessary to do the very basic.
[2015/10/25 20:09:09] <head8debian> Wow, we have bought alot off of ebay this year. o_O
[2015/10/25 20:09:20] <head8debian> Over 70 orders...
[2015/10/25 20:09:34] <Tobbi> I think Germany's economy is quite well...
[2015/10/25 20:09:37] * head8debian the joys of maintaining a farm...
[2015/10/25 20:11:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: Feel free to say something. http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=6608&sid=4fd9456197538bced9d4ad67604aa942
[2015/10/25 20:11:55] <jesusalva> head8debian: Here we aren't buying too much, after the dollar reaching it's peak of R$4.15, people are afraid to buy outside... Altough some still do...
[2015/10/25 20:12:00] <head8debian> jesusalva: freedroidrpg's bugtracker doesn't get much activity. :)
[2015/10/25 20:12:17] <Tobbi> head8debian, ACK
[2015/10/25 20:12:31] <Tobbi> jesusalva, I should've done my internship during this time...
[2015/10/25 20:12:33] <head8debian> Tobbi: ACK? HACK?MACK?BACK?TRACK?
[2015/10/25 20:12:37] <Tobbi> Way more money.
[2015/10/25 20:12:42] <Tobbi> head8debian, ACK = acknowledged.
[2015/10/25 20:12:45] <head8debian> Huh, whats that mean?
[2015/10/25 20:12:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: Oh.
[2015/10/25 20:12:57] <jesusalva> It had some more when I was on their DEV team. But my Unfriendly list is too long with just 2 names, so I retired util 2017... Or util I find a way to shorten that list.
[2015/10/25 20:13:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Don't make up synonomonomonooms. :p
[2015/10/25 20:13:06] <Tobbi> head8debian, I didn't.
[2015/10/25 20:13:20] <Tobbi> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACK
[2015/10/25 20:13:36] * head8debian wants Tobbi to stop giving me links...
[2015/10/25 20:13:36] <jesusalva> It's kinda known on projects like freedroidRPG.
[2015/10/25 20:13:36] <Tobbi> Ack or ACK may refer to: Acknowledgement (data networks), a signal to acknowledge the receipt of data
[2015/10/25 20:13:57] * Tobbi wants head8debian to finally learn how to build proper sentences with himself as the first person.
[2015/10/25 20:14:21] * head8debian thinks Tobbi has a good point...
[2015/10/25 20:14:28] * head8debian will try to better.
[2015/10/25 20:14:37] * head8debian will try to do better.*
[2015/10/25 20:14:50] * Tobbi thinks that thinking is a tedious process and will thus stop thinking.
[2015/10/25 20:16:09] * jesusalva loves thinking and when he have nothing to do he thinks and thinks and create new features and ideas and things which thinks which make the think more and more, over and over the same thing which think again... Util he stops thinking to think again about a thing which doesn't think so he may think on something else.
[2015/10/25 20:16:12] <jesusalva> Duh.
[2015/10/25 20:16:15] * head8debian thinks Tobbi needs to stop saying random things that are impossible... such as a human fridge that isn't a fridge.
[2015/10/25 20:17:07] * Tobbi thinks that if everyone who ever used //me in messages would pay him 1 USD, he'd be rich by now.
[2015/10/25 20:17:11] * head8debian thinks he should go to bed...
[2015/10/25 20:17:19] <Tobbi> head8debian, What time is it?
[2015/10/25 20:17:28] <jesusalva> head8debian: It's possible to a fridge don't be a fridge if you are using "fridge" as a symbol or a reference to something else... Or if you are in brazil where every word have up to 20 different meanings.
[2015/10/25 20:17:35] <head8debian> Actually, no you wouldn't. Ive never done //me. :D
[2015/10/25 20:17:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: 8:15PM. :D
[2015/10/25 20:17:50] <Tobbi> Tobbi thinks that if everyone who ever used /me in messages would pay him 1 USD, he'd be rich by now.
[2015/10/25 20:17:52] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2015/10/25 20:17:54] <Tobbi> wait.
[2015/10/25 20:18:00] * Tobbi thinks that if everyone who ever used //me in messages would pay him 1 USD, he'd be rich by now.
[2015/10/25 20:18:01] <jesusalva> I did it twice I think... When I was showing someone the me command.
[2015/10/25 20:18:07] * Tobbi thinks that if everyone who ever used /me in messages would pay him 1 USD, he'd be rich by now.
[2015/10/25 20:18:12] <Tobbi> Okay, it still works.
[2015/10/25 20:18:13] <Tobbi> I'm fine.
[2015/10/25 20:18:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: :p
[2015/10/25 20:18:17] <jesusalva> Here it's 22:16.
[2015/10/25 20:18:22] <Tobbi> 01:16
[2015/10/25 20:18:28] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/10/25 20:18:36] <jesusalva> Yes, I would calc now that we are on summertime but ok...
[2015/10/25 20:18:38] <Tobbi> not *that* late by my standards.
[2015/10/25 20:18:50] <red_bot> /meZZZzzz
[2015/10/25 20:18:55] <jesusalva> head8debian, almost everyone here is 5 hours ahead you.

[2015/10/25 20:19:05] <Tobbi> stop it...
[2015/10/25 20:19:17] <Tobbi> You're becoming more brmbrmcar-y every day.
[2015/10/25 20:19:30] <jesusalva> What happened with "sydney_bot"?
[2015/10/25 20:19:36] <head8debian> Well good. I like to go to bed around 22:00 and get up around 8:00AM.
[2015/10/25 20:19:43] <Tobbi> such early.
[2015/10/25 20:19:48] <head8debian> jesusalva: He got reset and turned into red_bot.
[2015/10/25 20:20:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: I know you like brmbrmcar. :D
[2015/10/25 20:20:29] <Tobbi> head8debian, I think he's annoying.
[2015/10/25 20:20:38] <jesusalva> Reminding me... I should be going to sleep. GN folks...
[2015/10/25 20:20:51] <Tobbi> night
[2015/10/25 20:20:51] * head8debian hopes Tobbi doesn't think i said 'like' in a certial way...
[2015/10/25 20:21:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: Goodnight. :-)
[2015/10/25 20:21:06] <Tobbi> not to me.
[2015/10/25 20:21:09] <Tobbi> I said night to him.
[2015/10/25 20:21:23] <Tobbi> head8debian, certial?
[2015/10/25 20:21:33] <head8debian> Tobbi: Certian***
[2015/10/25 20:21:35] <Tobbi> You mean cereal?
[2015/10/25 20:21:47] <Tobbi> head8debian, http://www.dict.cc/?s=certian
[2015/10/25 20:21:47] <head8debian> jesusalva: So, how have you been, and what have you been up to? :)
[2015/10/25 20:22:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: GoOdNiGhT!1!
[2015/10/25 20:22:08] <Tobbi> head8debian,  http://www.dict.cc/?s=curtain ?
[2015/10/25 20:22:22] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/25 20:22:27] <Tobbi> head8debian, I don't intend to go to bed this early.
[2015/10/25 20:25:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Early?
[2015/10/25 20:25:11] * head8debian feels like ...
[2015/10/25 20:25:22] <Tobbi> head8debian, I get up at 11am every day...
[2015/10/25 20:27:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yikes...
[2015/10/25 20:27:35] @ datahead8888 joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/25 20:27:49] <Tobbi> head8debian, Okay, on tuesday I get up at 9...something AM
[2015/10/25 20:27:57] <Tobbi> Because: Lecture at 10.
[2015/10/25 20:28:09] <head8debian> :D
[2015/10/25 20:28:49] <jesusalva> Go sleep early and you will be 10% less stressed.
[2015/10/25 20:29:17] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Which is not a lot.
[2015/10/25 20:29:28] <jesusalva> Consider adding "Leave" as a standard procedure for unecessary stressing situations.
[2015/10/25 20:29:33] <Tobbi> Considering my general stress level is higher than tolerable.
[2015/10/25 20:29:38] <jesusalva> Like a annoying certain brm...
[2015/10/25 20:29:45] <Tobbi> jesusalva, I considered it once. It's called suicide.
[2015/10/25 20:29:50] <Tobbi> And generally not very helpful...
[2015/10/25 20:30:04] <jesusalva> Tobbi: "Leave" is different from "Abandon"
[2015/10/25 20:30:17] <Tobbi> jesusalva, True.
[2015/10/25 20:30:20] <jesusalva> "Leave" is exiting the room whenever this is an option.
[2015/10/25 20:30:31] <Tobbi> jesusalva, ...or the window from the 10th floor.
[2015/10/25 20:30:39] <Tobbi> *on
[2015/10/25 20:31:07] <jesusalva> Death is not an option. Never.
[2015/10/25 20:31:25] <Tobbi> jesusalva, I know...
[2015/10/25 20:31:39] <Tobbi> jesusalva, What about self-harm? :P
[2015/10/25 20:32:12] <Tobbi> Okay, let's stop this.
[2015/10/25 20:32:15] <Tobbi> I didn't mean it.
[2015/10/25 20:33:44] <Tobbi> head8debian, What's the capital of Iowa?
[2015/10/25 20:33:49] <Tobbi> eeh *Idaho
[2015/10/25 20:34:12] <jesusalva> Try eating better food (tomato and such), sleeping at least 9 hours per day, remember to strech yourself every morning after waking up and every 2 hours, eat a apple or a banana if you didn't eat anything past 2 hours and won't on next two...
[2015/10/25 20:34:35] <jesusalva> Drink water, and going to church can be helpful.
[2015/10/25 20:35:10] <jesusalva> If you stay sitted on lectures, get up between one and another even if you will sit 10 seconds later.
[2015/10/25 20:35:50] <Tobbi> jesusalva, I don't go to church.
[2015/10/25 20:35:58] <Tobbi> I don't intend to go to church either.
[2015/10/25 20:36:19] <jesusalva> You should consider doing it. It can be unnerving. You can also try crochet or something similar.
[2015/10/25 20:36:58] <Tobbi> jesusalva, I do sports twice a week...
[2015/10/25 20:36:59] <Tobbi> that's okay.
[2015/10/25 20:37:24] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Basically, I intend to keep away from churches entirely...I even gave up gospel choir singing...
[2015/10/25 20:37:37] <jesusalva> Can't understand why.
[2015/10/25 20:39:14] <Tobbi> jesusalva, *sigh* Because I want to? Because I feel that religion just prevents me from living a good life?
[2015/10/25 20:40:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: Good question.
[2015/10/25 20:40:36] <jesusalva> I disagree but ok, see, that's why I said about stressing situations. Even if I have good arguments and reasons to you change your viewpoint, if rethinking about it cannot help you (and you're final on your decision) avoid such conversations, be dismissive.
[2015/10/25 20:40:58] <Tobbi> head8debian, Okay, I'm relieved that I'm not the only one who doesn't know.
[2015/10/25 20:41:12] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Maybe church is different in your country than in mine?
[2015/10/25 20:42:32] <jesusalva> Hm. Maybe. The only thing which must be equal is the bible and unhapply it isn't.
[2015/10/25 20:42:52] <jesusalva> Some churches changes the bible to met their viewpoint.
[2015/10/25 20:43:20] <jesusalva> Tobbi: It's Boise?
[2015/10/25 20:43:26] <jesusalva> Idaho capital.
[2015/10/25 20:43:31] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Yes, according to what I read.
[2015/10/25 20:44:26] <jesusalva> Must sleep. see you. bye. :)
[2015/10/25 20:44:34] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Regarding religion: Religion always reminds me of strict rules. And I don't want to be reminded of that.
[2015/10/25 20:45:27] <jesusalva> Hm... That's not quite Christianism.... Altough when you truly met Jesus your will changes and stop wanting doing something... But then, you stop by free will.
[2015/10/25 20:46:16] <Tobbi> jesusalva, My parents kind of expected me to live up to religious standards. And I realized, I can do that without the religious part as well.
[2015/10/25 20:46:28] <Tobbi> I mean: My moral doesn't get bad only because it's not bound to religion any longer.
[2015/10/25 20:46:36] <Tobbi> Besides, maybe there's no wrong or right at all.
[2015/10/25 20:46:41] <Tobbi> Maybe it all depends on the situation.
[2015/10/25 20:47:33] <Tobbi> jesusalva, It says in the 10 commandments that killing someone is bad, but what about assisted suicide for people who are facing a horrible death?
[2015/10/25 20:48:46] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Also, if all people who don't belong to a religion had moral deficits, the world would be a gruesome place.
[2015/10/25 20:48:59] @ Quit: tuxdev_: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2015/10/25 20:49:03] <jesusalva> About wrong/right, well, I disagree. Even if no one teaches you, assassinating a human will make your conscience pond. "It's wrong", you'll feel.
[2015/10/25 20:49:30] <jesusalva> Although some ways of brainwashing can remove this felling.
[2015/10/25 20:49:34] <jesusalva> *kinds
[2015/10/25 20:49:59] <jesusalva> 10 commandments? I know only 2: Love God above all, and love the one next to you.
[2015/10/25 20:50:09] <jesusalva> These two simplifies the 10 commandments.
[2015/10/25 20:50:41] <jesusalva> Does this answer your question?
[2015/10/25 20:50:47] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/10/25 20:52:06] <Tobbi> jesusalva, I try to believe in myself...and in my capabilities.
[2015/10/25 20:52:09] <Tobbi> It has helped me before.
[2015/10/25 20:52:26] <jesusalva> It never helped me.
[2015/10/25 20:52:27] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Maybe God is not so different from you? maybe god is you?
[2015/10/25 20:52:35] <jesusalva> Totally not!
[2015/10/25 20:52:37] <Tobbi> Maybe everyone is god?
[2015/10/25 20:52:40] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Why not?
[2015/10/25 20:52:47] <jesusalva> What is God?
[2015/10/25 20:53:00] <Tobbi> jesusalva, If you don't know what God is, how can you say that it's not you?
[2015/10/25 20:53:04] <Tobbi> Or everyone, for that matter?
[2015/10/25 20:53:19] <jesusalva> I know who and what he is. I want to know your answer.
[2015/10/25 20:53:47] <Tobbi> I'd say "God" has many different aspects to it.
[2015/10/25 20:54:05] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Is god a "he"?
[2015/10/25 20:54:21] <Tobbi> Didn't you make it more human by applying gender to it?
[2015/10/25 20:54:50] <jesusalva> Depends. It's used as "He" but God doesn't have gender. But he is pessoal, so you cannot use "it" to define God.
[2015/10/25 20:55:02] <jesusalva> Like you use "she" for some ships, instead of "it".
[2015/10/25 20:55:10] <head8debian> The Bible has always refered to God as "He".
[2015/10/25 20:55:22] <head8debian> Precisely.
[2015/10/25 20:55:25] <Tobbi> head8debian, but why?
[2015/10/25 20:55:31] <jesusalva> Tobbi: God isn't similar to humans, humans are similar to God.
[2015/10/25 20:55:44] <jesusalva> Because God created us at his similarness.
[2015/10/25 20:56:01] <Tobbi> jesusalva, if god loves everyone in an equal fashion why did he choose the male form?
[2015/10/25 20:56:10] <Tobbi> ...which he apparently preferred?
[2015/10/25 20:56:21] <jesusalva> Wait, hebraic question now.
[2015/10/25 20:56:45] <Tobbi> head8debian, Any idea as to why god is a "he"?
[2015/10/25 20:57:34] <jesusalva> God said: "I am who I am."
[2015/10/25 20:58:02] <jesusalva> And as I said, God is personal. If he wants to use the male form, it's his will. He haves a will, you know.
[2015/10/25 20:58:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Because thats what he refers himself as.
[2015/10/25 20:58:11] <Tobbi> jesusalva, A poor choice of words. He should've said "I am whichever form I am"
[2015/10/25 20:58:13] <jesusalva> I'm not sure if there is such differenciation on Hebrew though.
[2015/10/25 20:58:20] <Tobbi> Would be interesting to know.
[2015/10/25 20:58:41] <jesusalva> Tobbi: No, a perfect choice of words. He said "I am".
[2015/10/25 20:59:08] <jesusalva> If he said what you suggested, he would be agreeing with your viewpoint.
[2015/10/25 20:59:21] <jesusalva> That's why you must consider literalness on Bible sometimes.
[2015/10/25 20:59:33] <Tobbi> jesusalva, Doesn't "I" imply that he might be a person? After all, everything that implies someone is a person could also be implied by using the pronoun "I".
[2015/10/25 20:59:41] <jesusalva> Anyway, I must be going to sleep very soon.
[2015/10/25 20:59:59] <Tobbi> Would omiscient and omnipotent beings consider using the term "I" and thus make themselves more similar to us humans than they want?
[2015/10/25 21:00:05] <jesusalva> Yes, as I said, he is personal. The concept of person exists because Him.
[2015/10/25 21:00:19] <jesusalva> Tobbi,you  missed the point.
[2015/10/25 21:00:35] <Tobbi> maybe I did.
[2015/10/25 21:00:37] <jesusalva> He created the humans like him.
[2015/10/25 21:00:41] @ jesusalva_bot joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/25 21:00:44] <jesusalva> at his similarness.
[2015/10/25 21:01:00] <Tobbi> jesusalva, So, as a matter of speaking: Everyone is god.
[2015/10/25 21:01:01] <Tobbi> :-)
[2015/10/25 21:01:09] <Tobbi> (which I said earlier)
[2015/10/25 21:01:10] <jesusalva> So of course God/Human are similar. But not equal, because, God is onmipresent etc.
[2015/10/25 21:01:30] @ Quit: jesusalva: Quit: Good bye, God bless you.
[2015/10/25 21:01:37] <Tobbi> Why would omnipresence be a gift? I think it's a huge burden.
[2015/10/25 21:01:42] @ jesusalva_bot is now known as jesusalva
[2015/10/25 21:01:42] <Tobbi> Being everywhere at the same time...
[2015/10/25 21:01:48] <head8debian> He said that he made us in his image.
[2015/10/25 21:01:58] <jesusalva> Only he is. And do you know why?
[2015/10/25 21:02:05] <head8debian> And i have to run.
[2015/10/25 21:02:17] <Tobbi> Alright. I need to go to bed as well.
[2015/10/25 21:02:27] <jesusalva> Good night everyone.
[2015/10/25 21:02:43] <jesusalva> Tobbi, you pointed similarities.
[2015/10/25 21:02:58] <jesusalva> and forgot differences.
[2015/10/25 21:02:59] <Tobbi> jesusalva, We can continue tomorrow or any other day.
[2015/10/25 21:03:09] <Tobbi> Or *some other day.
[2015/10/25 21:03:14] <Tobbi> I don't know if I'll be around tomororw.
[2015/10/25 21:03:31] <jesusalva> God is above time and... oh ok. It's late anyway. Good night! :)
[2015/10/25 21:03:50] <jesusalva> Mum will

[2015/10/26 14:35:58] <Tobbi> Someone summoned me?
[2015/10/26 14:37:57] <Tobbi> Hume2, please keep "SuperTux team" as the author of the Bonus island levels.
[2015/10/26 14:38:33] <Tobbi> And for the license: I'd say these levels are under the same license the game is in.
[2015/10/26 14:42:23] <Hume2> Tobbi: The "author" field is still the same, but I don't know if I can do something with it, but the author is in fact me.
[2015/10/26 14:42:47] <Tobbi> Hume2, No, you're not the original author. You are the one who revamped the levels.
[2015/10/26 14:43:00] <Tobbi> That includes you, but that doesn't mean you're the sole author.
[2015/10/26 14:44:50] <Hume2> In fact it depends on me whether I want to be the author or not. I do this only when I have to do it.
[2015/10/26 14:45:26] <Tobbi> fine, whatever.
[2015/10/26 14:45:31] <Hume2> So when these levels are licensed automatically by the same license as whole supertux, then nothing changes.
[2015/10/26 14:47:29] <Karkus> Hume2: GPL 3?
[2015/10/26 14:47:52] <Hume2> Karkus: GPL 2+ / CC-by-sa 3.0
[2015/10/26 14:48:02] <Hume2> May I change it so something else?
[2015/10/26 14:48:13] <Karkus> not unless it's all your work
[2015/10/26 14:48:22] <Karkus> what would you change it to?
[2015/10/26 14:48:36] <Hume2> Don't you know what's the difference?
[2015/10/26 14:48:42] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/26 14:48:54] <Karkus> Hume2: Between GPL 2 and 3?
[2015/10/26 14:49:00] <Hume2> Yes.
[2015/10/26 14:49:42] <Karkus> Hume2: I do not know.
[2015/10/26 14:49:51] <Karkus> I know a little
[2015/10/26 14:50:47] <Karkus> Hume2: If you know, I would be interested.
[2015/10/26 14:51:59] <Hume2> Anyway, I don't know how it goes in other countries, but in Czech Republic is all of this licencing stuff useless, because the licence has to be in Czech. And the name of the license is not enough.
[2015/10/26 14:52:49] <Hume2> So basically, we have to add all used licences to SuperTux repository in all available languages.
[2015/10/26 14:53:21] <Tobbi> I doubt that's the case.
[2015/10/26 14:53:42] <Karkus> Hume2: Would a link to a website not be sufficient?
[2015/10/26 14:54:52] <Hume2> Karkus: I'm not sure. The users should receive the game together with the license.
[2015/10/26 14:56:07] <brmbrmcar> What's the point in the licenses anyway?
[2015/10/26 14:56:12] <Karkus> Hume2: But I mean, a link to the license in their language, should they need it
[2015/10/26 14:56:51] <Hume2> Karkus: What if someone without Internet receives SuperTux?
[2015/10/26 14:56:53] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: They are extremely important to protect people's work and stop others taking credit for it
[2015/10/26 14:57:38] <Karkus> Hume2: Fair point.
[2015/10/26 14:57:48] <brmbrmcar> Does it make a difference?
[2015/10/26 14:58:09] <Hume2> One other thing: The most of Czech people don't care about copyright anyway.
[2015/10/26 14:58:36] <Hume2> I must go, Bye!

[2015/10/26 14:59:24] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: I personally wouldn't be happy if people took my code and used it to make money after I gave it to an open source project (not that anyone would).
[2015/10/26 15:00:15] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: it seems wrong that an almost charitable project like this could have its assets used to make money without permission
[2015/10/26 15:00:25] <brmbrmcar> Yes, I see.
[2015/10/26 15:00:42] <Tobbi> Karkus, But it's allowed, isn't it?
[2015/10/26 15:00:45] <Tobbi> GPL?
[2015/10/26 15:00:52] <brmbrmcar> So they can be used for other open source stuff?
[2015/10/26 15:01:16] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: If under GPL 2+ also. Not any open source project though
[2015/10/26 15:01:36] <Tobbi> And I guess that was me, not brmbrmcar :P
[2015/10/26 15:01:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: If that's the Czech law
[2015/10/26 15:01:55] <Tobbi> Karkus, I have no idea about the Czech law.
[2015/10/26 15:01:57] <Tobbi> At all.
[2015/10/26 15:02:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: I personally haven't studied it closely. Or at all.
[2015/10/26 15:02:25] <Tobbi> Neither have I.
[2015/10/26 15:02:42] <Karkus> I am not a lawyer
[2015/10/26 15:03:17] <brmbrmcar> THE LAW!
[2015/10/26 15:03:23] <Tobbi> true.

[2015/10/26 15:03:57] <Karkus> hi
[2015/10/26 15:04:33] <Karkus> Hume2: Are you sure that it must be in Czech, because that seems a little off.
[2015/10/26 15:04:57] <Hume2> Karkus: Yes, I'm sure.
[2015/10/26 15:05:11] <Karkus> Hume2: Most likely foreign documents are valid though.
[2015/10/26 15:05:26] <leyyin> tell me one open source project that does that?
[2015/10/26 15:05:35] <leyyin> includes the license in czech?
[2015/10/26 15:05:51] <leyyin> in their source code
[2015/10/26 15:05:53] <Karkus> leyyin: A Czech one, maybe?

[2015/10/26 15:48:41] <Hume2> Thanks Tobbi.
[2015/10/26 15:48:57] <Tobbi> And please, guys, don't see me as a guiding person in terms of SuperTux.

[2015/10/26 15:49:41] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/10/26 15:49:49] <Tobbi> Hume2: Can you work on language add-ons? ;)
[2015/10/26 15:49:54] <brmbrmcar> I'm not verygood at levels.
[2015/10/26 15:49:55] <Tobbi> Would be a nice feature for 0.4.0

[2015/10/26 15:51:09] <brmbrmcar> I have made a few levels which are mainly scripts and doors.
[2015/10/26 15:51:23] <Hume2> Tobbi: Which branch do you mean? leveltweaks?

[2015/10/26 15:53:04] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It doesn't matter that you are not experienced. You'll get into it after several levels.
[2015/10/26 15:53:14] <head8debian> Should we make a #supertux-offtopic? :)
[2015/10/26 15:53:24] <Tobbi> head8debian: I'd say no.
[2015/10/26 15:53:34] <brmbrmcar> I say yes.

[2015/10/26 15:55:18] * jesusalva wakes up, checks #supertux, see nothing interesting beside addons talking happened, and goes back to sleep.

[2015/10/26 15:55:39] <Tobbi> So, no merging of the Mr Candle badguy?

[2015/10/26 15:58:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: I haven't changed much atm...
[2015/10/26 15:58:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: No problem.

[2015/10/26 16:01:07] <Tobbi> uhm, okay?
[2015/10/26 16:02:11] <Hume2> Tobbi: Would you like to test the mr. candle or I can rebase and merge it now? Head8debain has already tested it.
[2015/10/26 16:02:26] <Tobbi> Hume2: Alright, alright, I will test it real quick.
[2015/10/26 16:02:42] <Tobbi> I can't remember what it does.
[2015/10/26 16:03:21] <head8debian> I have not tested it.
[2015/10/26 16:03:45] <Hume2> I don't remember. Maybe it was Karkus who did.
[2015/10/26 16:04:30] <Hume2> Tobbi: It's a lighting badguy that can light lanterns when being squished by the lantern.
[2015/10/26 16:04:40] <Tobbi> Ah, yes.

[2015/10/26 16:06:09] <Tobbi> We can always improve it later ;)
[2015/10/26 16:06:18] <Tobbi> Although it's supposed to be stable, but, who cares.
[2015/10/26 16:07:41] <Hume2> I don't know why this should cause any unstability.
[2015/10/26 16:08:03] <Tobbi> Hume2: By stable I mean: People might assume badguys won't change later on...
[2015/10/26 16:08:16] <Tobbi> So, if we do substantial changes to mr candle later, it should be for MS 3.

[2015/10/26 16:36:54] <Hume2> Narre thought a good strategy for getting music: Steal the music from other games and apply some filters so noone will recognize it.
[2015/10/26 16:37:17] <Karkus> Hume2: I guess that's legal in the Czech Republic?
[2015/10/26 16:37:27] <Karkus> :P
[2015/10/26 16:37:37] <Tobbi> It certainly isn't legal here.

[2015/10/26 16:37:50] <Hume2> Karkus: It depends on the filters.

[2015/10/26 16:38:10] <Hume2> When it's the art of filters, it's allowed.

[2015/10/26 16:45:28] <Tobbi> I believe, regarding remixing a work, it needs to be under a certain CC license or under the PD
[2015/10/26 16:46:23] <Hume2> We had an extra lesson about copyright laws in Czech Republic, so I can say that I know it.
[2015/10/26 16:46:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Obviously, if it's PD then that's okay. Other than that, it must be either the same license in our case, or a license which is not strict enough to deny us it's use
[2015/10/26 16:46:46] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/10/26 16:46:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: Shrink the distances between the level points, please.
[2015/10/26 16:46:58] <Karkus> *its use
[2015/10/26 16:47:14] <Tobbi> Other than that, it looks good.
[2015/10/26 16:47:18] <Hume2> However, I don't know anything about how it works in other countries.
[2015/10/26 16:48:12] <Karkus> Hume2: I have a feeling that most countries will agree in some respects, as it's an international thing.
[2015/10/26 16:48:29] <Karkus> Where would we say Supertux is 'based'
[2015/10/26 16:48:39] <Karkus> Where is the supertux HQ?
[2015/10/26 16:48:42] <Karkus> :P
[2015/10/26 16:49:01] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/26 16:49:15] <Hume2> I think that it's in Germany.
[2015/10/26 16:49:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: SuperTux is based in... some small island country no one cares about.
[2015/10/26 16:49:37] <Tobbi> Because of no legislature...
[2015/10/26 16:49:39] <Tobbi> and that...
[2015/10/26 16:49:42] <Karkus> Falklands islands?
[2015/10/26 16:49:45] <Karkus> Oh wait.
[2015/10/26 16:50:08] <Karkus> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/72 what do you want to do Tobbi?
[2015/10/26 16:50:23] <Karkus> As it's 0.4.0
[2015/10/26 16:50:40] <Karkus> Also can we change it to be called 2.0.0?
[2015/10/26 16:51:08] <Hume2> I hate the versions rising exponencially.
[2015/10/26 16:51:16] <Tobbi> Karkus: I want to trace the paths to that particular point where tux is at and if nothing leads there (no unsolved levels tux could have gone from to that point), then disregard and set tux to the home position.
[2015/10/26 16:51:23] <Tobbi> That is my plan.
[2015/10/26 16:51:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: 2.0.0 is supposed to be super - duper stealthy stable.
[2015/10/26 16:51:43] <Tobbi> I don|t think it is that stable.
[2015/10/26 16:52:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: We haven't reached 1.0.0 in X billion years.
[2015/10/26 16:52:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: Hrm....
[2015/10/26 16:52:42] <Tobbi> I believe the plan was for it to be called 0.4.0 and to be stable.
[2015/10/26 16:52:51] <Tobbi> We can have a team meeting.
[2015/10/26 16:53:00] <Hume2> I saw somewhere that the milestone 3 is planned to be released in 2032.
[2015/10/26 16:53:03] <Karkus> I think - "milestone"."new feature releases"."bugfuxes"
[2015/10/26 16:53:17] @ tux|dude joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/26 16:53:20] <Karkus> Hume2: You are very optimistic, we need more people like you.
[2015/10/26 16:53:26] <Tobbi> Although http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Versioning_scheme mentions this.
[2015/10/26 16:53:32] <Tobbi> Mentions 0.4.0 I mean.
[2015/10/26 16:53:36] <Tobbi> And that was created before I joined.
[2015/10/26 16:53:53] <Tobbi> Hume2: 2032 was probably just a joke date set.
[2015/10/26 16:53:57] <Tobbi> By someone.
[2015/10/26 16:54:13] <Hume2> Tobbi: I think so.
[2015/10/26 16:54:39] <Hume2> OPr it could be for the people who want to know when it will be finally released.
[2015/10/26 16:54:49] <Hume2> s/OPr/Or/
[2015/10/26 16:54:49] <red_bot> Hume2 meant: "Or it could be for the people who want to know when it will be finally released."
[2015/10/26 16:55:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: I still think we should aim for that.
[2015/10/26 16:55:35] <Tobbi> hrm...
[2015/10/26 16:55:55] <Tobbi> Would be inconsistent with the previous versioning scheme.
[2015/10/26 16:56:45] <Karkus> Tobbi: We can discuss it in a meeting... which will be when?
[2015/10/26 16:57:00] <Tobbi> We can discuss it now.
[2015/10/26 16:57:09] <jesusalva> Funny. Tobbi simply cannot NOT be the leader. So much like me. ;)
[2015/10/26 16:57:18] <Tobbi> jesusalva: I don|t want to be the leader.
[2015/10/26 16:57:19] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/26 16:57:29] <Tobbi> I never agreed to be the leader, though I admit I acted like that
[2015/10/26 16:57:35] <jesusalva> He didn't even noticed he is STILL leading the project and no matter what he do he will always be doing that. :)
[2015/10/26 16:57:45] <Karkus> Tobbi is the dictator
[2015/10/26 16:57:53] <Tobbi> jesusalva: Not always. After MS 2 release, I will have to see.
[2015/10/26 16:58:07] <jesusalva> Tobbi: You cannot resign if you never acceoted to be the leader.
[2015/10/26 16:58:10] <Karkus> All hail Tobbi
[2015/10/26 16:58:16] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/26 16:58:18] <jesusalva> Hail Tobbi!
[2015/10/26 16:58:23] * jesusalva laughs a little.
[2015/10/26 16:58:31] * Karkus sniggers
[2015/10/26 16:58:34] <Hume2> Could you stop please?
[2015/10/26 16:58:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: As a German, I am pretty much opposed to the word "hail", it reminds me of some unpleasant things.
[2015/10/26 16:58:42] <jesusalva> I know it.
[2015/10/26 16:58:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: Right, sorry.
[2015/10/26 16:59:09] <Tobbi> It's okay...
[2015/10/26 16:59:14] <brmbrmcar> When is 1.0.0?
[2015/10/26 16:59:20] <Karkus> 2032
[2015/10/26 16:59:30] <jesusalva> I'm here just for the fish and the coins. :)
[2015/10/26 16:59:33] <Hume2> I just wanted to write the same.
[2015/10/26 16:59:37] <Karkus> or not. I am a little confused I have to admit
[2015/10/26 16:59:38] <jesusalva> Wait, is there fishes on our levels??
[2015/10/26 16:59:49] <Tobbi> I believe the project will be dormant in 2032...Or even run on ultra 3d computers...
[2015/10/26 16:59:54] <Karkus> jesusalva: In the ice, yes
[2015/10/26 16:59:56] <Tobbi> with just the same content.
[2015/10/26 17:00:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: SDL 4000
[2015/10/26 17:00:07] <brmbrmcar> No, Milestone 3 is 2032. I asked 1.0.0, which is different.
[2015/10/26 17:00:12] <Tobbi> Ultra fast high-powered GPU, just to run SuperTux :D
[2015/10/26 17:00:16] <Tobbi> What a waste.
[2015/10/26 17:00:17] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/26 17:00:24] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: They might be the same thing
[2015/10/26 17:00:27] <brmbrmcar> 99999 fps.
[2015/10/26 17:00:38] <brmbrmcar> Really?
[2015/10/26 17:00:48] <jesusalva> Tobbi: And be sure people will still play Galaga and such. :)
[2015/10/26 17:00:55] <jesusalva> Tetris even. :)
[2015/10/26 17:00:55] <Hume2> 99999 fps on Linux, 0.2 on Windows.
[2015/10/26 17:01:02] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/26 17:01:05] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: No one really know what the number will be when a milestone is released
[2015/10/26 17:01:07] <Tobbi> Pacman :D
[2015/10/26 17:01:26] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Correct.
[2015/10/26 17:01:39] <brmbrmcar> You mean 0.02.
[2015/10/26 17:01:55] <Karkus> 2 * 10^-100
[2015/10/26 17:01:59] <jesusalva> A time particle per second. A second haves 10^24 time particles.
[2015/10/26 17:02:00] <Hume2> Yes, I did.
[2015/10/26 17:02:35] <brmbrmcar> Ubuntu 32.04.
[2015/10/26 17:02:40] <Karkus> jesusalva: That doesn't work.
[2015/10/26 17:02:57] <Karkus> jesusalva: You mean 1 frame per time particle
[2015/10/26 17:02:57] <jesusalva> Uh?
[2015/10/26 17:03:01] <Karkus> :)
[2015/10/26 17:03:11] <jesusalva> It depends. Linux or Windows?
[2015/10/26 17:03:18] <Karkus> Mac OSX
[2015/10/26 17:03:39] <jesusalva> Um, it would be terrible for #freedroid if Microsoft closed doors on this meantime...

[2015/10/26 17:04:26] <Karkus> I am seriously considering setting the due date for Post 0.4.0 to 2032
[2015/10/26 17:04:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: Do it.
[2015/10/26 17:04:40] <Tobbi> It's not like people care :D
[2015/10/26 17:04:51] <Tobbi> Karkus: Or set it to INT_MAX
[2015/10/26 17:05:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: But I don't want to get their hopes up...
[2015/10/26 17:05:07] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/26 17:05:11] <Tobbi> for INT_MAX?
[2015/10/26 17:05:12] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/26 17:05:47] <jesusalva> The relase year can be calculated based on the number of features you want to do.
[2015/10/26 17:06:00] <Karkus> I have set it to halloween of 2032, we can do something special.
[2015/10/26 17:06:08] <jesusalva> Plus bugfixing. Oh yeah. :/
[2015/10/26 17:06:11] <Tobbi> I won't be around then.
[2015/10/26 17:06:17] <Karkus> maybe add another level to halloween 2014?
[2015/10/26 17:06:40] <Karkus> Tobbi: No? Are you sure?
[2015/10/26 17:06:48] <Karkus> :D
[2015/10/26 17:06:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't intend to.
[2015/10/26 17:06:51] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/26 17:06:56] <jesusalva> Why? Are you 103 years old, Tobbi€?
[2015/10/26 17:07:05] <Tobbi> I intend to have a wife and kids, and a normal life.
[2015/10/26 17:07:09] <Tobbi> Well, not sure about kids...
[2015/10/26 17:07:18] <jesusalva> And a happy penguin of pet.
[2015/10/26 17:07:23] <Karkus> Tobbi: SuperTux is your metaphorical child
[2015/10/26 17:07:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't treat all my children with that much disgust...no...
[2015/10/26 17:07:52] <jesusalva> I mean, who like dogs and cats when penguins are so better...!
[2015/10/26 17:08:04] <Hume2> I'm not sure even about the wife. :D
[2015/10/26 17:08:28] <Tobbi> Hume2: Honestly?
[2015/10/26 17:08:45] <Hume2> Tobbi: Yes, honestly.
[2015/10/26 17:08:55] <Karkus> Have they created self-impregnation by then?
[2015/10/26 17:09:05] <Tobbi> Hume2: Not sure about wanting to have a partner at all? Or about the gender?
[2015/10/26 17:09:31] <jesusalva> Then your wife leave you on the altar and says she wanted a Supertux Lead Programmer for husband, not a ordinary average guy to marry. ;)
[2015/10/26 17:09:33] <Hume2> Tobbi: I'm just kind of llama for that.
[2015/10/26 17:09:50] <Karkus> jesusalva: That's the reason I'm here too :P
[2015/10/26 17:09:52] <Tobbi> I don't understand...
[2015/10/26 17:10:06] <Karkus> Tobbi: Any gender you like
[2015/10/26 17:10:10] <Tobbi> jesusalva: ... Girls are not into programmers...
[2015/10/26 17:10:26] <Tobbi> Or should I say "Girls are not into nerds"
[2015/10/26 17:10:48] <Tobbi> :D nv
[2015/10/26 17:10:49] <Tobbi> m
[2015/10/26 17:10:51] <Karkus> Or as I say "Girls are not into me". Forever alone...
[2015/10/26 17:11:20] <Hume2> Tobbi: You're right. I shouldn't give it up.
[2015/10/26 17:11:35] <Tobbi> Hume2: You shouldn't give up.
[2015/10/26 17:12:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe that it's a myth I have been following for way too long...
[2015/10/26 17:12:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's a fairly common misconception
[2015/10/26 17:12:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am not exactly nerdy. I am just shy in real life.
[2015/10/26 17:12:56] <Tobbi> Extremely. shy.
[2015/10/26 17:13:20] <jesusalva> Tobbi: I am introverted and shy. Duh.
[2015/10/26 17:13:21] <Karkus> I don't think I'm shy, but I am very introverted...
[2015/10/26 17:13:52] <Karkus> Not very, I guess
[2015/10/26 17:14:12] <Hume2> I must go, Bye! (now seriously)
[2015/10/26 17:14:17] <Tobbi> I am shy, too.
[2015/10/26 17:14:19] <Karkus> Hume2: cya
[2015/10/26 17:14:25] @ Quit: Hume2: Quit: Page closed
[2015/10/26 17:14:25] <Tobbi> Introverted, no.
[2015/10/26 17:15:21] <jesusalva> Tobbi: It's all a question of how you sell yourself, not if you're nerd or not.
[2015/10/26 17:15:28] <Tobbi> jesusalva: I know...
[2015/10/26 17:15:43] <Tobbi> And I perceive myself way too critical...
[2015/10/26 17:15:50] <jesusalva> If a girl dislikes you then she is not worth you. Sorry to say, marrying her will make your life a hell.
[2015/10/26 17:15:57] <Tobbi> But it's always been that way...
[2015/10/26 17:16:02] <Karkus> My solution to being self-critical is to stop caring what others think
[2015/10/26 17:16:38] <Tobbi> jesusalva: Who talks about marriage.
[2015/10/26 17:16:39] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/10/26 17:16:52] <Tobbi> Karkus: easier said than done ;)
[2015/10/26 17:17:09] <jesusalva> It's easy to ignore others, but first you must get used to.

[2015/10/26 17:17:43] <leyyin> oh man, you are so wrong
[2015/10/26 17:17:46] <Tobbi> leyyin: Really?
[2015/10/26 17:17:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: I have experience. Sometimes I am scared to do speeches and things but then I stop giving shits.

[2015/10/26 17:18:35] <Tobbi> That's why none of them are left for me :D
[2015/10/26 17:18:38] <leyyin> nerdy girls like nerdy guys
[2015/10/26 17:18:39] <leyyin> duh
[2015/10/26 17:18:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: But nerdy guys don't necessarily like nerdy girls...
[2015/10/26 17:18:52] <jesusalva> Smart and clever do as well.
[2015/10/26 17:18:52] <leyyin> and some of them looks very nice
[2015/10/26 17:18:55] <Karkus> hopefully...
[2015/10/26 17:19:34] <jesusalva> "Looks nice" is a question of personality. You can only decide that after knowing that someone. Physical appearance can be frustating.
[2015/10/26 17:19:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hmm, now you're being picky :P
[2015/10/26 17:19:55] <jesusalva> You may choose the book by the cover, but you cannot judge because it.
[2015/10/26 17:20:10] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't like nerdy girls that much. I prefer more the normal girl...
[2015/10/26 17:20:15] <leyyin> nerdy usually means a nice personality
[2015/10/26 17:20:28] <Tobbi> leyyin: I mean: People you can talk about all kinds of things with.
[2015/10/26 17:20:44] <leyyin> nerdy girls can do that...
[2015/10/26 17:20:53] <Karkus> You can talk about anything with anyone
[2015/10/26 17:20:57] <leyyin> ^
[2015/10/26 17:21:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Is it honestly that bad?
[2015/10/26 17:21:13] <Tobbi> head8debian: What is bad?
[2015/10/26 17:21:18] <Karkus> Whether they listen, though,
[2015/10/26 17:21:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know...
[2015/10/26 17:21:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: People perceive me as too much of the nerdy type, I believe. Reason for that is that I have never actually showed anything else to other people...
[2015/10/26 17:21:51] <leyyin> Tobbi, stop being so picky,,,,
[2015/10/26 17:21:52] <Tobbi> because of fear...
[2015/10/26 17:22:24] <Karkus> If someone isn't going to listen then they aren't worth it, unless of course you spend time talking about yourself...
[2015/10/26 17:22:24] <Tobbi> leyyin: But, wait, I am intelligent, good-looking, successful, awesome, trustworthy, nice, etc. and I want a suitable match :D
[2015/10/26 17:22:55] <Karkus> No one can match you Tobbi :P

[2015/10/26 17:25:39] <head8debian> I...did...
[2015/10/26 17:25:46] <head8debian> what else is there to add?
[2015/10/26 17:26:02] <head8debian> Good grief...
[2015/10/26 17:26:18] <head8debian> Did you merge Mr Candle yet? :D
[2015/10/26 17:26:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, let me check again.
[2015/10/26 17:26:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yes, today...
[2015/10/26 17:26:31] <Tobbi> (I believe)
[2015/10/26 17:26:34] <Tobbi> wait, did I?
[2015/10/26 17:26:39] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/26 17:26:46] <Tobbi> Yes, I did.
[2015/10/26 17:27:14] <brmbrmcar> Ubuntu 32.04 should exist.
[2015/10/26 17:27:26] * head8debian rolls his eyes...
[2015/10/26 17:27:27] <Karkus> head8debian: Macbuntu... Very good.
[2015/10/26 17:27:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: So, you need any signs made? I can do it.
[2015/10/26 17:27:58] <Karkus> Also it's not ubuntu itself it's canonical
[2015/10/26 17:27:59] <brmbrmcar> I hate Apple.
[2015/10/26 17:28:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: You know the big explanation signs?
[2015/10/26 17:28:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: Also, did we merge the new cloud that was made for us?
[2015/10/26 17:28:08] <head8debian> Yes?
[2015/10/26 17:28:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: We're missing tile ids.
[2015/10/26 17:28:14] <Karkus> head8debian: Well, there are no levels with it in yet!
[2015/10/26 17:28:22] <Tobbi> head8debian: And I want one of those big explanation signs for the new badguy.
[2015/10/26 17:28:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Still...
[2015/10/26 17:28:32] <brmbrmcar> I want my own distro.
[2015/10/26 17:28:35] <Karkus> head8debian: Is it just a cloud.
[2015/10/26 17:28:43] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: With what in it?
[2015/10/26 17:29:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes, but merge the cloud so i can add ids?
[2015/10/26 17:29:03] <brmbrmcar> Mr CAndle looks too much like a candle.
[2015/10/26 17:29:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, sure.
[2015/10/26 17:29:24] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: He walks, so that's okay.

[2015/10/26 17:31:29] <Tobbi> Actually, I believe mt did.
[2015/10/26 17:31:45] <head8debian> Good.

[2015/10/26 17:33:00] <Tobbi> Okay, good.

[2015/10/26 17:33:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: can we check tomorrow? I really have to finish this before some reasonable time...
[2015/10/26 17:33:33] <head8debian> Its telling me that the image you just merged is 1 byte and it won't open.
[2015/10/26 17:33:41] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: What OS are you on atm?
[2015/10/26 17:34:01] <Tobbi> Oh!

[2015/10/26 17:37:36] <Tobbi> Maybe I should unignore brmbrmcar, it's weird that you guys seem to be talking to a ghost.
[2015/10/26 17:37:36] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Do you like it?
[2015/10/26 17:38:02] <leyyin> Karkus, no, unreal engine ;)
[2015/10/26 17:38:13] <Karkus> leyyin: Sigh
[2015/10/26 17:38:41] <Karkus> leyyin: I tried to use Unity but it made me cry so I went back to vim.
[2015/10/26 17:38:50] <brmbrmcar> It's alright.
[2015/10/26 17:39:17] <leyyin> Karkus, everybody knows that editor wars are pointless
[2015/10/26 17:39:26] <leyyin> and emacs is the only one true editor
[2015/10/26 17:39:31] <leyyin> and unity is not an editor
[2015/10/26 17:40:13] <Karkus> leyyin: I know I know. But I still went back to vim because it has a more intuitive and simple UI
[2015/10/26 17:40:25] <leyyin> vim does not have an UI....
[2015/10/26 17:40:40] <Karkus> leyyin: I'm joking :P
[2015/10/26 17:40:54] <Tobbi> Guys, please...
[2015/10/26 17:40:56] <Karkus> leyyin: Also, an UI or a UI?
[2015/10/26 17:41:13] <Tobbi> Otherwise I'll tell you guys that Firefox is the best browser because I did an internship at Mozilla...
[2015/10/26 17:41:14] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/10/26 17:41:22] <Tobbi> haha, i know you guys love to hear it over and over again :D

[2015/10/26 17:41:47] <Tobbi> I know it...
[2015/10/26 17:41:49] <Karkus> leyyin: I wouldn't

[2015/10/27 15:03:21] <Tobbi> It is still there.

[2015/10/27 15:04:37] <brmbrmcar> Who cares.
[2015/10/27 15:04:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: Markdown is what the GitHub wiki uses

[2015/10/27 15:06:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: So how to solve this problem?
[2015/10/27 15:06:44] <Karkus> We have 2 wikis
[2015/10/27 15:06:51] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't know, maybe we should even close the relevant issue.
[2015/10/27 15:06:54] <Karkus> One is old, the other is markdown
[2015/10/27 15:06:56] <Tobbi> Maybe it was just a bad idea.
[2015/10/27 15:07:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: You do realise closing issues doesn't fix the problems?
[2015/10/27 15:07:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: The problem of having two wikis?
[2015/10/27 15:07:31] <Karkus> :P
[2015/10/27 15:07:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: We have been "solving" a lot of issues by closing them :D
[2015/10/27 15:08:04] <brmbrmcar> Use the old one. Supertux should be independent.
[2015/10/27 15:08:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: We have two wikis, neither of which appear to be sufficient
[2015/10/27 15:08:33] <Tobbi> gosh...
[2015/10/27 15:08:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: I was in favour of the new wiki to have everything in place...
[2015/10/27 15:08:49] <Tobbi> But I am not sure...
[2015/10/27 15:09:00] <Tobbi> Karkus: Also, which issues were closed but not solved?
[2015/10/27 15:10:45] <Karkus> Tobbi: None, really but https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/201 and others were closed without solving, of course, many needed to be closed, but a habit of closing an issue that we dont like isnt a good one :/
[2015/10/27 15:11:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, agreed...
[2015/10/27 15:11:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: So thats why I opened this: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/208
[2015/10/27 15:11:58] <Karkus> But then...
[2015/10/27 15:12:16] <Tobbi> *sigh* I am not sure.
[2015/10/27 15:13:26] <Karkus> It's not really a solution...
[2015/10/27 15:13:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: Can we have both wikis co-exist for the near future?
[2015/10/27 15:14:05] <brmbrmcar> Use the old one.
[2015/10/27 15:14:13] <Tobbi> Porting things over is quite...a lot of work...and the new wiki...well, not sure what to think of it.
[2015/10/27 15:14:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: That is inevitable, but I'm with brmbrmcar
[2015/10/27 15:14:24] <Tobbi> fine.
[2015/10/27 15:14:25] <Karkus> We should stick
[2015/10/27 15:14:30] <brmbrmcar> Yes!
[2015/10/27 15:15:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, not fine. We need to have it agreed, and that's why I opened a vote. If head8debian doesn't argue, we can open that issue and see what other people think

[2015/10/27 15:56:07] <Hume2> It looks like my Winerr api, that had to be a revenge for Windows 8 on school computers.
[2015/10/27 15:56:41] <Hume2> It threw totally absurd errors.
[2015/10/27 15:57:15] <brmbrmcar> I hate Windows.
[2015/10/27 15:57:25] <Hume2> Same for me.
[2015/10/27 15:57:37] <Hume2> That's why I was workinbg on it.
[2015/10/27 15:58:15] <Hume2> There's a way how to hide it to the computer, so noone notices that it's here.
[2015/10/27 15:58:45] <brmbrmcar> I want to destroy Windows 8.
[2015/10/27 15:59:07] <brmbrmcar> Windows is insecure, right?
[2015/10/27 15:59:32] <Hume2> Yes, right.
[2015/10/27 16:00:11] <brmbrmcar> So a hack to the update system that deletes Windows?
[2015/10/27 16:00:15] <Hume2> The security of Windows: Disable all useful functions, so you can't hack into it manually. However, viruses can bypass it.
[2015/10/27 16:01:01] <brmbrmcar> Yes!
[2015/10/27 16:01:17] <Hume2> I also wrote a WBScript that lags the computer entirely in 10 minutes after boot.
[2015/10/27 16:02:03] <Hume2> It launches the same WBScript in each tick, so it has tendency to go exponentially.
[2015/10/27 16:02:24] <brmbrmcar> Awesome!
[2015/10/27 16:03:22] <brmbrmcar> Make it lag forever.
[2015/10/27 16:04:35] <Hume2> It used to be in Narre's school's computers in post-process, until they upgraded their security.
[2015/10/27 16:04:55] <Hume2> About a half of computers had a lollious defect.
[2015/10/27 16:05:10] <brmbrmcar> School systems are easy to hack.
[2015/10/27 16:05:20] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2015/10/27 16:06:11] <Hume2> And the students also were setting the system time to year 2099 in BIOS and the teachers just wondered how is that possible.
[2015/10/27 16:06:17] <brmbrmcar> Even easier nowadays they upload all the files to the internet.
[2015/10/27 16:06:48] <Hume2> Yes. What about a virus, that torrents itself?
[2015/10/27 16:06:50] <brmbrmcar> And there is always a student with Password as a password.
[2015/10/27 16:06:57] <Hume2> :D
[2015/10/27 16:08:24] <Hume2> Self torrenting viruses... When you delete them, they reappear :D
[2015/10/27 16:08:24] <brmbrmcar> All the files without any hacks neccesary.

[2015/10/27 16:10:31] <Hume2> For example, imagine a message box, that reappears twice when you close it.

[2015/10/27 16:24:00] <brmbrmcar> I agree.

[2015/10/27 18:48:16] <Mathnerd314> maybe something like "fix 5 bugs", except you've already done that so it would be too easy

[2015/10/28 09:11:45] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I got that the Nolok's statue is an optical illusion.
[2015/10/28 09:12:02] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2015/10/28 09:12:27] <brmbrmcar> What's the Nolok boss?
[2015/10/28 09:13:10] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I thought that it's a dog, but it isn't.
[2015/10/28 09:13:23] <brmbrmcar> I like dogs.
[2015/10/28 09:13:40] <Hume2> I too.
[2015/10/28 09:14:23] <Hume2> Did you thought it too that it's a dog, or you see clearly the crocodile-look?
[2015/10/28 09:15:05] <brmbrmcar> A bit.
[2015/10/28 09:16:23] <Hume2> I got that the thing that looks like the dog's mouth are the Nolok's hands.
[2015/10/28 09:21:35] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/10/28 09:22:33] <brmbrmcar> It is very wierd indeed.
[2015/10/28 09:23:52] <Hume2> It confused Grumbel too. Citation form Grumbel grumbles: nolok doesn't caputure the essence of the statue
[2015/10/28 09:24:24] <brmbrmcar> Is it deliberate?
[2015/10/28 09:25:36] <Hume2> I don't know. I'll try to add a shadow to the hands to make it less confusing.
[2015/10/28 09:25:58] <brmbrmcar> That would definitely be better.

[2015/10/28 15:44:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, rather :-(
[2015/10/28 15:44:15] <head8debian> Heh.
[2015/10/28 15:44:17] <Tobbi> I'm parsing CAT images...
[2015/10/28 15:47:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats that mean?
[2015/10/28 15:48:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: You know, computer aided tomography?

[2015/10/28 15:49:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: Oh, CAT as in CAT scan.
[2015/10/28 15:49:06] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/10/28 15:49:50] <Tobbi> head8debian: Ever been inside such a device?
[2015/10/28 15:51:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Nope. Thankfully. :)
[2015/10/28 15:51:36] <brmbrmcar> How did you get cloaks?
[2015/10/28 15:51:49] <Tobbi> head8debian: I was in an MRI device a couple years ago.
[2015/10/28 15:51:52] <Tobbi> I believe 10 or so.
[2015/10/28 15:52:29] <brmbrmcar> 10?
[2015/10/28 15:53:07] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: 10 years ago, I was in an MRI scanner
[2015/10/28 15:53:31] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2015/10/28 15:53:35] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Go into #freenode and ask politely for a cloak.
[2015/10/28 15:53:41] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: And wait.
[2015/10/28 15:53:53] <Tobbi> And don't be as annoying as usually...
[2015/10/28 15:53:55] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: And your nick must be registered.
[2015/10/28 15:53:55] <brmbrmcar> OK.

[2015/10/28 15:56:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Wow... Have you read to microsoft EULA?
[2015/10/28 15:56:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do you believe I have too much time at my hands?
[2015/10/28 15:56:49] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its short. :D
[2015/10/28 15:56:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Link?
[2015/10/28 15:57:05] <head8debian> I was jsut wondering if you have in the past.
[2015/10/28 15:57:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: I almost never read EULAs.
[2015/10/28 15:57:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: http://support2.microsoft.com/gp/mats_eula
[2015/10/28 15:57:28] <Tobbi> You can carry all your EULAs to Athens.
[2015/10/28 15:57:54] <Tobbi> We have a saying in Germany "EULAs nach Athen tragen"
[2015/10/28 15:57:56] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/28 15:58:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: And whats that mean?
[2015/10/28 15:59:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: Actually, it's "Eulen nach Athen tragen" -> To carry owls to Athens.
[2015/10/28 15:59:28] <Tobbi> But since you mentioned EULAs, I guess I changed it a bit.
[2015/10/28 15:59:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: What is athens?
[2015/10/28 15:59:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: *sigh* Capital of Greece.
[2015/10/28 15:59:59] * head8debian is even mroe confused...

[2015/10/28 16:00:13] <Tobbi> head8debian: You know what greece is, right?
[2015/10/28 16:00:18] <Tobbi> And I don't mean the musical.
[2015/10/28 16:00:21] <Tobbi> Nor do I mean grace.
[2015/10/28 16:00:21] <head8debian> Open Source rocks... even ubuntu is better...
[2015/10/28 16:00:23] <head8debian> Yes.
[2015/10/28 16:00:26] <head8debian> YES!
[2015/10/28 16:00:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Capital City of Greece is Athens.
[2015/10/28 16:01:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: The joke is no good when you have to explain it...
[2015/10/28 16:01:13] <Tobbi> Okay, okay, I'll stop :D
[2015/10/28 16:01:49] <brmbrmcar> I wish the idiots on #freenode would do the same...
[2015/10/28 16:02:00] <brmbrmcar> You thought I was bad.
[2015/10/28 16:02:16] <leyyin> muricans do not know geography?
[2015/10/28 16:02:19] <leyyin> what a shocker
[2015/10/28 16:02:30] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yeah, I am fairly shocked as well.
[2015/10/28 16:02:43] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Yes, we did, and still do, think that.

[2015/10/28 16:03:14] <leyyin> it's in a place called "EUROPE"
[2015/10/28 16:03:15] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Your seeing #freenode at its worst. ;) Usually its quiet and clean.
[2015/10/28 16:03:16] <leyyin> exotic!
[2015/10/28 16:03:42] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: But just ask and wait and be quiet. If you don't get a response in 1 hour repost your question.
[2015/10/28 16:04:03] <head8debian> Tobbi: Too crowded for me. :)
[2015/10/28 16:04:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: You meant "1 second"
[2015/10/28 16:04:17] <Tobbi> head8debian: Also, "crowded???"
[2015/10/28 16:04:17] <brmbrmcar> I will try...

[2015/10/28 16:05:38] <head8debian> :)

[2015/10/28 16:05:54] <leyyin> I can give you small villages with only 1000 people
[2015/10/28 16:06:12] <Tobbi> I can give you small villages with only 1 person.
[2015/10/28 16:06:21] <brmbrmcar> 0.1 people.
[2015/10/28 16:06:39] <brmbrmcar> They count 0.
[2015/10/28 16:07:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: Is this better? This is our nearest town. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Rapids%2C_Michigan
[2015/10/28 16:07:05] <head8debian> 30 miles.
[2015/10/28 16:07:19] <brmbrmcar> 48 kilometers.
[2015/10/28 16:07:26] <Tobbi> Way too big.
[2015/10/28 16:07:27] <leyyin> haha ^

[2015/10/28 16:07:47] <Tobbi> Better than Cedar Rapids, though.
[2015/10/28 16:07:50] <head8debian> Hehe.
[2015/10/28 16:11:25] <Tobbi> By the way: It's Wednesday...and what does that mean?

[2015/10/28 16:16:07] <brmbrmcar> Better not.
[2015/10/28 16:16:09] <leyyin> well you can drink, but not get drunk
[2015/10/28 16:16:16] <leyyin> getting drunk is the bad part
[2015/10/28 16:16:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: I will probably just talk...
[2015/10/28 16:16:29] <Tobbi> leyyin: Problem is: I'm too shy when I'm not drunk :D
[2015/10/28 16:16:47] <leyyin> sigh, german pussies :P

[2015/10/29 10:07:00] <datahead8888> How go milestone 2 and the level editor?
[2015/10/29 10:07:02] @ Quit: darkbasic: Read error: Connection reset by peer
[2015/10/29 10:07:07] @ darkbasic_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/29 10:07:24] <Hume2> Hi, datahead8888. I didn't have much time for it.
[2015/10/29 10:07:40] <datahead8888> I understand the feeling
[2015/10/29 10:07:48] <datahead8888> Did you mean not much time for the level editor or milestone 2?
[2015/10/29 10:09:14] <Hume2> Yes. The 0.4.0 will be released in one month and there are still some bugs.
[2015/10/29 10:09:36] <datahead8888> You could always delay it if you need to
[2015/10/29 10:09:52] <Hume2> I know. I'll do it most likely.
[2015/10/29 10:09:53] <datahead8888> If you're still adding some features and then need to go through bugs after that, I think delaying it might make sense
[2015/10/29 10:10:04] <datahead8888> It would be better to wait for a stable release than release an unstable one
[2015/10/29 10:10:54] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2015/10/29 10:11:12] <Hume2> There are still some bugs in the editor those I can't solve.
[2015/10/29 10:12:27] <datahead8888> Do you know what release the editor is going into?
[2015/10/29 10:13:12] <Hume2> If I manage to force the others to work on it, it will be in  0.4.1.
[2015/10/29 10:14:04] <Hume2> Anyway, what do you say to my new Nolok's statue? https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/210/files
[2015/10/29 10:14:05] <datahead8888> I see.  That would not be milestone 2, though, would it?
[2015/10/29 10:14:14] <datahead8888> Unless I misunderstood
[2015/10/29 10:14:49] <datahead8888> The new Nolok statue is a little too black around the chest
[2015/10/29 10:14:59] <datahead8888> But good otherwise
[2015/10/29 10:15:01] <Hume2> I think that 0.4.1 is milestone 3, or at least something between 2 and 3.
[2015/10/29 10:15:15] <datahead8888> Yes, that would have been my assumption for 0.4.1
[2015/10/29 10:15:32] <datahead8888> I'd excited to hear milestone 2 is finishing up :)
[2015/10/29 10:15:37] <datahead8888> Then we can look forward to milestone 3 :)
[2015/10/29 10:16:16] <Hume2> Milestone 3, finally :)
[2015/10/29 10:17:18] <datahead8888> Indeed
[2015/10/29 10:17:27] <datahead8888> Then everyone can shoot for 3-5 big worlds
[2015/10/29 10:18:14] <Hume2> We really need more worlds.
[2015/10/29 10:18:17] <datahead8888> It is only a matter of time before this game blows the socks of of Super Mario World and other Mario games :)
[2015/10/29 10:18:22] <datahead8888> Hume2, yes, we do
[2015/10/29 10:18:33] <datahead8888> This is what will allow Super Tux to really compete with Mario
[2015/10/29 10:18:48] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2015/10/29 10:19:52] <datahead8888> Oh, you guys have Arabic; that's good
[2015/10/29 10:20:05] <datahead8888> Do you have Chinese?
[2015/10/29 10:20:14] <datahead8888> (Mandarin)?
[2015/10/29 10:21:33] <Hume2> There are at least some chineese letters, but I don't know which.
[2015/10/29 10:22:15] <datahead8888> I see
[2015/10/29 10:22:27] <datahead8888> Yeah, we don't have any Asian languages for Secret Chronicles yet
[2015/10/29 10:23:03] <datahead8888> I probably need to get around to building Super Tux from source.  Then I can nag Sydney when I run into issues :P
[2015/10/29 10:24:26] <Hume2> I got a problem: SuperTux doesn't recognize right clicks.
[2015/10/29 10:24:45] <Hume2> So I use ctrl-left click as right click.
[2015/10/29 10:27:05] <datahead8888> It doesn't recognize right clicks?
[2015/10/29 10:27:14] <datahead8888> You ought to change the code to allow that, long term
[2015/10/29 10:27:32] <Hume2> Yes. It recognizes only left clicks.
[2015/10/29 10:28:03] <Hume2> That's one of the chenges that someone should do.
[2015/10/29 10:28:39] <datahead8888> There should be a task then :)
[2015/10/29 10:28:46] <datahead8888> Tasks don't seem to last long in the tracker for Super Tux
[2015/10/29 10:29:10] <datahead8888> No Task is always bad when something needs to be done...
[2015/10/29 10:29:38] @ Mathnerd314 joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/29 10:30:25] <Hume2> I know. I didn't pushed any commits to the editor branch, because it could rage someone.
[2015/10/29 10:31:54] <datahead8888> Oh, I see
[2015/10/29 10:32:10] <datahead8888> If right clicks are only needed for the editor, you have to wait to merge your editor changes into the main branch
[2015/10/29 10:33:14] <Hume2> ctrl+left click work too. So after there will be right clicks, it will be OK. However, this doesn't prevent me from making progress.
[2015/10/29 10:35:53] <datahead8888> You could implement right click inside of your editor branch
[2015/10/29 10:37:01] <Hume2> I'd like to know how.
[2015/10/29 10:41:47] <datahead8888> I don't know the Super Tux code.  I just meant you could make your changes there if they will not be accepted in the main branch

[2015/10/29 12:02:17] <Hume2> I've once made 1000 levels, but all to Milestone 1 and very very crappy.
[2015/10/29 12:02:23] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/29 12:02:40] <Hume2> It was called TeraTux.
[2015/10/29 12:03:15] <Hume2> So when I say that it's crappy as TeraTux, it means very crappy.
[2015/10/29 12:03:55] <brmbrmcar> Mine are very bad.
[2015/10/29 12:04:07] <brmbrmcar> All scripts.
[2015/10/29 12:05:27] <Hume2> I guess that it's still much better than TeraTux was.
[2015/10/29 12:06:35] <brmbrmcar> It's about the island getting new inhabitants, who have killed Nolok.
[2015/10/29 12:07:11] <brmbrmcar> Due to a misunderstanding, they start to hate Tux.#
[2015/10/29 12:08:02] <Karkus> Hume2: What IDE do you use for C++?

[2015/10/29 12:09:17] <Hume2_> brmbrmcar: An average TeraTux level: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1Ocnt79mII
[2015/10/29 12:09:24] <Hume2_> Sorry for the quality.

[2015/10/29 12:09:51] <Karkus> O.o
[2015/10/29 12:10:56] <Hume2_> Levels 501 - 900 are much longer, but they are copied many times.
[2015/10/29 12:11:23] <Hume2_> All the levels 501 - 549 and 501 - 599 are the same.
[2015/10/29 12:11:46] <Hume2_> All the levels 601 - 649 are the same.
[2015/10/29 12:12:08] <Hume2_> And all the levels 651 - 699 are the same.
[2015/10/29 12:18:14] <brmbrmcar> Mine are all the same, almost!
[2015/10/29 12:18:48] <brmbrmcar> How long did the worldmap take you to make?
[2015/10/29 12:19:23] <Hume2_> I did it about 2 years, but I had many pauses in it.
[2015/10/29 12:20:06] <Hume2_> So it was more like 100 days if I worked continuously.
[2015/10/29 12:20:07] <brmbrmcar> Most of my levels I made in the past week.
[2015/10/29 12:20:59] <Hume2_> I'll just explain you what the "all the same levels" means.
[2015/10/29 12:21:03] @ Quit: tuxdev_: Ping timeout: 260 seconds
[2015/10/29 12:21:08] <Hume2_> It means that they are copied.
[2015/10/29 12:21:41] <Hume2_> I wanted to finish it finally, so I toke one level and copied it 98 times.
[2015/10/29 12:22:27] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2015/10/29 12:23:05] <Hume2_> ...but I guess that noone got that when TeraTux was actual, because I'm the only one who passed trough all those levels.
[2015/10/29 12:23:14] <brmbrmcar> What version was it?
[2015/10/29 12:23:20] <Hume2_> 0.1.3
[2015/10/29 12:23:38] <Hume2_> Or do you mean TeraTux version?
[2015/10/29 12:23:40] <brmbrmcar> Ooh,
[2015/10/29 12:24:00] <brmbrmcar> Number 350 has a lot of views!
[2015/10/29 12:25:16] <Hume2_> It's possible, because I gave up broadcasting when I reached the level 350.
[2015/10/29 12:25:43] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2015/10/29 12:25:51] <brmbrmcar> That will be why.

[2015/10/29 12:31:02] <brmbrmcar> All pages except the front one.
[2015/10/29 12:31:21] <Hume2> There are more locked pages.
[2015/10/29 12:31:41] <brmbrmcar> I  have done a lot of editing.
[2015/10/29 12:31:48] <Hume2> I can edit the pages too, but not the locked ones.
[2015/10/29 12:32:00] <Hume2> ...because of Giby.
[2015/10/29 12:33:45] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2015/10/29 12:33:55] <brmbrmcar> What dif Giby do?
[2015/10/29 12:34:05] <Karkus> Hume2: It's better that way. Ask Tobbi if you need to and of course he will promote you

[2015/10/29 12:34:17] <Karkus> He locked the important pages
[2015/10/29 12:35:00] <brmbrmcar> {{Level list Icy Island}} should be locked.
[2015/10/29 12:35:03] <Hume2> Giby trolled me with his off-line mode and he thought that I'm a vandal.
[2015/10/29 12:36:20] <brmbrmcar> Naughty Giby.
[2015/10/29 12:38:27] <Hume2> Well, maybe I vandalized it a bit, but his reactions were insane.
[2015/10/29 12:40:00] <Hume2> LMH told me what I did wrong and I've corrected it, but Giby didn't stopped with his complains.
[2015/10/29 12:40:12] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/10/29 12:40:41] <Hume2> He blamed me for the same thing each day.
[2015/10/29 12:40:55] <brmbrmcar> That is very bad.
[2015/10/29 12:41:18] <Hume2> I don't have any other explanation than a forgotten off-line mode.
[2015/10/29 12:42:03] <brmbrmcar> Have I been bad?
[2015/10/29 12:42:29] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I personally don't have any problems with you.
[2015/10/29 12:42:34] <brmbrmcar> I mean on there.
[2015/10/29 12:43:24] <Hume2> I don't know what you think. Could you specify it more?
[2015/10/29 12:43:43] <brmbrmcar> On my edits.
[2015/10/29 12:44:37] <brmbrmcar> http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&limit=500&days=30
[2015/10/29 12:45:41] <Hume2> It's OK.
[2015/10/29 12:46:32] <brmbrmcar> No complaints from Giby?
[2015/10/29 12:46:50] <Hume2> I don't have any now.
[2015/10/29 12:47:30] <Hume2> The thing that Giby complained were rapid changes in long-term plans.
[2015/10/29 12:48:03] <Karkus> Hume2: We don't rush things :P
[2015/10/29 12:48:17] <Hume2> I know.
[2015/10/29 12:48:31] <brmbrmcar> LOng term plans can be rushed. They are not major for the present.
[2015/10/29 12:48:49] <Hume2> That's what I thought.
[2015/10/29 12:49:15] <brmbrmcar> I mean, be more careful later, but it is all ideas.
[2015/10/29 12:50:06] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: That's true, actually
[2015/10/29 12:50:06] <Hume2> In fact, he was the only one who "discussed" about that with me.
[2015/10/29 12:50:46] <Karkus> I am compiling cmake using cmake O.o Inception
[2015/10/29 12:50:58] <Hume2> :D
[2015/10/29 12:51:25] <Karkus> the apt package was 2.8 and I want 3.4
[2015/10/29 12:51:31] <brmbrmcar> How do you compile cmake?
[2015/10/29 12:51:39] <Karkus> download the source
[2015/10/29 12:51:46] <brmbrmcar> Without cmake.
[2015/10/29 12:51:56] <Karkus> there is a configure file
[2015/10/29 12:52:09] <Karkus> makes a bash script
[2015/10/29 12:52:15] <Karkus> which does it for you
[2015/10/29 12:52:48] <Karkus> of course, sudo apt-get install cmake is all that's needed to get an old version, then mkdir build && cd build then cmake .. I guess
[2015/10/29 12:53:20] <brmbrmcar> Why doesn't Supertux do ./configure?
[2015/10/29 12:54:47] <Karkus> idk, I think cmake is simpler and more organised
[2015/10/29 12:55:05] <brmbrmcar> I don't like cmake.
[2015/10/29 12:55:15] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Why not?
[2015/10/29 12:56:02] <brmbrmcar> If something goes wrong, you need to have a lot of understanding to  see what has gone wrong.
[2015/10/29 12:56:10] <Karkus> Hume2: How do you play the level in your in-game editor?
[2015/10/29 12:56:22] <brmbrmcar> THe output is very hard to read.
[2015/10/29 12:56:26] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Same with ./configure
[2015/10/29 12:56:29] <Karkus> ?
[2015/10/29 12:56:38] <Hume2> Karkus: I didn't added that function so far.
[2015/10/29 12:56:48] <Karkus> Hume2: Oh.
[2015/10/29 12:56:59] <Karkus> That would be quite useful
[2015/10/29 12:57:05] <Karkus> :P
[2015/10/29 12:57:10] <Hume2> I know.
[2015/10/29 12:57:14] <Karkus> I might take a look at your code
[2015/10/29 12:57:22] <Karkus> I really like where it's going!
[2015/10/29 12:57:24] <Karkus> :D
[2015/10/29 12:57:31] <Hume2> The repository is outdated.
[2015/10/29 12:57:33] <brmbrmcar> Where is your level editor?
[2015/10/29 12:57:42] <Hume2> I'll just push it here.
[2015/10/29 12:57:46] <Karkus> Hume2: Okay
[2015/10/29 12:58:18] <Karkus> Hume2: I'm not that familiar with SDL though, I'm just getting used to it

[2015/10/29 18:20:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: I might have a little trouble, as I have no joystick to test this on, so I cannot be sure that what I do necessarily works for the joysticks
[2015/10/29 18:20:58] <Karkus> Tobbi_:^
[2015/10/29 18:21:17] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Neither have I.
[2015/10/29 18:21:22] <Tobbi_> Joystick support, hmm...
[2015/10/29 18:22:08] <Karkus> And it's more complex. Whether that will affect what I'm doing I cannot be sure.
[2015/10/29 18:22:14] <Karkus> Is it an on/off thing?
[2015/10/29 18:22:37] <Karkus> Maybe it's completely seperate
[2015/10/29 18:24:08] <Tobbi_> I have no idea at all.
[2015/10/29 18:24:26] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Don't worry about it, I will figure something out :D
[2015/10/29 18:24:30] <Tobbi_> ok
[2015/10/29 18:24:51] <Karkus> Do you know how to print verbose or debug output
[2015/10/29 18:25:10] <Tobbi_> Karkus: --verbose or --debug
[2015/10/29 18:25:47] <Karkus> No, I'm not clear. I mean, as the programmer. If you don't, I will see if I can find an example
[2015/10/29 18:26:02] <Karkus> If I only want something to be printed if --debug is used
[2015/10/29 18:26:07] <Karkus> for example
[2015/10/29 18:26:51] <Tobbi_> Karkus: log_debug << "My string" << std::endl;
[2015/10/29 18:27:05] <Tobbi_> Or log_verbose << "my string" << std::endl;
[2015/10/29 18:27:20] <Tobbi_> You might need to #include "util/log.hpp", though
[2015/10/29 18:27:39] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Great. Thanks!

[2015/10/29 20:28:32] <Tobbi_> Karkus: I hope this fixes it. If you can test it, that would be great ^^. If not, I tested it, by deleting certain things...
[2015/10/29 20:28:52] <Tobbi_> from the savegame file for that worldmap, leaving tux's position intact and it reset to main.
[2015/10/29 20:29:25] <Karkus> Hmm, I will test it.
[2015/10/29 20:30:01] <Karkus> Tobbi_: You know, you can recreate this scenario by reinstalling supertux
[2015/10/29 20:30:11] <Karkus> after completing some levels
[2015/10/29 20:30:19] <Karkus> I did it by mistake.
[2015/10/29 20:30:37] <Karkus> Let me see if I can recreate it, and then I will test it
[2015/10/29 20:30:43] <Tobbi_> Karkus: Weird! Tux's position and the worldmap state are saved in the same file...
[2015/10/29 20:30:52] <Tobbi_> I don't get it.
[2015/10/29 20:31:08] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I don't get what you don't get...
[2015/10/29 20:31:37] <Tobbi_> Karkus: If the savegame file gets deleted, the worldmap state should reset, but so should Tux's position.
[2015/10/29 20:31:42] <Tobbi_> Because that file gets deleted...
[2015/10/29 20:31:51] <Karkus> Oh!
[2015/10/29 20:31:53] <Tobbi_> But maybe I misunderstand something here.
[2015/10/29 20:31:56] <Karkus> Yes
[2015/10/29 20:32:04] <Karkus> The file doesnt get deleted
[2015/10/29 20:32:11] <Karkus> Maybe
[2015/10/29 20:32:17] <Tobbi_> But then, why do the levels get back to unsolved?
[2015/10/29 20:32:21] <Karkus> I honestly haven't looked
[2015/10/29 20:32:44] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Well, now you see the dilemma

[2015/10/29 20:33:43] <Karkus> Ah, no. Install, then install again is probably how I did it. So no uninstall

[2015/10/29 20:59:14] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I am mistaken. It does not look in local. There you have it, but how do we solve it?

[2015/10/30 07:17:23] <Karkus> Hume2: Okay thanks
[2015/10/30 07:17:47] <Karkus> Just wondered
[2015/10/30 07:30:14] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Do you know where src files are kept?
[2015/10/30 07:36:30] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: src files? What do you mean by that?
[2015/10/30 07:36:56] <brmbrmcar> You know, the src folder.
[2015/10/30 07:37:25] <brmbrmcar> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/tree/master/src
[2015/10/30 07:37:25] <Karkus> for the .cpp files?
[2015/10/30 07:37:29] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/10/30 07:37:42] <Karkus> You just pasted it
[2015/10/30 07:38:17] <Karkus> They are kept on GitHub...
[2015/10/30 07:38:30] <brmbrmcar> I mean on the computer once Supertux is built.

[2015/10/30 07:45:30] <Tobbi> Hello...
[2015/10/30 07:45:35] <Tobbi> Karkus, I finished language add-ons yesterday.
[2015/10/30 07:45:44] <Tobbi> Well, partially, since you cannot disable them :D
[2015/10/30 07:45:56] <Tobbi> or rather: You need to restart supertux.
[2015/10/30 07:45:59] <Karkus> Tobbi: Great
[2015/10/30 07:45:59] <Tobbi> That needs to go.
[2015/10/30 07:46:05] <Karkus> Disable them?
[2015/10/30 07:46:26] <Tobbi> Karkus, You know: tinygettext only has an add_directory() method, not a remove_directory() one.
[2015/10/30 07:46:27] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/30 07:46:38] <Karkus> So you can't change the language mid-game?
[2015/10/30 07:46:40] <Tobbi> But that's a minor thing that needs to be address.
[2015/10/30 07:46:44] @ nerdopolis joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/30 07:46:56] <Tobbi> Karkus, No, that's not a problem: Problem is: You cannot uninstall the extra strings.
[2015/10/30 07:47:04] <Tobbi> or rather: Disable the add-on.
[2015/10/30 07:47:07] <Tobbi> It won't have any effect.
[2015/10/30 07:47:14] <Tobbi> The strings stay added to the dictionary.
[2015/10/30 07:47:26] <Tobbi> But I'll try to deal with it later today.
[2015/10/30 07:47:38] @ irungentoo joined channel #supertux

[2015/10/30 07:48:30] <Tobbi> Sure.

[2015/10/30 07:55:01] <Karkus> in which case I am even more confused.
[2015/10/30 07:55:20] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: I don't think I'm helping you.

[2015/10/30 08:53:13] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/10/30 08:54:55] <Tobbi> Actually, it's the fear that there's something living inside these mushrooms.

[2015/10/31 07:56:34] <brmbrmcar> Someone has been at my levelset overnight...
[2015/10/31 07:57:44] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: what?
[2015/10/31 07:58:18] <brmbrmcar> Three spikes have disappeared. One level has got significantly harder.
[2015/10/31 07:58:54] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Your computer is used by you only. So it was you.
[2015/10/31 08:00:11] <brmbrmcar> I am unsure about that.
[2015/10/31 08:00:40] <brmbrmcar> But, OK, I did finish it yesterday, and edit some of the files.
[2015/10/31 08:01:16] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Who else should've been it?
[2015/10/31 08:01:37] <brmbrmcar> My computer...
[2015/10/31 08:01:59] <leyyin> Tobbi, why are you talking to yourself? :/
[2015/10/31 08:02:09] <Tobbi> leyyin: what? I am not.
[2015/10/31 08:02:17] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2015/10/31 08:02:19] <leyyin> aa, nvm :P
[2015/10/31 08:02:20] <Tobbi> Maybe I am.
[2015/10/31 08:02:22] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/31 08:02:30] <brmbrmcar> leyyin has ignored me.
[2015/10/31 08:02:37] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: For good reason.
[2015/10/31 08:02:42] <leyyin> no I did not brmbrmcar
[2015/10/31 08:02:46] <Tobbi> I thought so.
[2015/10/31 08:02:48] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/10/31 08:02:49] <leyyin> I was just messing with Tobbi ;)
[2015/10/31 08:02:57] <Tobbi> As always...
[2015/10/31 08:02:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/31 08:03:07] <Tobbi> It goes without saying that he's messing with me.
[2015/10/31 08:03:20] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/10/31 08:03:31] <brmbrmcar> But I am honestly not.
[2015/10/31 08:03:48] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, how is middle school?
[2015/10/31 08:04:30] <brmbrmcar> Bad.
[2015/10/31 08:04:36] * head8debian yawns...
[2015/10/31 08:04:41] <brmbrmcar> I like the middle.
[2015/10/31 08:04:48] <head8debian> Good morning all.
[2015/10/31 08:05:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: Good morning.
[2015/10/31 08:05:25] <head8debian> Power went out and caused everything in my room to come on and wake me up. :)
[2015/10/31 08:05:27] <Tobbi> head8debian knows there's work coming up for him when I reply to his good morning :D
[2015/10/31 08:05:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: How does it work without power?
[2015/10/31 08:05:52] <leyyin> amish
[2015/10/31 08:05:56] <brmbrmcar> THe pwer came back.
[2015/10/31 08:05:57] * head8debian knows there is work coming when Tobbi is up so early...
[2015/10/31 08:06:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: 1pm?
[2015/10/31 08:06:07] <leyyin> head8debian, it's 13
[2015/10/31 08:06:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: The power came back on...
[2015/10/31 08:06:14] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/10/31 08:06:31] <head8debian> Its early for you to be in here. :-)
[2015/10/31 08:06:41] <leyyin> saturday?
[2015/10/31 08:06:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Indeed.
[2015/10/31 08:06:53] <Tobbi> saturday is the reason for me being here in the first place.

[2015/10/31 08:08:35] <leyyin> not in Romania
[2015/10/31 08:08:41] <Tobbi> Oh, okay.
[2015/10/31 08:08:44] <leyyin> 3 days of national mourning
[2015/10/31 08:09:08] <Tobbi> leyyin: Because of the fire in the night club?
[2015/10/31 08:09:17] <leyyin> yup
[2015/10/31 08:09:25] <leyyin> the biggest tragedy in over 20 years
[2015/10/31 08:09:49] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't celebrate it either. :D
[2015/10/31 08:10:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: I believe there'll be people ringing my bell...or maybe not.
[2015/10/31 08:10:06] <head8debian> Oh, today is Saturday?
[2015/10/31 08:10:12] <head8debian> Where did the week go. o_O
[2015/10/31 08:10:14] <brmbrmcar> Trick or treat?
[2015/10/31 08:10:17] <Tobbi> Maybe they got scared off by their bad opinion about me.
[2015/10/31 08:10:41] <brmbrmcar> I only give out the cheapest of sweets.
[2015/10/31 08:11:01] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Or your parents?
[2015/10/31 08:11:12] <leyyin> alol, is haloween a thing in Germany?
[2015/10/31 08:11:19] <leyyin> with candy like in the movies
[2015/10/31 08:11:22] <brmbrmcar> I am only azero.
[2015/10/31 08:11:24] <head8debian> haha.
[2015/10/31 08:11:37] <head8debian> Even cheap candy is expensive...
[2015/10/31 08:11:45] <leyyin> not in murica ;)
[2015/10/31 08:11:52] <head8debian> Here, 1 M&M for you. :p
[2015/10/31 08:12:03] <Tobbi> leyyin: It depends.
[2015/10/31 08:12:11] <Tobbi> I believe we might have gotten some kids.
[2015/10/31 08:12:15] @ Quit: brmbrmcar: 
[2015/10/31 08:12:18] <head8debian> leyyin: Uhm, 10 years ago we could buy a big bag for about 5$, now its about 20$.
[2015/10/31 08:12:19] <Tobbi> who ring my bell and dress themselves
[2015/10/31 08:12:25] <head8debian> And im not joking.
[2015/10/31 08:12:31] <leyyin> head8debian, inflation man
[2015/10/31 08:12:33] <leyyin> learn about it
[2015/10/31 08:12:42] * head8debian rolls his eyes...
[2015/10/31 08:12:47] <Tobbi> Why does brmbrmcar say "I am only a zero" all the time?
[2015/10/31 08:12:51] <head8debian> Yes its inflation!
[2015/10/31 08:12:59] <head8debian> But 20$ is rediculous!
[2015/10/31 08:13:04] <Tobbi> It's like me saying "I don't know anything about computers", except that's actually true :D
[2015/10/31 08:13:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Why do you say you know nothing about computers all the time? :D
[2015/10/31 08:13:26] <head8debian> Oh...

[2015/10/31 08:13:34] <Tobbi> See...

[2015/10/31 08:13:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: fail!
[2015/10/31 08:14:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: You cannot prove I am actually on IRC.
[2015/10/31 08:14:15] <Tobbi> You cannot prove anything.
[2015/10/31 08:14:20] <head8debian> Your talking to me, so yes i can. :D
[2015/10/31 08:14:30] <head8debian> Or you were talking to me...
[2015/10/31 08:14:41] <head8debian> Also... i have some more proof...
[2015/10/31 08:15:01] <leyyin> Tobbi, is this like the chicken or the egg problem/
[2015/10/31 08:15:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: both, yes
[2015/10/31 08:15:22] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/31 08:16:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: This proves that you must know something about computers. http://bit.ly/1GReieK :D

[2015/10/31 08:18:25] <leyyin> you will get it
[2015/10/31 08:18:36] <leyyin> head8debian, why are you giving a bit.ly link to github???
[2015/10/31 08:18:54] <head8debian> leyyin: So he doesn't know what the link will go to. : D

[2015/10/31 08:25:15] <Tobbi> We should teach brmbrmcar git properly again: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/211/commits
[2015/10/31 08:25:22] <Tobbi> For some reason, he recommitted my changes...
[2015/10/31 08:25:33] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2015/10/31 08:25:35] <Tobbi> ergo, these have a different commit SHA1 and show up in the list...
[2015/10/31 08:25:44] <Hume2> Tobbi: I have a new addon. What should I do with it?
[2015/10/31 08:25:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: Let me test it.
[2015/10/31 08:26:13] <Hume2> Well, may I push it to the addons?
[2015/10/31 08:26:19] <Hume2> And where?
[2015/10/31 08:26:33] <Tobbi> Hume2: You could push it... but I'd rather test it first.
[2015/10/31 08:26:41] <Tobbi> I believe, head8debian wants to take a look as well :P
[2015/10/31 08:27:01] <Tobbi> Hume2: addons repo is here: https://github.com/SuperTux/addons
[2015/10/31 08:27:13] <Hume2> I know.
[2015/10/31 08:27:28] <Tobbi> Actually, we should have developer add-ons.
[2015/10/31 08:27:36] <Tobbi> Things that only show up when you're in --developer mode.
[2015/10/31 08:27:58] <Hume2> I restaured some levels from fan site and put them into one worldmap.
[2015/10/31 08:29:26] <Tobbi> Hume2: But you hopefully kept the author information intact...
[2015/10/31 08:29:49] <Hume2> Tobbi: The original authors are still here.
[2015/10/31 08:29:54] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/10/31 08:30:45] <Tobbi> Hume2: Alright, push it to the add-ons repo and I will take a look...
[2015/10/31 08:31:06] <Hume2> Tobbi: Into a separate branch or dirrectly?
[2015/10/31 08:31:28] <Hume2> ...to master?
[2015/10/31 08:31:32] <Tobbi> Hume2: hmm, separate branch wouldn't work either... I believe, you better give me the ZIP.
[2015/10/31 08:31:38] <Tobbi> I will test it and then you can push it.

[2015/10/31 08:32:08] <Hume2> I don't know either how to update the repository.nfo.
[2015/10/31 08:32:16] <Tobbi> That part is not hard,
[2015/10/31 08:32:21] <leyyin> Tobbi, my thoughts exactly
[2015/10/31 08:32:54] <brmbrmcar> Don't blame me if my ping times out...

[2015/10/31 08:33:39] <brmbrmcar> I haven't.

[2015/10/31 08:36:51] <Hume2> It's in a separate branch. I'll delete the branch after it will be tested.
[2015/10/31 08:37:00] <Tobbi> Okay, let's see..
[2015/10/31 08:37:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: does the add-on work for you?
[2015/10/31 08:38:41] <Hume2> Tobbi. Yes, it does.
[2015/10/31 08:38:51] <Hume2> What's the problem?
[2015/10/31 08:38:52] <Tobbi> Hmm, it tells me the nfo file is missing an id field.
[2015/10/31 08:39:14] <Hume2> I didn't carried about that much.
[2015/10/31 08:39:26] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/10/31 08:39:26] <Hume2> Oh...
[2015/10/31 08:39:31] <Hume2> My fault.
[2015/10/31 08:39:53] <Hume2> I forgot one thing.
[2015/10/31 08:43:06] <Hume2> Tobbi: I updated it.
[2015/10/31 08:43:19] <Tobbi> leyyin: How do you interpret this: http://pastebin.com/wZ2BeGNS (line 15) is it [Voxel 1 (x, y, z, 1)][Voxel 2 (x, y, z, t)] etc.?
[2015/10/31 08:43:28] <Tobbi> ok.
[2015/10/31 08:43:59] <Tobbi> Hume2: push?
[2015/10/31 08:44:12] <Tobbi> or did you force-push?
[2015/10/31 08:44:17] <Hume2> Yes.
[2015/10/31 08:45:22] <leyyin> I do not understand the format
[2015/10/31 08:45:40] <Tobbi> leyyin: okay..np
[2015/10/31 08:45:44] <Tobbi> I will see what I can do.
[2015/10/31 08:45:44] <leyyin> should show an bit representation of the data
[2015/10/31 08:45:47] <Tobbi> Hume2: [WARNING] /Users/tobiasmarkus/workspace/supertux/src/addon/addon_manager.cpp:567 Could not load add-on info for addons/restaurator1.zip: Problem when reading addoninfo '/restaurator1.nfo': Problem when parsing addoninfo: (id ...) field missing from addon description
[2015/10/31 08:45:50] <leyyin> what is that for?
[2015/10/31 08:45:55] <Tobbi> leyyin: CAT scan images...
[2015/10/31 08:47:05] <Hume2> Tobbi: It has all field as all other addons have.
[2015/10/31 08:47:12] <Tobbi> let me check
[2015/10/31 08:49:51] <Tobbi> interesting.
[2015/10/31 08:49:53] <Tobbi> Indeed it does.
[2015/10/31 08:51:02] <Tobbi> Okay, I could load it.
[2015/10/31 09:04:53] <brmbrmcar> I catch up using the logs.
[2015/10/31 09:08:02] <brmbrmcar> I don't always follow them.
[2015/10/31 09:09:21] <brmbrmcar> Has anyone spotted the halloween changes on GitHub?

[2015/10/31 09:17:00] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/10/31 09:17:21] <Tobbi> Hume2: Okay, I believe they're good to go. :)
[2015/10/31 09:17:31] <Tobbi> Even though they still have that retro feeling about them which is good.
[2015/10/31 09:17:45] <Hume2> Thanks.
[2015/10/31 09:18:00] <Tobbi> Hume2: Can you apply that commit to the master branch and I will add the nfo file?
[2015/10/31 09:18:37] <Hume2> Yes. May I copy it to the src and worldmaps_0_4_0 too?
[2015/10/31 09:18:44] <Tobbi> Yes, please.
[2015/10/31 09:19:04] <Tobbi> Hume2: Actually, you know, the red part of the start level is rude, but we'll keep it that way for now.
[2015/10/31 09:19:09] <Tobbi> Though we should change it...
[2015/10/31 09:19:13] <Tobbi> at some point.

[2015/10/31 10:17:15] <Hume2> All tiles with ID 0 are skipped, so you can do it so.

[2015/10/31 10:21:12] <head8debian> Arg! The corner of the all "transparent" cloud tile is a diferent tile!
[2015/10/31 10:22:15] <Hume2> It's the same image, same section and even the same behaviour.

[2015/10/31 10:24:08] <Hume2> The tile 0 cannot be ever redefined, because it's skipped every time.
[2015/10/31 10:25:04] <Hume2> You can try it. Create a tile ID 0 with hurts #t. It doesn't do anything.

[2015/10/31 11:44:18] <Tobbi> because I strictly separate this from my personal life.

[2015/10/31 12:21:57] <leyyin> you should ;)
[2015/10/31 12:26:50] <Hume2> Is there anyone fancy in restauring levels on the old fan site?
[2015/10/31 12:28:39] <brmbrmcar> How do you do it?
[2015/10/31 12:32:19] <mt> download them, convert them to 0.3+ levels and change them to make use of new tiles, features (scripts, new objects) and maybe add billboards
[2015/10/31 12:32:40] <Hume2> Exactly, brmbrmcar.
[2015/10/31 12:33:11] <Hume2> I have already all levels converted to milestone 2 format, so you could just pick the level and edit it.
[2015/10/31 12:33:40] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/10/31 12:33:41] <mt> oh and forget about all the bad levels (or fix them)
[2015/10/31 12:33:49] <brmbrmcar> Where are they?
[2015/10/31 12:34:28] <Hume2> Empty bonus blocks, brown blocks, coin boxes and all those crappy blocks used instead of ground ... just replace it by ice!
[2015/10/31 12:35:06] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Nowhere. I'll upload it to the addon repository into a separate branch.
[2015/10/31 12:35:29] <Hume2> You access it the same as SuperTux repositoy, it has just another address.
[2015/10/31 12:35:31] <mt> Hume2 could probably upload them to a new repo in the SuperTux organization, create a level-designers team and add brmbrmcar to that and then give that team access to the repo
[2015/10/31 12:36:21] <Hume2> mt: It
[2015/10/31 12:36:30] <Hume2> It's a good idea.
[2015/10/31 12:36:45] <mt> the src/ dir in the addons repo seems more like a bad idea
[2015/10/31 12:37:12] <brmbrmcar> That would be good.
[2015/10/31 12:37:25] <mt> I'd suggest that to keep only old addons and require authors of new addons (when we require github accounts) to keep their addons in a special repo
[2015/10/31 12:37:32] <mt> s/that//
[2015/10/31 12:37:32] <red_bot> mt meant: "I'd suggest  to keep only old addons and require authors of new addons (when we require github accounts) to keep their addons in a special repo"
[2015/10/31 12:37:50] <Tobbi> one space too much.
[2015/10/31 12:38:06] <Hume2> mt: I think that this repo should be only for WIP worlds.
[2015/10/31 12:38:36] <mt> well I mean: create a separate repo for all worlds
[2015/10/31 12:38:54] <mt> if the add-on is official, create the repo in the SuperTux org
[2015/10/31 12:39:09] <mt> if the add-on is unofficial, create the repo in your own account
[2015/10/31 12:39:46] <Hume2> mt: I'm not sure that I got it well.
[2015/10/31 12:40:10] <brmbrmcar> mt: I disagree.
[2015/10/31 12:40:21] <Hume2> mt: Do you mean adding a fork?
[2015/10/31 12:40:43] <mt> forking? I didn't talk about forking
[2015/10/31 12:41:01] <mt> I just meant every add-on gets its own repo and is developed in there
[2015/10/31 12:41:22] <brmbrmcar> If you make it too complex, noone will make addons.
[2015/10/31 12:41:26] <Hume2> mt: So you mean adding a temporary repo for each addon. Right?
[2015/10/31 12:41:35] <mt> temporary?
[2015/10/31 12:41:56] <mt> more like, actually permanent so you can still change things in the future

[2015/10/31 12:43:30] <head8debian> Yep. :D
[2015/10/31 12:43:31] <mt> brmbrmcar: well, for now we could do so at least for official add-ons
[2015/10/31 12:43:32] <leyyin> head8debian, why man?
[2015/10/31 12:43:50] <head8debian> I mean i don't sit and watch random things... i use it when i need it.
[2015/10/31 12:44:00] <Hume2> mt: I don't tkink that we need it too complex. I just want a branch on that I can work together with brmbrmcar.
[2015/10/31 12:44:03] <head8debian> We don't even have a TV. :D
[2015/10/31 12:44:08] <jesusalva> I'm going for lunch, see you soon.

[2015/10/31 12:44:16] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/10/31 12:44:17] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/31 12:44:25] <leyyin> head8debian, me neither, TV is dead
[2015/10/31 12:44:26] <jesusalva_> It's 14:42 here
[2015/10/31 12:44:30] <Tobbi> :D okay...
[2015/10/31 12:44:34] <jesusalva_> Meaning I'm 2 hours and half late. :D
[2015/10/31 12:44:37] <head8debian> No its not...
[2015/10/31 12:44:39] <mt> Hume2: that'd require adding brmbrmcar to at least the addons repo
[2015/10/31 12:44:43] <head8debian> I would liek a projector.
[2015/10/31 12:45:01] <mt> and really, keeping things separate is always a good idea
[2015/10/31 12:45:01] <Tobbi> I want a girlfriend.
[2015/10/31 12:45:03] <Hume2> mt: I can give him access to my fork.
[2015/10/31 12:45:05] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/31 12:48:37] <mt> What I'd like to see is at least a separation between the addons repo with the .zips and the source files of the addons
[2015/10/31 12:49:00] <mt> Because it will actually make working on an addon easier, not harder
[2015/10/31 12:49:38] <mt> question: do add-ons have version numbers?
[2015/10/31 12:50:08] <Hume2> mt: Yes, they have.
[2015/10/31 12:53:49] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I did it.
[2015/10/31 12:54:18] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Clone the addon repository.
[2015/10/31 12:54:32] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/10/31 12:54:59] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: My fork is on https://github.com/Hume2/addons.git
[2015/10/31 12:55:26] <Hume2> I added you to colaborators, so you should be able to push there your stuff.
[2015/10/31 12:55:31] <mt> uh, what's the difference between Levels/ Worldmaps*/ and repository/?
[2015/10/31 12:55:54] <Hume2> mt: It works, so why do you complain?
[2015/10/31 12:56:08] <brmbrmcar> Done.
[2015/10/31 12:56:16] <mt> Because I'm currently trying to actually understand the repo system
[2015/10/31 12:56:37] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You should see a directory src/restaurator2.
[2015/10/31 12:56:44] <mt> And that said, git doesn't handle binary files very well, duplicate files are not that good
[2015/10/31 12:56:54] <Hume2> mt: I created a new fork.
[2015/10/31 12:57:00] <mt> So I'm trying to find out if these files are duplicates or not
[2015/10/31 12:57:18] <mt> You realize I'm talking about the folders in the addon repo?
[2015/10/31 12:57:23] <mt> Not about any fork
[2015/10/31 12:57:59] <Hume2> mt: Got your problem. They are duplicate AFAIK.

[2015/10/31 13:00:50] <brmbrmcar> I am on there now.

[2015/10/31 13:01:29] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Don't care about the snowy background yet. I have a paralax background generator.
[2015/10/31 13:03:21] <Hume2> And one more thing: Have you already started? If so, then finish it and start from the other end. I don't want any conflicts.
[2015/10/31 13:07:33] <mt> what do you think of https://gist.github.com/maxteufel/5b7d4cde4267537a7894 for the addon repository
[2015/10/31 13:08:16] <mt> Hume2: btw, in the first level of restaurator1, please try to reduce the number of info blocks.
[2015/10/31 13:08:51] <Hume2> mt: That's what's the level about :P
[2015/10/31 13:09:28] <mt> yet it's too much info blocks
[2015/10/31 13:09:39] <mt> can't you make an introductory scrolling text
[2015/10/31 13:09:52] <mt> like at the end of world1?
[2015/10/31 13:12:43] <Hume2> mt: I'm tired.
[2015/10/31 13:13:11] <mt> you don't have to do that immediately
[2015/10/31 13:25:26] <brmbrmcar> What command should I run to clone the right branch?
[2015/10/31 13:25:53] <brmbrmcar> I did it wrong earlier.

[2015/10/31 14:50:12] <Karkus> When did you watch it muted?
[2015/10/31 14:50:26] <Tobbi> A few days back.
[2015/10/31 14:50:33] <Tobbi> eeh years
[2015/10/31 14:50:35] <Tobbi> Not days.
[2015/10/31 14:51:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, do you know where I can find a tutorial on how PhysFS works? I'm searching and I've found nothing.
[2015/10/31 14:51:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: What exactly do you need to know? https://icculus.org/physfs/ There's an API...
[2015/10/31 14:52:04] <Tobbi> And something that explains the methods.
[2015/10/31 14:53:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: Which API? There appears to be a few...
[2015/10/31 14:53:53] <Tobbi> Karkus: what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[2015/10/31 14:54:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: I am trying to parse an s-expr file without running the actual game code.
[2015/10/31 14:54:51] <Tobbi> And you need PhysFS for that? It's only a filesystem...
[2015/10/31 14:56:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, I created a new main function and ran "parser.parse(<file path e.g. /home/username/test>)" but it gave me a segmentation fault.
[2015/10/31 14:56:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: best thing would be to run it through a debugger...Do you know how to do it?
[2015/10/31 14:57:00] <red_bot> O_O
[2015/10/31 14:57:01] <Karkus> Debugging led me to PHYSFS_openRead https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/src/physfs/ifile_streambuf.cpp#L33
[2015/10/31 14:57:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: and the file exists, for sure?
[2015/10/31 14:57:28] <Tobbi> Wait!
[2015/10/31 14:57:31] <Karkus> On my filesystem, yes
[2015/10/31 14:57:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: You need to add the directory to the search path.
[2015/10/31 14:57:49] <Tobbi> And then it can open relative paths inside the search oath.
[2015/10/31 14:57:50] <Tobbi> path
[2015/10/31 14:57:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: Right.
[2015/10/31 14:58:13] <Karkus> this is why I wanted a phyfs tutorial
[2015/10/31 14:58:45] <Karkus> Okay, let me look in the api. Which API do we use?
[2015/10/31 14:59:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: Uh, good question...
[2015/10/31 15:00:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: just take a look at https://icculus.org/physfs/docs/html/annotated.html

[2015/10/31 17:02:55] * jesusalva don't use GDB a long time ago...
[2015/10/31 17:02:58] <Tobbi> jesusalva: huh?
[2015/10/31 17:03:05] <jesusalva> To quit
[2015/10/31 17:03:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: You don't, apparently
[2015/10/31 17:03:12] <Tobbi> I often just type Quit :D
[2015/10/31 17:03:17] <jesusalva> Oh. :)
[2015/10/31 17:03:28] <Tobbi> Karkus: What don't I?
[2015/10/31 17:03:38] <Karkus> need sudo
[2015/10/31 17:03:42] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/10/31 17:04:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: after it crashed, type bt --full
[2015/10/31 17:04:15] <Karkus> you as in 'one does not need sudo'
[2015/10/31 17:04:20] <Tobbi> That should give you a backtrace.
[2015/10/31 17:05:06] <Karkus> bt works, but bt --full gives -> No symbol "full" in current context7
[2015/10/31 17:05:29] <Tobbi> okay.
[2015/10/31 17:05:34] <Tobbi> What does bt show you?
[2015/10/31 17:05:41] <Tobbi> Does it show you source addresses?
[2015/10/31 17:05:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: Lot's of stuff. Yup
[2015/10/31 17:05:55] <Tobbi> aka line number.
[2015/10/31 17:05:55] <Tobbi> s
[2015/10/31 17:05:57] <Tobbi> okay.
[2015/10/31 17:06:23] <Karkus> This will be useful :)

[2015/10/31 17:58:46] <jesusalva> Didn't you meant "Assault"? ^
[2015/10/31 18:01:56] <brmbrmcar> Probably.
[2015/10/31 18:06:09] <Tobbi> jesusalva: Yes, but I believe this needs to be fixed somewhere...
[2015/10/31 18:06:11] <Tobbi> In the files etc.
[2015/10/31 18:06:40] <jesusalva> No idea where. That location above is what I got from Transifex.
[2015/10/31 18:15:26] <brmbrmcar> On the level itself?
[2015/10/31 18:16:37] <jesusalva> On Transifex.
[2015/10/31 18:16:46] <jesusalva> The translations plataform.
[2015/10/31 18:17:22] <Tobbi> jesusalva: I believe this needs to be changed in the source files of the add-on, then the localization files recreated etc.
[2015/10/31 18:17:54] <jesusalva> I know, you change the source file and the rest comes in automatic. (or rather, giby does it)
[2015/10/31 18:18:26] <jesusalva> I just think that the "*NEW*" Would be better if new levels were written in red.

[2015/10/31 18:38:41] <Tobbi> actually, not sure.
[2015/10/31 18:38:47] <Tobbi> But something needs to be done.
[2015/10/31 18:40:00] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/31 18:40:25] <jesusalva> I think that adding text (CAPITALIZED or not) will not solve the problem. But some 4new color or new effect might call more attention, if you understand me. Letters aren't important when their size is too big.
[2015/10/31 18:40:27] @ Quit: Karkus: Changing host
[2015/10/31 18:40:27] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/10/31 18:40:54] <Karkus> jesusalva: How'd you do colours!
[2015/10/31 18:41:00] <jesusalva> Hi Karkus.
[2015/10/31 18:41:09] <Karkus> Hi jesusalva
[2015/10/31 18:41:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: Adding colours is not the problem, I believe, you'd need to change this in the code.
[2015/10/31 18:42:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Err... on the IRC?
[2015/10/31 18:42:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, I believe we're talking about the addon manager.
[2015/10/31 18:43:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh.
[2015/10/31 18:43:42] <Karkus> I mean how'd you make coloured text in the IRC, jesusalva?
[2015/10/31 18:43:58] <jesusalva> Depends on client.
[2015/10/31 18:44:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Coloured text shouldn't be too hard... when it goes through our translation we can pick up colour codes, and add them in- maybe...
[2015/10/31 18:44:30] <jesusalva> On my KVIrc it's just pressing 'Ctrl+K'. It's often reffered as "mIrc code" on some help guides.
[2015/10/31 18:44:54] <Karkus> Well, it appears on hexchat, but it's not ctrl-k
[2015/10/31 18:45:04] <Karkus>  <- ctrl k
[2015/10/31 18:45:11] <Karkus> Ignore that
[2015/10/31 18:46:58] <Karkus> 11blah die blah
[2015/10/31 18:47:04] <Karkus> Hey, it worked
[2015/10/31 18:47:25] <Tobbi> Unfortunately, my LimeChat doesn't show it.
[2015/10/31 18:47:29] <Tobbi> But I'm glad it doesn't.
[2015/10/31 18:48:19] <Karkus> Karkus: 13test
[2015/10/31 18:48:22] <o11c> ^C is the actual letter, ^K is just the shortcut
[2015/10/31 18:48:25] <Karkus> Karkus: test
[2015/10/31 18:48:32] <o11c> also there's ^B and several others
[2015/10/31 18:48:48] <jesusalva> Well, at least there isn't anyone who uses colors madly. I think that's why giby removed the +c status (no control code)
[2015/10/31 18:49:00] <Karkus> jesusalva: What colour is 12,1this?
[2015/10/31 18:49:07] <jesusalva> o11c: I know, I use ^B to colors, ^R to reverse, etc.
[2015/10/31 18:49:11] <jesusalva> Karkus: Blue.
[2015/10/31 18:49:23] <Karkus> jesusalva: any background colour?
[2015/10/31 18:49:31] <jesusalva> No, for that you use reverse.
[2015/10/31 18:49:31] <o11c> dark gray
[2015/10/31 18:49:38] <jesusalva> 9Like this
[2015/10/31 18:50:01] <Karkus> jesusalva: You couldn't see the background?
[2015/10/31 18:50:04] <o11c> 03,04you can do both
[2015/10/31 18:50:16] <jesusalva> Karkus: If it was black, then no.
[2015/10/31 18:50:21] <jesusalva> My screen is black. =)
[2015/10/31 18:50:22] <Karkus> dammit
[2015/10/31 18:50:34] <o11c> Karkus: worked for me

[2015/10/31 18:50:50] <Karkus> o11c: You're wrong it's white and gold
[2015/10/31 18:51:26] <Karkus> *everyone laughs*
[2015/10/31 18:51:56] * o11c ignores it and hopes it goes away
[2015/10/31 18:52:05] <Tobbi> This doesn't look any different. It shows italic, but nothing more.
[2015/10/31 18:52:08] <Tobbi> And I'm glad it does.
[2015/10/31 18:52:23] <Karkus> o11c: The dress?
[2015/10/31 18:53:01] <Karkus> Who knows what I meant when I said it wasn't black and blue it was white and gold?
[2015/10/31 18:53:27] <alket> 04this is cool
[2015/10/31 18:54:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: You recognise this right -> http://www.jurkjes.nl/nieuws/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/the_dress.jpg
[2015/10/31 18:54:51] <Tobbi> of course I do.
[2015/10/31 18:54:52] <jesusalva> I rember a silly picture which... oh.
[2015/10/31 18:54:55] <Tobbi> I actually have no idea.
[2015/10/31 18:55:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: You do recognise it then?
[2015/10/31 18:55:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't.
[2015/10/31 18:55:27] <Tobbi> What're you getting at?
[2015/10/31 18:55:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: What colour is the dress?
[2015/10/31 18:56:49] <Tobbi> gold white.
[2015/10/31 18:57:08] <jesusalva> Lol
[2015/10/31 18:57:15] <Karkus> Nope. I see it as blue and black.
[2015/10/31 18:57:19] <Karkus> jesusalva: ?
[2015/10/31 18:57:23] <alket> lol
[2015/10/31 18:57:25] <Karkus> What about you?
[2015/10/31 18:57:28] <alket> its blue, check gimp
[2015/10/31 18:57:43] <Tobbi> uh?
[2015/10/31 18:57:58] <alket> Tobbi: select the dress color in gimp and you will see
[2015/10/31 18:58:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: Did this picture never reach you in Germany
[2015/10/31 18:58:03] <Tobbi> Okay, okay.
[2015/10/31 18:58:14] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2015/10/31 18:58:21] <alket> it was a big ype some months ago
[2015/10/31 18:58:35] <alket> *hype
[2015/10/31 18:58:36] <Karkus> alket: last year, iirc
[2015/10/31 18:59:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: Basically, half the people think it's white gold, half think it's blue black.
[2015/10/31 18:59:12] <alket> I really don't get it why some people see it white
[2015/10/31 18:59:19] <Karkus> alket: +1
[2015/10/31 19:00:08] <Tobbi> Maybe it has something to do with how we perceive stuff..
[2015/10/31 19:00:38] <alket> yep
[2015/10/31 19:02:39] <alket> some couples got divorced because of this lol
[2015/10/31 19:02:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's just an interesting phenomenon
[2015/10/31 19:03:08] <Karkus> But it basically divided the internet into two halves.
[2015/10/31 19:03:56] <alket> yeah I'm glad I was right :p
[2015/10/31 19:04:25] <Tobbi> "D
[2015/10/31 19:04:28] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/31 19:04:41] <jesusalva> I saw it white and gold... but who cares, those are my favourite colors anyway. =D
[2015/10/31 19:09:50] <Karkus> AH FUCK
[2015/10/31 19:10:03] <Karkus> THAT SPIDER IS AS BIG AS MY HAND!
[2015/10/31 19:10:28] <Karkus> sorry
[2015/10/31 19:10:44] <Karkus> don't mind me...
[2015/10/31 19:16:59] <Karkus> You see Mushrooms arent as scary as spiders, because they dont move. They can be scary, but pose no real threat.
[2015/10/31 19:23:48] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/31 19:23:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am not afraid of spiders at all.
[2015/10/31 19:23:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/31 19:24:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hey, I saw it go under a book. If I ever need that book again, I'll have to buy it.
[2015/10/31 19:25:24] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/31 19:25:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know a lot of people who are afraid of spiders...
[2015/10/31 19:25:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: No kidding, there's another one.
[2015/10/31 19:26:32] <Karkus> I think they're breeding behind my wardrobe.
[2015/10/31 19:26:43] <Karkus> And now it's under my bed. Great.
[2015/10/31 19:27:12] <Tobbi> Karkus: Do you know the movie "The Mummy"
[2015/10/31 19:27:14] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/10/31 19:27:34] <Karkus> Tobbi: I haven't watched it.
[2015/10/31 19:28:02] <Tobbi> Karkus: I was at a friends birthday party when I was 12 or so. And he watched it...I got scared to death because there were these scarabeus bugs...
[2015/10/31 19:30:11] <Karkus> Sorry, gtg.
[2015/10/31 19:30:12] @ Quit: Karkus: Quit: Leaving
[2015/10/31 19:33:00] <jesusalva> Tobbi: And I finally terminated the "/brmbrmcar" command. =)
[2015/10/31 19:38:17] <Tobbi> jesusalva: Which command?
[2015/10/31 19:40:12] <jesusalva> A custom one.
[2015/10/31 19:40:38] <jesusalva> You can create new commands for IRC, did you knew? I just did one. Needless to say that it only works on my computer. :)
[2015/10/31 19:45:02] <Tobbi> jesusalva: What did that /brmbrmcar command do?
[2015/10/31 19:45:45] <jesusalva> I'll put it to run, wait a little...
[2015/10/31 19:45:58] <jesusalva> What?
[2015/10/31 19:46:15] <jesusalva> Tobbi Baa.
[2015/10/31 19:46:20] <jesusalva> Tobbi Baa.
[2015/10/31 19:46:25] <jesusalva> Tobbi Baa.
[2015/10/31 19:46:26] <Tobbi> jesusalva: I don't get it.
[2015/10/31 19:46:28] <Tobbi> Okay, okay.
[2015/10/31 19:46:32] <jesusalva> =)
[2015/10/31 19:46:39] <Tobbi> Why would anyone want a command that outputs Baa
[2015/10/31 19:47:00] <jesusalva> It speaks forever "%s Baa" every X seconds.
[2015/10/31 19:47:10] <jesusalva> That's why we have a command to stop it.
[2015/10/31 19:47:46] <jesusalva> Tobbi: Exactly, don't you see brmbrmcar on this command?
[2015/10/31 19:47:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/10/31 19:56:34] <Tobbi> jesusalva: So, wait a second: These commands are valid for everyone here?
[2015/10/31 20:01:51] <jesusalva> Hm. I think I failed the part of saying a different nickname, you must change it manually, but you can customize time.
[2015/10/31 20:02:05] <jesusalva> Something like
[2015/10/31 20:02:12] <jesusalva> Tobbi Baa.
[2015/10/31 20:02:14] <jesusalva> Tobbi Baa.
[2015/10/31 20:02:16] <jesusalva> Tobbi Baa.
[2015/10/31 20:02:39] <jesusalva> Each 2 seconds. But I can use every 5 as above. And every 10. Every 20. Every hour, even.
[2015/10/31 20:04:00] <jesusalva> ...Even every half second. That's too spammy to post here, after all, everyone can see the effect.
[2015/10/31 20:04:34] <jesusalva> I'm just trying to use /say without suppling a window id. :/
[2015/10/31 20:10:09] <Tobbi> uhm, ok
[2015/10/31 20:11:11] <jesusalva> Sorry. You wanted to say with someone else?
[2015/10/31 20:11:27] <jesusalva> It's possible, but it's, ehh, "hardcoded" they say...
[2015/10/31 20:12:11] <jesusalva> The syntax is /brmbrmcar <delay>, and not /brmbrmcar <nick> <delay>... :(
[2015/10/31 20:13:30] <Tobbi> I see.
[2015/10/31 20:13:33] <Tobbi> doesn't matter.

[2015/11/01 04:57:39] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/01 05:00:38] <mt> btw this: http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/File:Howtonotdesignlevels.jpg and http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/File:Hallofshame.jpg
[2015/11/01 05:00:51] <mt> make sure to follow these when fixing the levels
[2015/11/01 05:01:21] <Hume2> mt: At least I follow them.
[2015/11/01 05:01:31] <mt> and if that's too much work to do, think about removing the level in its entirety
[2015/11/01 05:01:41] <brmbrmcar> I forgot to resize, but I fixed that.
[2015/11/01 05:01:55] <mt> Hume2: I haven't seen the progress in the restaurator branch, sadly
[2015/11/01 05:02:18] <mt> But I'm also talking about restaurator1
[2015/11/01 05:02:54] <Hume2> mt: I don't want to update whole addon just because one request.
[2015/11/01 05:03:12] <Hume2> I'll update it after more changes will be to do.
[2015/11/01 05:03:23] <mt> I know.
[2015/11/01 05:03:30] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: What did you changed in andrews_island_level1.stl?
[2015/11/01 05:03:39] <mt> I haven't asked you to do so
[2015/11/01 05:04:01] <Hume2> mt: It's in hume2/restaurator.
[2015/11/01 05:13:03] <brmbrmcar> I replaced some powerups, removed some silly foreground tiles over real ones and made the end possible.

[2015/11/01 07:22:47] <Tobbi> Yes. But the sprite...well...
[2015/11/01 07:22:56] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/11/01 07:23:03] <Karkus> Hmmm... indeed.
[2015/11/01 07:23:14] <Tobbi> Unfortunately, leaves are the equivalent to snowballs in the forest world.
[2015/11/01 07:23:26] <Tobbi> But we cannot have leafs with spikes.

[2015/11/01 07:29:04] <Karkus> *sigh* :(
[2015/11/01 07:29:35] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/11/01 07:29:59] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It looks like the level is damaged. It looks like you frogot a brace.
[2015/11/01 07:30:46] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/01 07:31:00] <brmbrmcar> I will try to fix.
[2015/11/01 07:31:08] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Look at line 95.
[2015/11/01 07:32:52] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: And while you are at it, look at src/restaurator2/guide.txt
[2015/11/01 07:35:48] <brmbrmcar> It doesn't want to be resized.
[2015/11/01 07:36:16] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Do you use the editor for mono?
[2015/11/01 07:36:27] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/01 07:36:33] <brmbrmcar> What do you mean?
[2015/11/01 07:36:56] <Hume2> Well, what editor do you use?
[2015/11/01 07:37:54] <brmbrmcar> For what?
[2015/11/01 07:38:31] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: The supertux level editor. Do you use any?
[2015/11/01 07:38:53] <brmbrmcar> I got it from ppa:supertux-dev/daily.
[2015/11/01 07:39:35] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Is it the editor that has a left sidebar with icons?
[2015/11/01 07:39:40] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/01 07:39:54] <Hume2> So that's the mono SuperTux editor.
[2015/11/01 07:40:19] <Hume2> So you right-clicked on the sector main and typed resize. Right?
[2015/11/01 07:41:15] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/01 07:41:17] <brmbrmcar> http://oi63.tinypic.com/a3mohw.jpg
[2015/11/01 07:41:57] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: So type 11 into y-offset and 36 into height. The other fields let as the are.
[2015/11/01 07:43:38] <brmbrmcar> Yay!
[2015/11/01 07:44:23] <brmbrmcar> Wait, all objects are below. How do you move them?
[2015/11/01 07:45:28] <brmbrmcar> I moved them, but it caused bugs.
[2015/11/01 07:45:48] <Hume2> Agreed. Flying snowballs and flames are buggy.
[2015/11/01 07:46:15] <brmbrmcar> Not that...
[2015/11/01 07:46:24] <brmbrmcar> Although I do agree.
[2015/11/01 07:46:29] <Hume2> I move them per smaller counts.
[2015/11/01 07:48:13] <brmbrmcar> I'll take a snapshot.
[2015/11/01 07:48:28] <brmbrmcar> THe tilemap is bugged since the resize.
[2015/11/01 07:50:33] <brmbrmcar> http://oi65.tinypic.com/2nsw3o0.jpg
[2015/11/01 07:51:20] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It's because you resized only one tilemap. When you right-click on the sector name, you can resize whole sector at once.
[2015/11/01 07:51:50] <Hume2> You know, the "main" thing.
[2015/11/01 07:52:04] <brmbrmcar> THat is what I did.
[2015/11/01 07:52:22] <Hume2> hmmm...
[2015/11/01 07:52:43] <Hume2> Does the tilemap(200) still exist?
[2015/11/01 07:52:49] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/01 07:54:12] <brmbrmcar> Something terrible has happened...
[2015/11/01 07:54:26] <brmbrmcar> Why don't I just restart it?
[2015/11/01 07:54:43] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: First of all, I see the sector is still only 15 blocks high.
[2015/11/01 07:55:06] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: No need for restart.
[2015/11/01 07:55:10] <brmbrmcar> I didn't push those changes, because they were buggy.
[2015/11/01 07:55:52] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Now you can push it here, because it doesn
[2015/11/01 07:56:03] <Hume2> ...doesn't affect other levels.
[2015/11/01 07:58:30] <brmbrmcar> I did it.
[2015/11/01 07:58:37] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It goes well. There are invisible blocks instead of terrain.
[2015/11/01 07:58:55] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You should substitute them by normal terrain anyway.
[2015/11/01 07:59:02] <brmbrmcar> It was different when I first changed it.
[2015/11/01 07:59:06] <brmbrmcar> Iwill fix.
[2015/11/01 07:59:38] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: And for the secret area, do you know how to make a secret area with fade-tilemap?
[2015/11/01 08:00:32] <brmbrmcar> No, but if you told me the scipt...
[2015/11/01 08:00:50] <brmbrmcar> s/scipt/script/
[2015/11/01 08:00:50] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "No, but if you told me the script..."
[2015/11/01 08:02:43] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You don't need any script. You just put there the secretarea trigger and fill the tilemap's name into the "fade-tilemap" fiels.
[2015/11/01 08:02:51] <Hume2> s/fiels/field/
[2015/11/01 08:02:51] <red_bot> Hume2 meant: "brmbrmcar: You don't need any script. You just put there the secretarea trigger and fill the tilemap's name into the "fade-tilemap" field."
[2015/11/01 08:04:29] <Tobbi> I need someone to tell me I
[2015/11/01 08:04:32] <Tobbi> m a loser.
[2015/11/01 08:04:33] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/01 08:07:09] <brmbrmcar> I wrote in Tilemap (200) and it isn't fading.
[2015/11/01 08:07:38] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You have to rename the tilemap to something else.
[2015/11/01 08:08:13] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: left click the tilemap and fill "secret" into the "name" field.
[2015/11/01 08:08:36] <Hume2> After that fill in "secter" to the "fade-tilemap" field of the secret area.
[2015/11/01 08:08:47] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: It worked!
[2015/11/01 08:09:21] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Anyway, do you know how to add a tilemap?
[2015/11/01 08:09:26] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/01 08:09:40] <brmbrmcar> Although I have never done it.

[2015/11/01 08:34:08] <brmbrmcar> Why does my ping keep timing out?
[2015/11/01 08:36:47] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: i  don't know. It's usually caused by weak internet connection.
[2015/11/01 08:39:09] <brmbrmcar> I have bad internet.
[2015/11/01 08:39:27] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: That would be why.
[2015/11/01 08:39:43] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Also, you might want to try a better IRC client.
[2015/11/01 08:39:55] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Give KiwiIRC a try. look it up.

[2015/11/01 08:41:19] <brmbrmcar> How do I use my cloak?
[2015/11/01 08:42:21] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: You have to verify your nickname with freenode every time you log in, if you are registered.
[2015/11/01 08:42:33] <brmbrmcar> I have done that.
[2015/11/01 08:43:18] <brmbrmcar> Now what?
[2015/11/01 08:47:22] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: you have to verify with the *when* you log into IRC.
[2015/11/01 08:47:32] <brmbrmcar> I did that.
[2015/11/01 08:47:53] <head8debian> Well aparently not, because i still see your IP address. :D
[2015/11/01 08:48:03] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Did anyone give you a cloak in #freenode?
[2015/11/01 08:48:08] <brmbrmcar> What command do I run?
[2015/11/01 08:48:20] <brmbrmcar> I have a cloak.
[2015/11/01 08:49:12] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: If they gave you a cloak and you verified with services when you logged into IRC, the cloak should be applied automatically...
[2015/11/01 08:49:30] <brmbrmcar> [NickServ]
[2015/11/01 08:49:30] <brmbrmcar> You are already logged in as brmbrmcar.
[2015/11/01 08:54:00] <brmbrmcar> I was told it wouldn't work on kiwiirc.
[2015/11/01 08:54:06] <brmbrmcar> Do you use it?
[2015/11/01 08:54:34] <head8debian>  brmbrmcar If i have to i do.

[2015/11/01 08:55:32] <brmbrmcar> I am trying to get that.
[2015/11/01 08:55:54] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Go here, and click on "i have a password" and enter your freenode password then click connect. https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net
[2015/11/01 08:56:09] <brmbrmcar> I have done that.

[2015/11/01 08:57:51] <mt> head8debian: yeah, but unaffiliated cloaks generally won't work on webirc or any other gateway
[2015/11/01 08:58:01] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Well then, you may need a "propper" irc client... try hexchat or pidgeon
[2015/11/01 08:58:25] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux

[2015/11/01 08:58:42] <mt> please don't recommend that
[2015/11/01 08:58:54] <mt> its irc implementation is broken
[2015/11/01 08:58:57] <brmbrmcar> My cloak is not showing.
[2015/11/01 08:59:08] <brmbrmcar> I am on irssi.
[2015/11/01 08:59:24] <mt> did you ask for a cloak?
[2015/11/01 08:59:40] <mt> because you actually don't have one

[2015/11/01 09:00:46] <mt> also:
[2015/11/01 09:00:54] <mt> brmbrmcar: cloaks don't hide your IP very well, see https://gist.github.com/maxteufel/1e2cf7ada079c271bd3c for more detailed information
[2015/11/01 09:01:25] <mt> (just for your information ^)
[2015/11/01 09:01:37] <head8debian> But pidgin does the job when needed...
[2015/11/01 09:02:26] <mt> heck, gnutls-cli is more user-friendly than pidgin
[2015/11/01 09:03:39] <mt> (or don't recommend something just because it 'does the job when needed', hexchat is better and installing is as easy as installing pidgin)

[2015/11/01 09:27:31] <brmbrmcar> Karkus asked if he looked big in his cloak.
[2015/11/01 09:28:10] <mt> well, for me, "15:24:17 --> brmbrmcar [brmbrmcar] (Unknown) (~brmbrmcar@unaffiliated/brmbrmcar) has joined #supertux" is smaller than "14:39:03 --> brmbrmcar [brmbrmcar] ([www.kiwiirc.com] brmbrmcar) (d57afd07@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.213.122.253.7) has joined #supertux" :P
[2015/11/01 09:28:44] <brmbrmcar> That was earlier.
[2015/11/01 09:29:01] <brmbrmcar> Have the logs been fixed?
[2015/11/01 09:29:16] <mt> dunno
[2015/11/01 09:29:25] <mt> looks like the server has been shut down
[2015/11/01 09:30:18] <brmbrmcar> Are there any other logs for this channel?
[2015/11/01 09:30:19] <mt> because I'd have noticed a bigger amazon outage in ashburn
[2015/11/01 09:31:14] <mt> well, I store logs
[2015/11/01 09:32:16] <brmbrmcar> On your computer?
[2015/11/01 09:32:24] <mt> on my server
[2015/11/01 09:32:38] <brmbrmcar> Where is your server?
[2015/11/01 09:33:29] <mt> its physical location is London, UK
[2015/11/01 09:33:40] <mt> more exactly the telecity facility
[2015/11/01 09:34:08] <brmbrmcar> So I have to drive there and hack a computer to get the logs?
[2015/11/01 09:34:14] <brmbrmcar> London is massive!
[2015/11/01 09:34:34] <brmbrmcar> Where in London?

[2015/11/01 09:39:03] <brmbrmcar> https://web.archive.org/web/*/stux.logular.com
[2015/11/01 09:39:57] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Use HexChat. Irssi is for people who are too full of themselves to get a GUI.
[2015/11/01 09:40:23] <Karkus> head8debian: No offense, of course
[2015/11/01 09:40:32] <Karkus> :P
[2015/11/01 09:40:35] <brmbrmcar> Irssi just seems awesome.
[2015/11/01 09:40:59] <brmbrmcar> I like the Konsole better than any other application.
[2015/11/01 09:41:01] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: vi seems awsome, but I still use codelite for c++...
[2015/11/01 09:41:13] <brmbrmcar> https://web.archive.org/web/20070113195316/http://supertux.lethargik.org/
[2015/11/01 09:41:25] <Karkus> gdb is great, but I don't use that from the terminal either...
[2015/11/01 09:42:54] <Karkus> I don't like applications which swallow the terminal. It means I have to open another one for commands, and then I always click the wrong one.
[2015/11/01 09:44:28] <brmbrmcar> But I don't mind.
[2015/11/01 09:46:04] <head8debian> I have logs if you need them...
[2015/11/01 09:46:13] <head8debian> jeezy: is the owner to the log bot.
[2015/11/01 09:57:20] <Karkus> head8debian: I'm thinking we should have a contacts page, which would direct people towards the people who host the servers etc. in case we forget. Here's my draft on my fork: https://github.com/Karkus476/supertux/wiki/Whom-Should-I-Contact%3F
[2015/11/01 10:00:36] <Not-6fa5> [02supertux] 07DevynCJohnson commented on issue 03#190: Improved ghosttree sprite - 13http://git.io/vl8kF
[2015/11/01 10:02:06] <Karkus> Is Devyn C Johnson here on the irc?
[2015/11/01 10:03:29] <mt> Karkus: hm. 1) remove the quote from emergency. emergency is a normal word in noc language 2) it should be 'visit our Contacts page'
[2015/11/01 10:04:30] <mt> 3) 'a problem concerning copyright or other legal business' github handles DMCA themselves (https://github.com/github/dmca)
[2015/11/01 10:04:32] <Tobbi> No, he's not on IRC.
[2015/11/01 10:05:15] <Karkus> 2) Okay 1) Okay, but maybe emergency isn't the right word
[2015/11/01 10:06:51] <mt> 4) 'supertux.github.io' is also hosted on GitHub, so... if you can reach the github-wiki you should also be able to reach *.github.io or at least see the "Status" link on the bottom of the page
[2015/11/01 10:06:53] <Karkus> 3) Right, but not all copyright issues necessarily concern GitHub.
[2015/11/01 10:07:21] <Karkus> 4) Oh, okay, that makes sense :P
[2015/11/01 10:07:30] <Karkus> these were just examples though
[2015/11/01 10:07:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: What's the supertux chat room then?
[2015/11/01 10:08:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: This one, but the web interface we have on supertux.github.io
[2015/11/01 10:08:10] <mt> re 3) NOCs usually handle DMCA as well, if you contact them through the abuse-contact listed in whois
[2015/11/01 10:08:26] <Tobbi> later guys...
[2015/11/01 10:08:48] <Karkus> bye
[2015/11/01 10:09:10] <Karkus> mt: So, we should list those contacts in this list then !?
[2015/11/01 10:09:25] <mt> just remove the copyright thing
[2015/11/01 10:09:34] <mt> the other text is fine
[2015/11/01 10:09:37] <Karkus> mt: Okay.
[2015/11/01 10:09:41] <Karkus> Fine.
[2015/11/01 10:10:18] <Karkus> Done.
[2015/11/01 10:10:32] <Karkus> Is that everything?
[2015/11/01 10:10:41] <Karkus> ah wait

[2015/11/01 10:48:16] <brmbrmcar> I like irssi! :D
[2015/11/01 10:48:36] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: good good...
[2015/11/01 10:49:09] <brmbrmcar> It is awesome!
[2015/11/01 10:49:15] <brmbrmcar> Better than any GUI!
[2015/11/01 10:49:28] <brmbrmcar> Who is *?
[2015/11/01 10:53:09] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: It's not a user...
[2015/11/01 10:54:07] <Karkus> mt: Do people want to hide their addresses from normal users or from everyone (including freenode's peoples)
[2015/11/01 10:55:54] <brmbrmcar> Then how does this myterious person come on at night?
[2015/11/01 11:00:12] <mt> Karkus: well, some people want to just make it harder for others to see others IPs but even with cloaks it's relatively easy to get an IP (I've done this myself before for testing, actually)
[2015/11/01 11:03:51] <brmbrmcar> How?
[2015/11/01 11:04:27] <mt> I'm not going to tell just about everyone
[2015/11/01 11:04:42] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/01 11:06:07] <brmbrmcar> Do you know who I mean by *?
[2015/11/01 11:06:08] <mt> Atheme's and ircd-seven's source code is publicly available, if you have a reason to know how it works, read the code (or read more about IRC and think about how you could do that)
[2015/11/01 11:08:32] <brmbrmcar> Too complex for me.
[2015/11/01 11:23:11] <brmbrmcar> Just as well.

[2015/11/01 15:54:21] <Tobbi> Karkus: what?
[2015/11/01 15:54:27] <head8debian> Tobbi: http://paste.ubuntu.com/13075127/
[2015/11/01 15:54:27] <brmbrmcar> Pooe Karkus.

[2015/11/01 15:54:52] <head8debian> hehe.
[2015/11/01 15:54:52] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Caps.
[2015/11/01 15:54:58] <head8debian> Hi
[2015/11/01 15:55:05] <head8debian> s/Hi/Bye!/
[2015/11/01 15:55:05] <red_bot> head8debian meant: "Bye!"
[2015/11/01 15:55:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why was Hagel Tobbi wrong?
[2015/11/01 15:55:12] <brmbrmcar> Caps for what?
[2015/11/01 15:55:28] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2015/11/01 15:55:29] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: You meant s/Pooe/Poor/
[2015/11/01 15:55:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: Hagel = frozen rain in German.
[2015/11/01 15:55:31] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/11/01 15:55:51] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/01 15:55:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: Right. I just missed your point :D
[2015/11/01 15:56:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: Old people like me don't bother about making points.
[2015/11/01 15:57:13] <brmbrmcar> Frozen rain Tobbi.
[2015/11/01 15:57:25] * head8debian points at the point that Tobbi made that he doesn't have a clue what was the point that Tobbi made and that Tobbi thinks he is old.
[2015/11/01 15:57:40] <head8debian> Sunny Tobbi. :D
[2015/11/01 15:58:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: stop it, both of you.
[2015/11/01 15:58:18] <Tobbi> And yes, I mean you, head8debian and you, too, head8debian
[2015/11/01 15:58:29] <Karkus> TIL that wikipedia has a language named Simple English, which compiles complex, drawn out wiki pages into easily readable chunks. simple.wikipedia.org
[2015/11/01 15:58:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: good point. :D
[2015/11/01 15:58:31] <brmbrmcar> Frozen rain is softer than hail.
[2015/11/01 15:58:46] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: not really...
[2015/11/01 15:59:00] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Its like being hit with a baseball vs a pellet gun.
[2015/11/01 15:59:13] <head8debian> Tobbi: right? :D
[2015/11/01 15:59:28] <brmbrmcar> I like them both.
[2015/11/01 15:59:42] <head8debian> bleh.
[2015/11/01 16:00:20] <brmbrmcar> Frozen rain is rare.

[2015/11/01 16:04:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: I know it's great :)
[2015/11/01 16:04:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: isn't.
[2015/11/01 16:04:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, we'll stop
[2015/11/01 16:04:39] <Tobbi> Anyway, good night.
[2015/11/01 16:04:42] @ Quit: Tobbi: 
[2015/11/01 16:04:55] <Karkus> That was my fault :(
[2015/11/01 16:05:04] <brmbrmcar> Poor Karkus.
[2015/11/01 16:06:05] <brmbrmcar> Partly my fault.
[2015/11/01 16:12:43] <brmbrmcar> Early night Tobbi.
[2015/11/01 16:16:53] <head8debian> He can use the sleep. :D
[2015/11/01 16:17:11] <brmbrmcar> For lucid dreaming.
[2015/11/01 16:23:15] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Bit random.
[2015/11/01 16:23:54] <Karkus> Head8debian: Does incorrect capitalisation ping?
[2015/11/01 16:24:07] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: I k-now.
[2015/11/01 16:24:35] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Are you a lucid dreamer then?
[2015/11/01 16:24:54] <Karkus> Aka oneironaut
[2015/11/01 16:25:07] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/01 16:25:41] <brmbrmcar> I cannot dictatemy dreams though.
[2015/11/01 16:25:56] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: dictatemy?
[2015/11/01 16:26:01] <brmbrmcar> I am not one of those posh ones.
[2015/11/01 16:26:02] <head8debian> Karkus: Mattering on the irc client, yes.
[2015/11/01 16:26:12] <head8debian> Karkus: Mine wont i dont think.
[2015/11/01 16:26:27] <Karkus> head8debian: Err... Yes or no? Does it ping people?
[2015/11/01 16:26:29] <brmbrmcar> My space bar is unresponsive sometimes.
[2015/11/01 16:26:53] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: What's dictatemy?
[2015/11/01 16:27:16] <Karkus> Oh right

[2015/11/01 16:27:22] <Karkus> *sigh*
[2015/11/01 16:27:27] <Karkus> I'm tired sorry
[2015/11/01 16:27:54] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: I had a lucid dream once. It was, uneventful.
[2015/11/01 16:28:07] <head8debian> Karkus: Matters on the client. :)
[2015/11/01 16:28:12] <head8debian> karkus
[2015/11/01 16:28:24] <Karkus> head8debian: Oh, I see.
[2015/11/01 16:28:30] <Karkus> You pinged me then.

[2015/11/01 16:28:48] <Karkus> pong
[2015/11/01 16:29:20] <brmbrmcar> I know if I am dreaming or not.
[2015/11/01 16:29:47] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: That's not hard :P it's remembering to check.
[2015/11/01 16:30:07] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: I suck at it though because I have no dream recall usually.
[2015/11/01 16:30:43] <brmbrmcar> I don't have to think, it'sjust that I question wierd things.
[2015/11/01 16:31:06] <brmbrmcar> It never happens in real life.
[2015/11/01 16:39:21] @ Quit: leyyin: Quit: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
[2015/11/01 16:41:26] <brmbrmcar> Am i still connected?

[2015/11/01 16:42:44] <brmbrmcar> Yes, we do.
[2015/11/01 16:42:57] <Karkus> I think it's you that manages that right?

[2015/11/01 16:44:03] <Karkus> That's okay. Will it return?
[2015/11/01 16:44:27] <jeezy> i have to get a new prepaid debit card and some $
[2015/11/01 16:44:39] <jeezy> i dont know when that will be though
[2015/11/01 16:44:51] <Karkus> jeezy: Okay.
[2015/11/01 16:45:05] <Karkus> head8debian: You hear that?
[2015/11/01 16:45:19] <Karkus> I will tell Tobbi
[2015/11/01 16:46:26] <jeezy> it is only $5/month i was paying for that
[2015/11/01 16:46:41] <jeezy> not much at all; just have to set it all back up, get a means of doing so, etc
[2015/11/01 16:48:01] <brmbrmcar> You pay for it?
[2015/11/01 16:48:12] <jeezy> yes
[2015/11/01 16:48:13] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: someone has too :)
[2015/11/01 16:48:36] <jeezy> *paid for it
[2015/11/01 16:48:42] <jeezy> i wasnt able to renew it
[2015/11/01 16:48:44] <Karkus> jeezy: We're very grateful. The logs are quite useful.
[2015/11/01 16:48:49] <jeezy> just a simple $5/month vps
[2015/11/01 16:48:56] <jeezy> Karkus: no problem at all
[2015/11/01 16:49:01] <jeezy> ill have to redo it though
[2015/11/01 16:49:08] <jeezy> setup the bot again and stuff
[2015/11/01 16:49:10] <jeezy> they deleted my instance
[2015/11/01 16:49:19] <Karkus> jeezy: Damn.
[2015/11/01 16:49:23] <jeezy> which isnt good because i used it for other things; a little file server and vpn
[2015/11/01 16:49:30] <Karkus> Will we lose the old logs?
[2015/11/01 16:49:32] <brmbrmcar> I am grateful to.:D
[2015/11/01 16:49:39] <jeezy> yes, i lost all of my personal stuff too :(
[2015/11/01 16:49:43] <brmbrmcar> s/to/too
[2015/11/01 16:49:48] <Karkus> jeezy: Ouch.
[2015/11/01 16:49:56] <jeezy> it will be okay though
[2015/11/01 16:51:22] <Karkus> jeezy: Is there a way to set it up so it puts the file on a github pages web page, so you wouldn't have to host it?
[2015/11/01 16:51:33] <jeezy> the client has to run somewhere
[2015/11/01 16:51:33] <Karkus> Or is the bot also hosted there?
[2015/11/01 16:51:36] <jeezy> ya
[2015/11/01 16:51:55] <jeezy> bot and httpd hosted there
[2015/11/01 16:52:03] <Karkus> jeezy: Hmm...
[2015/11/01 16:52:35] <Karkus> It's a shame freenode don't do this.
[2015/11/01 16:52:40] <jeezy> true
[2015/11/01 16:52:56] <Karkus> ChanServ could log it all.
[2015/11/01 16:52:59] <jeezy> ya
[2015/11/01 16:53:13] <jeezy> i agree with this
[2015/11/01 16:53:14] <brmbrmcar> Who's ChanServ?
[2015/11/01 16:53:28] <Karkus> I don't think they'd appreciate me asking though.
[2015/11/01 16:54:34] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Automatically provided by freenode, to op Tobbi etc. and keep things in order.
[2015/11/01 16:55:00] <brmbrmcar> That is very useful.
[2015/11/01 16:58:43] <Karkus> maybe red_bot could log for the time being.
[2015/11/01 16:58:51] <Karkus> head8debian:

[2015/11/01 17:03:26] <Karkus> NATed?
[2015/11/01 17:03:27] <head8debian> Can any of you access https://www.torproject.org/ ?
[2015/11/01 17:03:30] <Karkus> What's that?
[2015/11/01 17:03:43] <Karkus> head8debian: I can, yes.
[2015/11/01 17:04:27] <Karkus> head8debian: What's NAT and why does that stop you O.o
[2015/11/01 17:04:45] <Karkus> Isn't it a headless PC?

[2015/11/01 17:09:09] <Karkus> head8debian: I fail to see why that's a problem?
[2015/11/01 17:09:11] <head8debian> Karkus: Hmm, im getting an encryption error on that website.
[2015/11/01 17:09:27] <Karkus> head8debian: Are you accessing it via tor?
[2015/11/01 17:09:32] <head8debian> No.
[2015/11/01 17:09:38] <Karkus> Oh.
[2015/11/01 17:09:46] <head8debian> Im trying to learn about tor. :)
[2015/11/01 17:09:53] <Karkus> head8debian: Why?
[2015/11/01 17:10:01] <head8debian> but the website is throwign an encryption error.
[2015/11/01 17:10:03] <Karkus> It's not difficult :D
[2015/11/01 17:10:05] <head8debian> For the fun of it. :D
[2015/11/01 17:10:32] <head8debian> But i have no way of sticking anything in my home network out on the internet
[2015/11/01 17:10:44] <Karkus> head8debian: Not a problem.
[2015/11/01 17:10:50] <Karkus> We can use a github pages page
[2015/11/01 17:11:18] <Karkus> head8debian: How reliable is your internet?
[2015/11/01 17:11:26] <head8debian> Karkus: Not very reliable. ;)
[2015/11/01 17:11:28] <head8debian> Or fast.
[2015/11/01 17:11:37] <Karkus> head8debian: We don't need speed.
[2015/11/01 17:11:53] <head8debian> We have it be very reliable at times... and have it down for a day another time.
[2015/11/01 17:12:03] <head8debian> I never thought of using git...
[2015/11/01 17:12:11] <Karkus> head8debian: Your headless PC is running linux, correct?
[2015/11/01 17:12:25] <head8debian> Yes. Debian to be exact.
[2015/11/01 17:13:00] <Karkus> head8debian: Okay.
[2015/11/01 17:13:09] <head8debian> You could use crontab...
[2015/11/01 17:13:20] <head8debian> And i can use sydneyjd.github.io
[2015/11/01 17:14:58] <Karkus> head8debian: If I created/found a quick python script, could you run it?

[2015/11/01 17:23:42] <head8debian> I already host huge backups for TSC, so why not. :)
[2015/11/01 17:26:35] <head8debian> What my parents don't know about my server...

[2015/11/01 17:31:46] <head8debian> Hehe.
[2015/11/01 17:31:53] <Karkus> Anyway, linux is fairly secure, so long as anything you run has'nt got sudo

[2015/11/02 12:00:29] <brmbrmcar> You should be careful.
[2015/11/02 12:00:43] <brmbrmcar> There is no encryption involved.

[2015/11/02 12:01:56] <mt> well, if you wait for nickserv's reply not, but someone could whois you when you're not in a channel (or MONITOR when it's loaded)

[2015/11/02 12:08:40] <brmbrmcar> How is SASL used on irssi?

[2015/11/02 12:12:21] <Tobbi> So, who added supertux to the list of channels?
[2015/11/02 12:12:27] <Tobbi> I mean of that log...
[2015/11/02 12:12:33] <Tobbi> I thought an operator had to do it.
[2015/11/02 12:13:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: Err... No one... hehe...
[2015/11/02 12:13:33] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, I tried it on https://botbot.me/ and it told me it was already added to the list.
[2015/11/02 12:14:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: I didn't expect it to work, but it was me. Sorry. I thought it hadn't worked because I wasn't an op.
[2015/11/02 12:14:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: well, it did.
[2015/11/02 12:14:27] <Tobbi> It's alright.
[2015/11/02 12:14:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: We'll see if anything comes of it.
[2015/11/02 12:14:47] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/11/02 12:14:53] <Tobbi> Or, wait, I could make you an op :D
[2015/11/02 12:15:27] <Karkus> I don't think that's how it works. I reckon someone will join and ask to speak to an op.
[2015/11/02 12:15:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: What can you do as an op anyway?
[2015/11/02 12:15:55] <Tobbi> Kick other people.
[2015/11/02 12:16:21] <Tobbi> Especially useful when dealing with overly annoying, overly incompetent, overly christian or other people who are overly something...
[2015/11/02 12:16:25] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 12:16:26] <Karkus> Have you ever had to kick other prople

[2015/11/02 12:19:56] <Tobbi> I actually have no idea how to give you ops.
[2015/11/02 12:20:01] <Tobbi> Actually, for a time...ä

[2015/11/02 12:20:16] <mt> 18:06 (brmbrmcar) How is SASL used on irssi? <-- for 0.8.17 and before, there's a script, for 0.8.18 (git master), support is now native iirc
[2015/11/02 12:20:51] <mt> If you have the +f chanserv flag, you could /msg ChanServ flags #supertux <nickserv account> +o
[2015/11/02 12:23:14] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am not authorized to add you to the op list.

[2015/11/02 12:23:42] <Tobbi> Which bot is that?
[2015/11/02 12:23:46] <Tobbi> Karkus: You are temporary op.
[2015/11/02 12:23:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Mine.
[2015/11/02 12:23:57] <Tobbi> Once you rejoin, you won't be op anymore.
[2015/11/02 12:24:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, great?
[2015/11/02 12:24:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, because if they come and check on your op-ness...well...
[2015/11/02 12:24:44] <Karkus> Tobbi: Then I will direct them to you...
[2015/11/02 12:24:49] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2015/11/02 12:24:53] <Tobbi> Yeah, that works too.
[2015/11/02 12:25:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: Can they 'check my op-ness' while I'm offline?
[2015/11/02 12:25:21] <Tobbi> I have no idea how they'd do it.
[2015/11/02 12:25:33] <Tobbi> Actually... They could check the op list, not sure if that's available to everyone though.
[2015/11/02 12:25:42] <mt> if you're a chanserv op, they could /cs access list #supertux
[2015/11/02 12:25:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah, I know it exists, but then...
[2015/11/02 12:26:08] <Karkus> mt: And you say anyone can so that?
[2015/11/02 12:26:49] <mt> unless the channel is set to private (/cs help set private), everyone can
[2015/11/02 12:27:31] <Tobbi> Okay, fine.

[2015/11/02 12:30:25] <head8debian> Not sure what that did... but thanks.. :p
[2015/11/02 12:30:26] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I never said that I didn't kick you.
[2015/11/02 12:30:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: You were given voice and then I took that away from you again.
[2015/11/02 12:30:51] <brmbrmcar> You said you had never kicked anyone.
[2015/11/02 12:31:00] <head8debian> I know what voice is, yet i don't know what it is. :D

[2015/11/02 12:35:40] <Tobbi> Who are Andrew and Sylvia?
[2015/11/02 12:35:53] <Hume2> Tobbi: Noone knows.
[2015/11/02 12:35:54] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: OK.
[2015/11/02 12:35:57] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2015/11/02 12:35:58] <Tobbi> okay.
[2015/11/02 12:36:31] <Hume2> And it was Arvid and Sylvia anyway.
[2015/11/02 12:37:40] <Tobbi> Some of the older levels are just... urgh.
[2015/11/02 12:37:48] <Tobbi> Not good compared to our standards. :D
[2015/11/02 12:38:02] <brmbrmcar> How many coin boxes do you want? Honestly.
[2015/11/02 12:38:39] <Tobbi> I wonder if SuperTux crashes if the number of badguys exceeds INT_MAX.
[2015/11/02 12:38:58] <Tobbi> or coins or anything...
[2015/11/02 12:39:06] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Read guide.txt
[2015/11/02 12:39:23] <brmbrmcar> Sorry,I didn;t mean you.

[2015/11/02 12:39:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: Surely that would be too much memory anyway
[2015/11/02 12:39:33] <brmbrmcar> I have read it.
[2015/11/02 12:39:37] <Tobbi> :D Possibly...
[2015/11/02 12:39:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: What is INT_MAX
[2015/11/02 12:40:06] <Tobbi> Karkus: Uhm...3 billion or so?
[2015/11/02 12:40:16] <Tobbi> wait, no.
[2015/11/02 12:40:32] <Tobbi> Oh, wait, yes.
[2015/11/02 12:40:37] <Tobbi> For 32 bit anyway.
[2015/11/02 12:41:01] <Tobbi> Ah, wait.
[2015/11/02 12:41:11] <Tobbi> 4 billion if it's unsigned.
[2015/11/02 12:41:18] <Tobbi> But I don't think we use unsigned.
[2015/11/02 12:42:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Maybe idk. Depend on your computer then
[2015/11/02 12:42:06] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/02 12:42:09] <Tobbi> Who cares, anyway.
[2015/11/02 12:42:50] <Tobbi> When I have kids, I'll buy this: http://cdn2.list25.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/babymop.png
[2015/11/02 12:43:40] <Tobbi> haha, this looks sünde.
[2015/11/02 12:43:43] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 12:44:07] <brmbrmcar> Why?
[2015/11/02 12:44:23] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What do you mean: Why_
[2015/11/02 12:44:24] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/11/02 12:45:30] <brmbrmcar> It is very silly.
[2015/11/02 12:46:09] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: hahaha....
[2015/11/02 12:46:47] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Northern Germans have the word "sünde" for something like that. but it's really hard to translate.
[2015/11/02 12:48:01] <brmbrmcar> They wouldn't do any work.
[2015/11/02 12:48:28] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Who wouldn't?
[2015/11/02 12:49:01] <brmbrmcar> The baby.
[2015/11/02 12:49:28] <brmbrmcar> And also, it would be hard for you to find a wife who would let you do that.
[2015/11/02 12:50:12] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: It doesn't hurt the baby...
[2015/11/02 12:50:14] <Tobbi> I believe.
[2015/11/02 12:50:27] <Tobbi> Also, of course they do work, they crawl on the floor, don't they?
[2015/11/02 12:51:17] <brmbrmcar> What if you slipped and fell on the baby?
[2015/11/02 12:53:18] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Depends on how good the baby's work was.
[2015/11/02 12:53:19] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 12:53:31] <Tobbi> If it didn't do any good work, it's a minor loss.
[2015/11/02 12:53:32] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 12:54:10] <brmbrmcar> The wife would go mad!
[2015/11/02 12:54:44] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What else is new?
[2015/11/02 12:54:58] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Besides, a flat baby is easier to store than one that isn't flat.
[2015/11/02 12:55:14] <brmbrmcar> The 54th minute of this hour.
[2015/11/02 12:55:17] <Tobbi> Ever tried to fit a non-flag baby in a drawer...?
[2015/11/02 12:55:23] <Tobbi> And now try with a flat one...
[2015/11/02 12:55:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: Surely they'd just push the dirt along.
[2015/11/02 12:55:27] <Tobbi> See: Way easier.
[2015/11/02 12:55:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: haha
[2015/11/02 12:56:00] <Tobbi> Probably...

[2015/11/02 12:57:42] <Tobbi> hahaha
[2015/11/02 12:58:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe so, but the rotation would make the baby sick.
[2015/11/02 12:58:01] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 12:58:33] <Tobbi> Karkus: A baby integrated inside a dishwasher...
[2015/11/02 12:58:39] <Tobbi> It's such a funny idea.
[2015/11/02 12:59:22] <Tobbi> Baby car wash...
[2015/11/02 12:59:41] <Tobbi> With babies holding towels and everything and being moved around the car.
[2015/11/02 12:59:43] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 13:00:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: Actually - dip the baby in water, let it crawl around and then toss it in the washing machine. Wait a few minutes, throw away (now disposable) baby and look at your shiny floor.
[2015/11/02 13:00:16] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/11/02 13:00:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: the "now disposable" really got me.

[2015/11/02 13:01:37] <Tobbi> Poor girl as well.

[2015/11/02 13:01:46] <mt> didn't you forget the disclaimer for americans? :p
[2015/11/02 13:01:48] <Karkus> Tobbi: Maybe I shouldn't have children.
[2015/11/02 13:02:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am not sure if I will. I can certainly think of it. But not within a 5 year timespan.
[2015/11/02 13:02:16] <Tobbi> Maybe in 10 years.
[2015/11/02 13:02:36] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Let me show you on the andrews_island_level1 how do I imagine that.
[2015/11/02 13:03:06] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: OK.
[2015/11/02 13:03:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's very difficult...
[2015/11/02 13:03:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: What is?
[2015/11/02 13:03:25] <Tobbi> Having children? For a  man, yes.
[2015/11/02 13:03:26] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 13:03:29] <Karkus> Seeing how my parents are, don't inspire me.
[2015/11/02 13:03:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know what you mean.
[2015/11/02 13:03:38] <Tobbi> Seriously.
[2015/11/02 13:03:50] <Tobbi> But, hey, what parents, anyway? :D
[2015/11/02 13:03:57] <Tobbi> (at least for me)
[2015/11/02 13:04:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: O.o ?
[2015/11/02 13:04:42] <Tobbi> Well...
[2015/11/02 13:06:00] <brmbrmcar> Babies are fine.
[2015/11/02 13:06:07] <brmbrmcar> After that though...
[2015/11/02 13:06:24] <Karkus> Babies are fine... compared to any other stage.
[2015/11/02 13:06:34] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I know what you mean: They are too fragile....You can't even reuse them.
[2015/11/02 13:06:49] <Tobbi> One hour in the washing machine and you can put them in a bin.
[2015/11/02 13:06:58] <Tobbi> Or in 2.
[2015/11/02 13:06:58] <Tobbi> Or three.
[2015/11/02 13:07:03] <Tobbi> Gosh, okay, this is getting nasty.
[2015/11/02 13:07:39] <Karkus> A couple of minutes usually does it.
[2015/11/02 13:07:47] <Karkus> Babies have small lungs.
[2015/11/02 13:07:58] <brmbrmcar> Do they not have any laws against this in Germany?

[2015/11/02 13:11:53] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: As you can see, I replaced all grond blocks with snow.
[2015/11/02 13:12:43] <brmbrmcar> I'll try to do that.
[2015/11/02 13:13:25] <Hume2> Thanks, brmbrmcar.
[2015/11/02 13:13:26] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: Using google.de to search something in English is plain wierd.
[2015/11/02 13:13:44] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: no.
[2015/11/02 13:14:49] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: yes.
[2015/11/02 13:14:57] <mt> google.com actually redirects to google.${cctld} if you're not in the US
[2015/11/02 13:15:06] <brmbrmcar> What is it in German?
[2015/11/02 13:15:31] <mt> (unless you click "Use Google.com")
[2015/11/02 13:15:37] <Tobbi> Firefox can't find the server at www.google.${cctld}.
[2015/11/02 13:15:39] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/02 13:18:44] <brmbrmcar> What a surprise.
[2015/11/02 13:19:05] <Tobbi> Indeed.
[2015/11/02 13:20:28] <mt> get me 200k USD and I'll register ${cctld} with ICANN and host authoritative nameservers
[2015/11/02 13:21:09] <brmbrmcar> Why host it in the US?
[2015/11/02 13:21:17] <brmbrmcar> It's too far!
[2015/11/02 13:21:23] @ purple_bot joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/02 13:21:30] <mt> Did I say something about hosting in the US?
[2015/11/02 13:21:53] <brmbrmcar> You said USD.
[2015/11/02 13:22:03] <Tobbi> mt: Have fun with that. Why not buy a house for that much money?
[2015/11/02 13:22:19] <mt> It's just ICANN that wants about 185k USD for registering a gTLD
[2015/11/02 13:27:36] <brmbrmcar> I want 5 exabytes of a nameserver.
[2015/11/02 13:27:45] <brmbrmcar> Just to waste space.
[2015/11/02 13:27:57] <Tobbi> I could've guessed.
[2015/11/02 13:28:21] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Do you want to install Windows 8 or what?
[2015/11/02 13:28:46] <brmbrmcar> I want to destroy Windows 8.
[2015/11/02 13:29:16] <Hume2> I too. I don't know any bigger waste of space than Windows 8.
[2015/11/02 13:29:19] <brmbrmcar> How about a little camera flashing when you type your password?
[2015/11/02 13:29:29] <Hume2> hmmm...
[2015/11/02 13:29:44] <brmbrmcar> It would creep people out.
[2015/11/02 13:29:58] <Hume2> I guess that Windows already do that stuff.
[2015/11/02 13:30:10] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/02 13:32:06] <brmbrmcar> How about on student computers, make the password requirements impossible.
[2015/11/02 13:32:23] <brmbrmcar> And then eeryone would be locked out.
[2015/11/02 13:34:16] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Good idea.

[2015/11/02 13:35:30] <brmbrmcar> Although a much harder attack.

[2015/11/02 13:46:51] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/02 13:47:08] <Hume2> And other thing is that I can go bellow all those things. You can put those non-solid tiles on foreground or background.
[2015/11/02 13:49:45] <brmbrmcar> I don't normally use snow.
[2015/11/02 13:50:25] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I know that working with snow is teddious, but the levels look much better then.
[2015/11/02 13:51:02] <brmbrmcar> I will push it now.
[2015/11/02 13:51:09] <Hume2> OK
[2015/11/02 13:52:19] <brmbrmcar> Done.
[2015/11/02 13:55:00] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Could you just do something with those darksnow tiles? When you are at it, replace them with the newer texture.
[2015/11/02 13:55:35] <Hume2> And do you know what I do with those block-texts? I personally put poles instead of them.
[2015/11/02 13:55:37] <Hume2> Thanks.
[2015/11/02 13:56:22] <Hume2> When I started this restauratory work, I thought that I'll spend 5 minutes on each level and that will be enough.
[2015/11/02 13:56:57] <Hume2> However, then I got that they are much worse quallity, so I spend awerage 30 minutes on each.
[2015/11/02 13:57:38] <brmbrmcar> It is harder than it looks. What do you mean by block-texts?
[2015/11/02 13:58:27] <Hume2> In the andrew's island level 2 it's the "land", "water" and "sky", those wooden things.

[2015/11/02 14:00:17] <brmbrmcar> I will try.
[2015/11/02 14:02:01] <brmbrmcar> I just made the clouds unisolid (the easy part).
[2015/11/02 14:02:06] <Hume2> I'm sorry if I tell you too many requests to you, but it's we who are responsible for this. And If you manage to apply any of those requests to one of my level I've restaured, I'll try to correct it.
[2015/11/02 14:02:22] <brmbrmcar> Don't worry.
[2015/11/02 14:05:13] <swift110> hey all
[2015/11/02 14:06:40] <brmbrmcar> Another update.
[2015/11/02 14:11:50] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I noticed that you made the clouds unisolid, but the darksnow looks still the same. Look at arvids_n_silvias_world_level2.stl to see what darksnow I mean.
[2015/11/02 14:12:10] <Hume2> Plus there's one obstructed flying snowball. Don't worry to delete it.

[2015/11/02 14:28:38] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You replaced andrews_island_level1 by alkatraz_level1.

[2015/11/02 14:36:33] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Nice, but I didn't say replace darksnow by normal snow. I said replace it by the new darksnow. It's in snow tilegroup at the very bottom.
[2015/11/02 14:37:57] <brmbrmcar> Sorry.
[2015/11/02 14:38:12] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: And also use the snow background tiles to make the chunks not levitating. You know, those: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/images/tiles/snow/background2.png
[2015/11/02 14:39:41] <swift110> hmm
[2015/11/02 14:40:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: So, on what day does the --christmas thingy start working?
[2015/11/02 14:41:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: Take a look at the code? I believe April 1.
[2015/11/02 14:41:40] <brmbrmcar> 6th December.
[2015/11/02 14:42:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: ...
[2015/11/02 14:42:05] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Did the darksnow thing.
[2015/11/02 14:42:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: Must it be a wisecrack?
[2015/11/02 14:42:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: What?
[2015/11/02 14:42:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: It looks good though. :D
[2015/11/02 14:42:47] <Tobbi> I know.
[2015/11/02 14:42:55] <Tobbi> But it would be nice if it would work on April 1st.
[2015/11/02 14:42:58] <Tobbi> For April fools day..
[2015/11/02 14:43:17] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Thanks, but now the level is unfinishable. And the coins right after the "sky" aren't collectable.
[2015/11/02 14:43:36] <Hume2> Or are they?
[2015/11/02 14:44:41] <brmbrmcar> I've fixed it.
[2015/11/02 14:46:22] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It's nearly finished, but there are still some minor things. Please listen.
[2015/11/02 14:46:41] <Hume2> At the very begining, there's a flying snowball behind the wooden blocks.
[2015/11/02 14:46:58] <Hume2> The darksnow at the run sign is still the same.
[2015/11/02 14:47:20] <Hume2> The castle blocks levitate. Elongate them downwards.
[2015/11/02 14:47:46] <Hume2> And there are still some senseless invisible blocks near the exit.
[2015/11/02 14:47:56] @ Quit: paroneayea: Quit: b
[2015/11/02 14:48:17] <Hume2> Also remove the roof at the sky section.
[2015/11/02 14:48:24] <Hume2> That's all thanks.
[2015/11/02 14:48:49] @ paroneayea joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/02 14:49:14] <Hume2> And one more thing:
[2015/11/02 14:49:53] <Hume2> At the begining, you get trapped when you fall off the platform. Put some spikes here.
[2015/11/02 14:50:14] <Hume2> I advertize putting spikes on background layer and making the background layer solid.
[2015/11/02 14:57:14] <brmbrmcar> What do you mean bu the roof at the sky section?
[2015/11/02 14:57:25] <brmbrmcar> s/bu/by/
[2015/11/02 14:57:25] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "What do you mean by the roof at the sky section?"
[2015/11/02 14:57:39] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You know, those brown blocks at the top.
[2015/11/02 15:00:53] <brmbrmcar> Done.
[2015/11/02 15:02:04] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: There's still something.
[2015/11/02 15:02:29] <brmbrmcar> What?
[2015/11/02 15:02:36] <Hume2> The top non-solid snow layer is missing at the places occupied by spikes.
[2015/11/02 15:03:14] <Hume2> Do it as I advertized, put the spikes on background and make background solid. Do you know how to make a tilemap solid?
[2015/11/02 15:03:32] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/02 15:03:40] <brmbrmcar> I did that.
[2015/11/02 15:03:51] <Hume2> Other thing: There's a hole in snow under the spikes.
[2015/11/02 15:04:00] <brmbrmcar> Do I neef further than -25?
[2015/11/02 15:04:15] <Hume2> And last thing, the castle at the very end is levitating.

[2015/11/02 17:06:18] <swift110> its cool that brm is playing supertux
[2015/11/02 17:07:03] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/02 17:14:51] <Tobbi> swift110: You guys know each other?
[2015/11/02 17:17:10] @ Quit: o11c: Quit: WeeChat 1.2
[2015/11/02 17:17:39] <swift110> no
[2015/11/02 17:17:50] <swift110> i just like hearing about people playing the game
[2015/11/02 17:18:56] <Tobbi> ah ok
[2015/11/02 17:21:29] <swift110> more people should play it
[2015/11/02 17:23:31] <Tobbi> swift110: If you want, you can motivate people. :P
[2015/11/02 17:23:42] <Tobbi> Plus, we should definitely have nightly builds.
[2015/11/02 17:23:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: Do you have a raspberrypi that could act as a build server? :P
[2015/11/02 17:24:05] <Tobbi> My rbpi runs openelec, so there...
[2015/11/02 17:24:26] <Karkus> Tobbi: What do you mean by build server?
[2015/11/02 17:24:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: Something that can pull the code automatically at defined intervals and can create executables.
[2015/11/02 17:24:55] <Tobbi> Aka, nightly builds of SuperTux.
[2015/11/02 17:25:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Does it have to act as a server itself to provide the builds, or only upload them to github?
[2015/11/02 17:25:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, if it could build stuff itself, that would be cool.
[2015/11/02 17:25:50] <Tobbi> But, wait a second, it probably can't cross-compile.
[2015/11/02 17:25:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: There are complications...
[2015/11/02 17:25:55] <Tobbi> I believe so.
[2015/11/02 17:26:01] <Karkus> That's what I'm thinking too...
[2015/11/02 17:26:09] <Tobbi> Maybe we should just cross that idea.
[2015/11/02 17:26:23] <Karkus> I will look into it: why not?
[2015/11/02 17:27:07] <Tobbi> Yeah, not sure. If you want, look into it.
[2015/11/02 17:34:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is cross compile from 32 bit to 64 bit possible?
[2015/11/02 17:35:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: I actually don't know. It might.
[2015/11/02 17:37:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: Nope, you cannot, it would appear. So that one's a no-no.
[2015/11/02 17:44:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hey, weekly is always a possibility
[2015/11/02 17:44:59] <Tobbi> That might work as well.
[2015/11/02 17:45:09] <Tobbi> There's not so much going on anyway.
[2015/11/02 17:45:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: nightly is a bit over the top, ^^^
[2015/11/02 17:45:24] <Tobbi> Indeed.
[2015/11/02 17:45:46] <Karkus> Tobbi: Are we talking linux only?
[2015/11/02 17:45:58] <Karkus> Or windows too?
[2015/11/02 17:45:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: Hmm, maybe, although Mac and Win would be great, too.
[2015/11/02 17:46:05] @ Quit: leyyin: Quit: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
[2015/11/02 17:46:07] @ tux|dude joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/02 17:46:08] <Tobbi> But that's something which might be hard
[2015/11/02 17:46:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: I can only think of one person whose job it is to build mac... things.
[2015/11/02 17:46:46] <Tobbi> ;) I know.
[2015/11/02 17:47:14] <Karkus> Tobbi:I guess I could test the windows executables/installers on my other partition.
[2015/11/02 17:47:26] <Karkus> But I know 0 about actually making them.
[2015/11/02 17:47:32] <Karkus> Do you use NSIS?
[2015/11/02 17:48:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: Uhm, possibly? I think we might.
[2015/11/02 17:48:13] <Tobbi> I know NSIS better than any other installer language.
[2015/11/02 17:48:40] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, you can guess who's job that is -.-
[2015/11/02 17:48:46] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 17:48:49] <Karkus> is it who's or whose?
[2015/11/02 17:48:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: *whose I believe.
[2015/11/02 17:49:06] <Tobbi> Karkus: English is not your first language?
[2015/11/02 17:49:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: It is, but that doesn't help because I seem to be the only person I know who exercises the ' anyway
[2015/11/02 17:50:10] <Tobbi> heh, alright.
[2015/11/02 17:50:12] <Karkus> Bobs Apple's for sale!
[2015/11/02 17:50:18] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 17:50:19] <Karkus> Argh my eyes
[2015/11/02 17:50:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: I once saw Bob,s Apples
[2015/11/02 17:51:00] <Tobbi> urgh.
[2015/11/02 17:51:00] <Tobbi> Stop!
[2015/11/02 17:51:04] <Tobbi> My OCD kicks in!
[2015/11/02 17:51:24] <Karkus> I don't like Apple either.
[2015/11/02 17:51:28] <Karkus> :D
[2015/11/02 17:51:37] <Tobbi> Well...I...you know...I had no choice.
[2015/11/02 17:51:39] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 17:51:42] <Tobbi> Actually, I did.
[2015/11/02 17:51:52] <Tobbi> I was asked whether Macbook or IBM ThinkPad.
[2015/11/02 17:52:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Linux does run on most Macs, you know.
[2015/11/02 17:53:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know. I don't have anything against OS X.
[2015/11/02 17:53:24] <Karkus> But, Linux... Nevermind.
[2015/11/02 17:53:32] <Tobbi> Exactly.
[2015/11/02 17:53:54] <Karkus> You can ask head eight Debian for reasons to use Linux I guess.
[2015/11/02 17:54:06] <Karkus> Or, anyone else who ever played supertux :P
[2015/11/02 17:54:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am happy with my Mac... I know Linux, I use linux sometimes...But still...
[2015/11/02 17:55:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: What about OrphanOS powered by orphan babies in a dishwasher? :D
[2015/11/02 17:55:41] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'd probably prefer OSX to windose, although there are some useful features on windose.
[2015/11/02 17:55:52] <Karkus> Powered by?
[2015/11/02 17:56:06] <Karkus> I suppose we could chain them to a turbine.
[2015/11/02 17:56:09] <Tobbi> hahaha
[2015/11/02 17:56:20] <Tobbi> So cruel, yet so efficient.
[2015/11/02 17:56:24] <Tobbi> more or less.
[2015/11/02 17:57:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: More or less, not efficient. But cruel, so I'm willing.
[2015/11/02 17:57:26] <Tobbi> I meant more or less cruel, actually.
[2015/11/02 17:57:39] <Karkus> That's better.
[2015/11/02 17:57:52] <Tobbi> I mean: Who knows, small children even like water parks. It's more or less the same.
[2015/11/02 17:57:55] <Tobbi> Except more water.
[2015/11/02 17:57:57] <Tobbi> And less space.
[2015/11/02 17:58:04] <Tobbi> But that's only a minor inconvenience.
[2015/11/02 17:58:07] <Karkus> :D
[2015/11/02 17:58:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: It would be the heat that would kill, you know.
[2015/11/02 17:59:14] <Karkus> Assuming the child kept its head above the water.
[2015/11/02 17:59:49] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2015/11/02 18:00:08] <Tobbi> I have nothing to say to that...
[2015/11/02 18:00:18] <Tobbi> except...
[2015/11/02 18:01:07] <Tobbi> Well, you know: It's common practice for children to make their first experiences with heat (hot stove etc.)
[2015/11/02 18:01:13] <Tobbi> So, it's just a little earlier than usual.
[2015/11/02 18:01:40] <Karkus> Usually after you brand them they stay away from hot things
[2015/11/02 18:01:51] <Karkus> I have gone too far now
[2015/11/02 18:01:55] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 18:02:00] <Tobbi> Karkus: There is no too far.
[2015/11/02 18:02:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: Besides: Have you ever thought about the hot stove's feelings? maybe it doesn't want to be touched by a child...
[2015/11/02 18:02:26] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, but you have to keep it slow to keep them alive
[2015/11/02 18:02:30] <Karkus> Argh
[2015/11/02 18:02:32] <Tobbi> Hot dishwasher water is definitely preferable.
[2015/11/02 18:02:36] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 18:02:43] <Karkus> Stop tempting me
[2015/11/02 18:03:09] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 18:03:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: I have not thought about a hot stove's feelings
[2015/11/02 18:03:17] <Tobbi> Well, you should.
[2015/11/02 18:03:30] <Karkus> Are you a hot stove, Tobbi?
[2015/11/02 18:03:39] <Tobbi> Don't think so.
[2015/11/02 18:03:43] <Tobbi> But actually, I couldn't prove it.
[2015/11/02 18:03:47] <Tobbi> I couldn't prove anything.
[2015/11/02 18:03:49] <Tobbi> Who knows.
[2015/11/02 18:04:00] <head8debian> Karkus: No, your cloak is doing its job.
[2015/11/02 18:04:00] <Tobbi> Actually, if that was a sexual innuendo...
[2015/11/02 18:04:04] <Tobbi> Or a sexual nintendo.
[2015/11/02 18:04:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: It wasn't
[2015/11/02 18:04:21] <Tobbi> Okay, good.
[2015/11/02 18:04:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: How's your marching band training going?
[2015/11/02 18:04:34] <Karkus> It wasn't the first, at least.
[2015/11/02 18:04:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: What?
[2015/11/02 18:04:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im not in a band.
[2015/11/02 18:04:51] <Karkus> head8debian: Great :)
[2015/11/02 18:04:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: You know, tanner always played in a marching band... :D And since I often confuse you with Tanner...
[2015/11/02 18:05:03] <Tobbi> Also, all americans are the same anyway.
[2015/11/02 18:05:08] <Tobbi> All americans play in a marching band.
[2015/11/02 18:05:11] <head8debian> Not quite.
[2015/11/02 18:05:14] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/02 18:05:17] <Tobbi> just barely then.
[2015/11/02 18:05:20] <Karkus> Eat macdonalds and have diabetes?
[2015/11/02 18:05:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yup.
[2015/11/02 18:05:34] <Karkus> hmm mcdonalds
[2015/11/02 18:05:35] <Tobbi> Or provide meat to mcdonalds...
[2015/11/02 18:05:44] <Tobbi> -> head8debian :P
[2015/11/02 18:05:45] <Karkus> I had a friend called macdonald
[2015/11/02 18:05:47] <Tobbi> Oh, wait, goat.
[2015/11/02 18:05:49] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/11/02 18:06:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: go to bed...
[2015/11/02 18:06:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Sorry, didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
[2015/11/02 18:06:39] <Tobbi> And I'm serious about that.
[2015/11/02 18:06:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: I didn't realise how active the forums are... I need to get active on there. Can you sign up for emails?
[2015/11/02 18:07:02] <Karkus> head8debian: Me neither, if I did
[2015/11/02 18:07:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: They're not *that* active.
[2015/11/02 18:07:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: Baa. :P
[2015/11/02 18:07:12] <head8debian> I wasj sut saying to go to bed. :D
[2015/11/02 18:07:18] <head8debian> Its like 11PM there...
[2015/11/02 18:07:25] <Tobbi> head8debian: Not quite.
[2015/11/02 18:07:27] <Karkus> *here
[2015/11/02 18:07:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's 12pm no?
[2015/11/02 18:07:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's 12am no?
[2015/11/02 18:07:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: yes.
[2015/11/02 18:08:01] <Tobbi> Uhm, AM
[2015/11/02 18:08:04] <Tobbi> Damn, confusing.
[2015/11/02 18:08:30] <Karkus> Hey, at least we make sense when it comes to half past 4 etc.
[2015/11/02 18:08:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's weird, but I can make all those jokes about babies in dishwashers, yet the thought of a dead goat gets me tears in my eyes.
[2015/11/02 18:09:07] <Tobbi> I don't know why that is.
[2015/11/02 18:09:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: I have lost a lot of my respect for humans
[2015/11/02 18:09:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: It depends on the human. I am not sure if I am the best example of a human.
[2015/11/02 18:09:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: Are you human? Can you prove it?
[2015/11/02 18:10:02] <Tobbi> Karkus: No.
[2015/11/02 18:10:05] <Tobbi> To both.
[2015/11/02 18:10:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: So you lied about not being a hot stove then?
[2015/11/02 18:10:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: Since when is the world binary? :D Not being a hot stove doesn't imply being human.
[2015/11/02 18:10:57] <Tobbi> I could as well be the scarecrow.
[2015/11/02 18:11:11] <Tobbi> Oh, wait but we've all been the scarecrow some day.
[2015/11/02 18:11:25] <Tobbi> Actually, star trek voyager reference went unnoticed.
[2015/11/02 18:11:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, I'm pretty sure you're the hot stove
[2015/11/02 18:11:44] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 18:11:46] <Karkus> sydney is the elephant
[2015/11/02 18:11:53] <Tobbi> Suits him.
[2015/11/02 18:11:57] <Karkus> "elephant in the room"?
[2015/11/02 18:12:06] <Tobbi> Elefant im Porzellanladen.
[2015/11/02 18:12:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: girls would disagree
[2015/11/02 18:12:32] <Tobbi> woops.
[2015/11/02 18:12:36] <Tobbi> I meant...
[2015/11/02 18:12:45] <Tobbi> "Elephant in the room" or "Elephant in the living room" is an English metaphorical idiom for an obvious truth that is either being ignored or going unaddressed. The idiomatic expression also applies to an obvious problem or risk no one wants to discuss.[2]
[2015/11/02 18:12:52] <Tobbi> Thanks for that, didn't know that expression before.
[2015/11/02 18:13:07] <Karkus> Elefant im Porzellanladen? What's that?
[2015/11/02 18:13:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Elephant in the porcellain shop.
[2015/11/02 18:13:30] <Tobbi> Don't know whether that's an English expression as well.
[2015/11/02 18:13:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: With the same meaning?
[2015/11/02 18:13:58] <Tobbi> No.
[2015/11/02 18:14:12] <Tobbi> Like a bull in the china shop.
[2015/11/02 18:14:13] <Tobbi> Apparently.
[2015/11/02 18:14:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Never heard it.
[2015/11/02 18:14:41] <Karkus> Is it literal?
[2015/11/02 18:14:46] <Tobbi> Uhm, no.
[2015/11/02 18:15:10] <Karkus> bull in a china shop
[2015/11/02 18:15:10] <Karkus> Prov. a very clumsy creature in a delicate situation. (*Typically: as awkward as ~; like ~.) I never know what to say at a funeral. I feel like a bull in a china shop, trampling on feelings without even meaning to. Lester felt like a bull in a china shop; reaching for an orange, he made several elaborate pyramids of fruit tumble down.
[2015/11/02 18:15:10] * Tobbi checks.
[2015/11/02 18:15:42] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/11/02 18:15:47] <Tobbi> Well, alright.
[2015/11/02 18:16:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: I just copy and paste, maybe this is wronf
[2015/11/02 18:16:05] @ Quit: Wuzzy: Quit: Wuzzy
[2015/11/02 18:16:13] <Karkus> Is it what you were thinking of?
[2015/11/02 18:16:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: yes.
[2015/11/02 18:17:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: I like trading idioms. Better a sparrow in the hand than a pigeon on the roof
[2015/11/02 18:17:22] <Karkus> iirc :D
[2015/11/02 18:17:30] <Tobbi> Besser eine Stumme im Bett als eine Taube auf dem Dach.
[2015/11/02 18:17:33] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/02 18:17:54] <Tobbi> Better a mute one in bed than a (pidgeon / deaf person) on the roof
[2015/11/02 18:18:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: You know: Taube = pidgeon, but Taube = mute female person.
[2015/11/02 18:18:21] <Tobbi> eeh deaf female person.
[2015/11/02 18:18:38] <Karkus> Mute means can't speak, right
[2015/11/02 18:18:42] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/02 18:18:47] <Karkus> Right.
[2015/11/02 18:19:02] <Karkus> Anyways. Gn now.

[2015/11/03 09:00:40] <tobbi> Hey, grumbel. Any other ideas regarding that error?
[2015/11/03 09:01:36] <tobbi> I know it's actually just a minor issue...
[2015/11/03 09:07:48] <grumbel> no idea why it is complaining about only that location, but not all the other ones where pretty much the same thing is done
[2015/11/03 09:08:05] <tobbi> hmm...
[2015/11/03 09:08:17] <tobbi> pretty much or exactly the same?
[2015/11/03 09:08:23] <tobbi> Maybe it is a false positive indeed.
[2015/11/03 09:08:34] <tobbi> Maybe I ignore it again.
[2015/11/03 09:09:14] <tobbi> Okay, ignored.
[2015/11/03 09:09:17] <tobbi> Who knows.
[2015/11/03 09:09:43] <grumbel> All the functions take argv[] and then pass it into other functions
[2015/11/03 09:10:09] <tobbi> grumbel: Maybe it's inside the function it's passed to?
[2015/11/03 09:10:17] <tobbi> I mean: Maybe the error is there.

[2015/11/03 10:54:41] <mt> in the future, use `cat /dev/random | tr -d -c '[:alnum:]' | head -c 12` to generate actually secure passwords
[2015/11/03 10:55:40] <mt> `cat /dev/random | tr -d -c '[:graph:]' | head -c 12` is even better (includes all printable ASCII characters except for a space)

[2015/11/03 10:59:33] <brmbrmcar> But it is not.
[2015/11/03 10:59:48] <mt> what key?

[2015/11/03 12:11:33] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: And since we have vertical wood, you can use it.
[2015/11/03 12:25:25] <brmbrmcar> I just want to know what is good for it.
[2015/11/03 12:25:34] <brmbrmcar> It is a very unusual level.
[2015/11/03 12:25:58] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I think, that it's good to keep the gravity as is.
[2015/11/03 12:26:52] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Replace the tiny logs with vertical logs where possible.
[2015/11/03 12:27:32] <Hume2> And it's always valid. I don't like levitating chunks of terrain, so elongate them to the bottom level border.
[2015/11/03 12:28:18] <Hume2> There're many level unusunal. That's the restaurators' work.

[2015/11/03 13:07:49] <Tobbi> Guys, I believe we should create a twitter account.
[2015/11/03 13:07:52] <Tobbi> And tweet.
[2015/11/03 13:08:05] <Tobbi> That way, we'll get publicity, and supertuxkart people can retweet...
[2015/11/03 13:08:08] <Tobbi> And stuff like that.
[2015/11/03 13:10:41] <brmbrmcar> It is insecure.
[2015/11/03 13:13:14] <brmbrmcar> Hume2:It will probably never be updated.
[2015/11/03 13:13:44] <Hume2> I think so.
[2015/11/03 13:14:06] <Hume2> I'll never go to twitter. It's too imperialistic.

[2015/11/03 13:22:07] <Hume2> in this situation: http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/d/d8/Howtonotdesignlevels.jpg is it possible to get hurt by the top spike even if I wanted to, from the current Tux's position?
[2015/11/03 13:23:32] <brmbrmcar> Maybe with an airflower.
[2015/11/03 13:23:46] @ alket joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/03 13:28:32] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Maybe.
[2015/11/03 13:29:26] <brmbrmcar> I will try and replicate it.
[2015/11/03 13:30:34] <datahead8888> Hume2, I can't stand the word, "tweet"
[2015/11/03 13:30:49] <datahead8888> It keeps showing up in news articles, and they talk about tweets in the twitterverse
[2015/11/03 13:31:07] <Hume2> datahead8888: Same for me.
[2015/11/03 13:31:11] <datahead8888> I feel sorry for future historians who will look through our news articles
[2015/11/03 13:31:16] <datahead8888> Our society has degraded...
[2015/11/03 13:31:56] <brmbrmcar> It it possible to hit the spike as little Tux, just about.
[2015/11/03 13:32:47] <Hume2> That's strange.
[2015/11/03 13:33:02] @ Quit: Tobbi: Remote host closed the connection
[2015/11/03 13:33:05] <head8debian> I don't liek twitter either. :D
[2015/11/03 13:33:18] <head8debian> I think i would rather use facebook. Or google plus.
[2015/11/03 13:33:22] <brmbrmcar> 4 no votes!
[2015/11/03 13:33:34] <brmbrmcar> Not Facebook! That's worse!
[2015/11/03 13:33:38] <Hume2> I'll bring my IQ table.
[2015/11/03 13:33:42] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/11/03 13:33:47] <head8debian> Diaspora? :D
[2015/11/03 13:34:13] <head8debian> I find diaspora complicated...
[2015/11/03 13:35:08] <Hume2> IQ -11: IQ frozen Twitter
[2015/11/03 13:35:19] <Hume2> IQ -22: IQ frozen Facebug
[2015/11/03 13:36:05] <brmbrmcar> What do you mean?
[2015/11/03 13:36:26] <Hume2> I made a table of miscelaneous IQs.
[2015/11/03 13:36:27] <head8debian> hehe.
[2015/11/03 13:36:52] <head8debian> If i *had* to use facebook for contacting friends, i would.
[2015/11/03 13:36:58] <head8debian> But just for that.
[2015/11/03 13:37:40] <Hume2> I'd use Facebug only if I typed there fake info about me.
[2015/11/03 13:37:51] <head8debian> Google is no better with your info... ;)
[2015/11/03 13:37:53] <brmbrmcar> What's Facebug?
[2015/11/03 13:38:21] <Hume2> Facebug is just a trollious meme for Facebook.
[2015/11/03 13:38:52] <brmbrmcar> In 2017 I'm removing Chrome OS from this Chromebook.
[2015/11/03 13:38:59] <Hume2> Never keep logged-in on Google account.
[2015/11/03 13:39:15] <datahead8888> brmbrmcar, Facebook has more people on it than google+, at least people that actually use it for social networking
[2015/11/03 13:39:33] <Hume2> Don't you mean Google- ?
[2015/11/03 13:39:52] <datahead8888> I mainly use Facebook as an instant message and people finding utility
[2015/11/03 13:40:11] <datahead8888> There are a lot of people I wouldn't be able to find without Facebook
[2015/11/03 13:40:21] <brmbrmcar> Google - Facebug = Twitter
[2015/11/03 13:40:23] <datahead8888> Everyone I knew changed their emails over the years
[2015/11/03 13:40:29] <datahead8888> So I had lost contact before that
[2015/11/03 13:40:42] <brmbrmcar> Twitter = hell
[2015/11/03 13:40:59] <datahead8888> What is heaven then?
[2015/11/03 13:41:05] <Hume2> That means that IQ frozen Google is IQ -33.
[2015/11/03 13:41:16] <head8debian> Ok, lets create something Open Source and Simple. :D That could be our motto.
[2015/11/03 13:41:36] <datahead8888> FlossBook
[2015/11/03 13:41:41] <brmbrmcar> Heaven = irc.freenode.net.
[2015/11/03 13:41:42] <Hume2> By simple mean simple, and not
[2015/11/03 13:41:50] <Hume2> "remove 90% stuff"
[2015/11/03 13:42:25] <Hume2> I can't accept thet there's something worse than Facebug.
[2015/11/03 13:42:30] <head8debian> By simple meaning my grandma could use it... yet not have it cover up to much stuff.
[2015/11/03 13:42:46] <Hume2> That's good.
[2015/11/03 13:43:00] <head8debian> datahead8888: Flossbook! uhm, sounds good, but a little teethy. :p
[2015/11/03 13:43:19] <datahead8888> I assumed you wanted to program a new social networking website, head8debian
[2015/11/03 13:43:22] <datahead8888> :)
[2015/11/03 13:43:37] <head8debian> Hume2: Good, you start coding a platform to do this from the ground up, datahead8888 will provide the money, and i will provide the front end tester. :D
[2015/11/03 13:43:39] <datahead8888> Now you have a catchy name
[2015/11/03 13:43:59] <datahead8888> Oh, now everyone thinks I'm a money bags...hmm....
[2015/11/03 13:44:10] <head8debian> It would be interesting thing to do, but how do you get people to use it?
[2015/11/03 13:44:16] <head8debian> datahead8888: Im joking. :)
[2015/11/03 13:44:46] <datahead8888> There are some people here in town who seem to think I'm a money bags.  I'm really angry with them.
[2015/11/03 13:44:49] <head8debian> But it would be cool to do, if it ever took off.
[2015/11/03 13:44:53] <head8debian> Heh.
[2015/11/03 13:45:06] <head8debian> The government seem to think we are money bags also...
[2015/11/03 13:45:16] <datahead8888> True
[2015/11/03 13:45:28] <brmbrmcar> floss.book
[2015/11/03 13:45:43] <brmbrmcar> supertux.floss.bok
[2015/11/03 13:45:47] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/03 13:45:48] <head8debian> you could make the code editible by everyone... that would be sweet.
[2015/11/03 13:45:59] <head8debian> Like in gitlab.
[2015/11/03 13:46:04] <head8debian> on*
[2015/11/03 13:46:27] <brmbrmcar> I know a bit about HTML.
[2015/11/03 13:46:31] <head8debian> I have no coding skills... i cannot even get squid to work right.
[2015/11/03 13:47:04] <head8debian> I know a bit of HTML also... but thats not quite enough to do something like this. It would need some server interaction. ;)
[2015/11/03 13:47:25] <brmbrmcar> Online Supertux!
[2015/11/03 13:47:29] <datahead8888> If you create FlossBook, just don't put a picture of a guy flossing his teeth on the front page
[2015/11/03 13:47:30] <Hume2> Yay!
[2015/11/03 13:47:40] <head8debian> Perfect!
[2015/11/03 13:47:41] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/03 13:47:48] <Hume2> SuperTux multiplayer online!
[2015/11/03 13:47:51] <head8debian> ~seen Karkus
[2015/11/03 13:47:51] <red_bot> head8debian: Karkus was last seen 19 hours, 28 minutes and 43 seconds ago, quitting IRC (Quit: Leaving) and a moment before saying "Anyways. Gn now." in #supertux
[2015/11/03 13:48:11] <head8debian> ~say Karkus Hey, did you ever get around to that log script?
[2015/11/03 13:48:11] <red_bot> hi head8debian
[2015/11/03 13:48:20] <datahead8888> You really should program multiplayer for Super Tux :)
[2015/11/03 13:48:21] <head8debian> ~note Karkus Hey, did you ever get around to that log script?
[2015/11/03 13:48:21] <red_bot> lemme take care of that for you, head8debian
[2015/11/03 13:48:35] <brmbrmcar> How would it work?
[2015/11/03 13:48:35] <datahead8888> (Internet multiplayer >:) )
[2015/11/03 13:48:39] <head8debian> datahead8888: Its been thought, but it woudl take alot of work.
[2015/11/03 13:48:46] <datahead8888> Yes, I was somewhat joking
[2015/11/03 13:48:53] <datahead8888> Internet multiplayer would be very hard to program
[2015/11/03 13:49:04] <Hume2> Milestone banana, who cares?
[2015/11/03 13:49:06] <head8debian> Also be very GPU heavy.
[2015/11/03 13:49:19] <datahead8888> Two controllers on the same computer would be easier by comparison, though it still depends on your game architecture, possibly
[2015/11/03 13:49:28] <Hume2> Yes, but still not as heavy to run Windows 8.
[2015/11/03 13:49:45] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Ik-now.
[2015/11/03 13:50:03] <head8debian> Or Win 10. :p
[2015/11/03 13:50:37] <brmbrmcar> I tried running 0.3.5a on Chrome OS, and the frame rate was unbearable.
[2015/11/03 13:50:49] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/03 13:51:01] <Hume2> I don't know how much RAM does Windows 10 need, but after two years of automatic updates those you can't turn off...
[2015/11/03 13:51:17] <Hume2> Yes, Google tend to be slower and slower.
[2015/11/03 13:51:30] <brmbrmcar> I should know.
[2015/11/03 13:51:34] <brmbrmcar> And I do.
[2015/11/03 13:51:55] <Hume2> Anyway I hate calling the broswer just "Chrome", when it's "Google Chrome".
[2015/11/03 13:51:56] <head8debian> Hume2: About 1.2gb with *nothing* running.
[2015/11/03 13:52:07] <head8debian> Me too. ;)
[2015/11/03 13:52:12] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/03 13:52:16] <head8debian> Chromium seems to be Ok.
[2015/11/03 13:52:35] <head8debian> I haven't noticed too much diference in speed with it over the last year.
[2015/11/03 13:53:04] <brmbrmcar> After just 11 moths speed has dropped by 30%.
[2015/11/03 13:53:09] <Hume2> Windows 8 on a computer with 1GB RAM, on that was previously Windows XP. Do you know what happened?
[2015/11/03 13:53:24] <Hume2> One control just melted down!
[2015/11/03 13:53:28] <head8debian> Eww.
[2015/11/03 13:53:48] <Hume2> Changing shape, don't turn off the computer...
[2015/11/03 13:54:00] <brmbrmcar> Not much worse than before then.
[2015/11/03 13:54:02] <head8debian> You can still do a decent amount with linux on 1gb ram.
[2015/11/03 13:54:14] <Hume2> That's true.
[2015/11/03 13:54:21] <head8debian> XP could do quite a bit on 1gb ram since the system only used a quarter of it.
[2015/11/03 13:54:35] <head8debian> Anything newer is not quite the same...
[2015/11/03 13:55:00] <brmbrmcar> XP is pretty bad.
[2015/11/03 13:55:18] <Hume2> Windowses just waste the memory, do you know why?
[2015/11/03 13:55:23] <head8debian> ubuntu doesn't do well at all on 1gb ram anymore,(configurations) but most other lightweight Desktop enviroments on other distrobutions act much better.
[2015/11/03 13:55:33] <head8debian> Even Lubuntu.
[2015/11/03 13:55:55] <Hume2> It's because when the Windowses waste whole memory by it's updates, there's not enough space for viruses.
[2015/11/03 13:56:16] <head8debian> Heh...
[2015/11/03 13:56:20] <brmbrmcar> I am on the cheapest CHromebook around, and Ubuntu works perfectly well.
[2015/11/03 13:56:28] <brmbrmcar> Even Unity.
[2015/11/03 13:56:30] <head8debian> Just run your OS in the cloud. :p
[2015/11/03 13:56:42] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: It has a decent GPU and probably more than 1gb ram.
[2015/11/03 13:56:59] <brmbrmcar> But I am running to OSes at once.
[2015/11/03 13:57:05] <brmbrmcar> One rubbish.
[2015/11/03 13:57:29] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Give Debian a try sometime if you need something to do... :)
[2015/11/03 13:58:09] <brmbrmcar> http://www.amazon.co.uk/Acer-Aspire-CB3-111-11-6-inch-Chromebook/dp/B00NWHUXIC
[2015/11/03 13:58:23] <brmbrmcar> I tried DEbian Sid once with KDE.
[2015/11/03 13:58:33] <brmbrmcar> I didn't like it much.
[2015/11/03 13:59:51] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Try debian stable and gnome or mate or something. KDE is very hard on equipment.
[2015/11/03 14:00:01] <head8debian> Ever harder than unity... sadly.
[2015/11/03 14:00:23] <brmbrmcar> Kubuntu is fine.
[2015/11/03 14:01:15] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/03 14:01:22] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Was it buggy, or what was wrong with it?
[2015/11/03 14:01:36] @ Quit: grumbel: Quit: Ex-Chat
[2015/11/03 14:01:44] <head8debian> I prefer i3.
[2015/11/03 14:02:24] <brmbrmcar> Debian was a bit buggy, and almost impossible to use.
[2015/11/03 14:02:39] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: It was debian Sid, what do you expect?
[2015/11/03 14:02:47] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Thats the unstable version.
[2015/11/03 14:02:57] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2015/11/03 14:03:03] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Jessie, the stable version, is very stable.
[2015/11/03 14:03:23] <brmbrmcar> Alright, I'll sacrifice some disk space ffor Debian.
[2015/11/03 14:03:43] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: How much disk space do you have?
[2015/11/03 14:04:33] <head8debian> Hmm... Flossbook... ;p
[2015/11/03 14:05:09] <Hume2> I think that it could be called Tuxbook instead.
[2015/11/03 14:05:56] <head8debian> meh...
[2015/11/03 14:06:04] <brmbrmcar> 3.9 gb, try not go below 2.

[2015/11/03 14:06:16] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Wow. thats not much.
[2015/11/03 14:07:27] <brmbrmcar> Crouton is small, thankfully.
[2015/11/03 14:07:49] <head8debian> Hume2: I wonder if something like that can be done mostly in the browser end, having the server do as little as possible... hmm.
[2015/11/03 14:08:26] <Hume2> We have to rob Facebug and occupy their servers.
[2015/11/03 14:08:44] <head8debian> hehe.
[2015/11/03 14:09:16] <brmbrmcar> Would it just be SuperTux on TuxBook?
[2015/11/03 14:09:46] <Hume2> SuperTux must be on TuxBook.
[2015/11/03 14:10:14] <Hume2> There would be also many other SuperTux stuff...
[2015/11/03 14:10:23] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/03 14:10:24] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/03 14:10:35] <Hume2> ... mainly levels.
[2015/11/03 14:11:15] <Hume2> It makes me cry that we don't have anything like this.
[2015/11/03 14:11:26] <Hume2> ...so far
[2015/11/03 14:12:32] <brmbrmcar> Poor Hume2.
[2015/11/03 14:12:50] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/03 14:13:06] <brmbrmcar> Down to 3.4 GB. This had betterbe worth it.
[2015/11/03 14:14:03] <head8debian> hehe.
[2015/11/03 14:14:21] <head8debian> Hume2: Cry that we dont have anything like...what?
[2015/11/03 14:14:36] <Hume2> TuxBook
[2015/11/03 14:14:44] <head8debian> Oh. ;)
[2015/11/03 14:15:07] <head8debian> Hume2: As in a physical laptop, or OS, or facebk alternative?
[2015/11/03 14:16:06] <Hume2> I guess it could be something like the old fan site, but with much more content.
[2015/11/03 14:16:43] <Hume2> We need some SuperTux-ish room decoartion.
[2015/11/03 14:16:50] <brmbrmcar> And it would destroy Facebook.
[2015/11/03 14:16:54] <head8debian> old fan site?
[2015/11/03 14:17:07] <head8debian> I havent been aroudn too long. :)
[2015/11/03 14:17:14] <Hume2> It must destroy Facebug.
[2015/11/03 14:18:19] <brmbrmcar> Agreed.
[2015/11/03 14:18:25] <Hume2> I have some SuperTux-ish room decoration at home, made from paper.
[2015/11/03 14:18:34] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/03 14:18:53] <Hume2> I have an iceflower, bonus block, angrystone and ghosttree.
[2015/11/03 14:19:06] <head8debian> I wish our talking actually went somewhere...
[2015/11/03 14:19:14] <head8debian> Meaning made soemthing...
[2015/11/03 14:19:47] <Hume2> I think that the room decoration is a good idea. If we thought something good...
[2015/11/03 14:20:13] <brmbrmcar> 2.6 GB.
[2015/11/03 14:21:08] <Hume2> My fireflower no longer stands, so it lies over the bonusblock.
[2015/11/03 14:21:29] <Hume2> The bonusblocks are good for storage.
[2015/11/03 14:22:24] <brmbrmcar> Did they take you a long time to make?
[2015/11/03 14:22:37] <Hume2> Not at all.
[2015/11/03 14:23:01] <Hume2> 8 minutes or so.
[2015/11/03 14:23:13] <brmbrmcar> Where are the kept?
[2015/11/03 14:23:23] <brmbrmcar> s/the/they/
[2015/11/03 14:23:23] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "Where are they kept?"
[2015/11/03 14:24:03] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I have them at home.
[2015/11/03 14:24:44] <Hume2> Normal cubic blocks can be used for decoration as well, but you can only stick them on the door, as Narre did.
[2015/11/03 14:25:20] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2015/11/03 14:26:04] <Hume2> I have also one clocks with Tux from Narre.
[2015/11/03 14:26:13] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Ass soon as I've tried it, it will have to be deleted.
[2015/11/03 14:26:52] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Awesome!
[2015/11/03 14:27:05] <Hume2> Let's think a new decoration.
[2015/11/03 14:27:17] <Hume2> Got it! Snowball.
[2015/11/03 14:27:26] <Hume2> Made of real snow :P

[2015/11/03 14:30:19] <brmbrmcar> DEbian didn't work.
[2015/11/03 14:30:40] <Hume2> But seriously, I have a ball made of paper with a snowball's sprite sticked on it.
[2015/11/03 14:30:58] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2015/11/03 14:31:39] @ Quit: darkbasic: Read error: Connection reset by peer
[2015/11/03 14:31:55] <brmbrmcar> So Narre made the clock?
[2015/11/03 14:32:00] @ darkbasic joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/03 14:32:29] <Hume2> No, he bought a clock and sticked Tux's sprite on it.
[2015/11/03 14:32:39] <Hume2> The snowball is easy. You just take some paper garbage, spill water on it and make a sphere. After it dries, it's stable.
[2015/11/03 14:33:22] <brmbrmcar> Blue water?
[2015/11/03 14:33:46] <Hume2> Yes, normal water. Any water should work after all.
[2015/11/03 14:34:36] <brmbrmcar> I get it.
[2015/11/03 14:36:17] <brmbrmcar> What about Mr Iceblock?
[2015/11/03 14:36:39] <Hume2> When you compress the paper properly, you need more paper, but the more stable it is and the worse you can read what was on the paper written.
[2015/11/03 14:37:45] <Hume2> Well, mr.iceblock.
[2015/11/03 14:37:58] <brmbrmcar> I see. Does all paper work?
[2015/11/03 14:38:34] <Hume2> All paper should work, except that shiny waxed paper.
[2015/11/03 14:38:55] <brmbrmcar> That is good.
[2015/11/03 14:39:34] <brmbrmcar> How big is it?
[2015/11/03 14:40:11] <Hume2> It's about twice smaller that a normal paper-ball.
[2015/11/03 14:40:30] <Hume2> It's because the paper balls contain much air.
[2015/11/03 14:40:34] <brmbrmcar> Nice and small. :D
[2015/11/03 14:41:06] <brmbrmcar> I like it being compressed.
[2015/11/03 14:41:36] <Hume2> You can also use the paper packages those are used for packing flour.
[2015/11/03 14:42:18] <Hume2> Those usually have no usage. I've tested them and it works.
[2015/11/03 14:42:23] <brmbrmcar> So most paper works.
[2015/11/03 14:42:36] <Hume2> Yes.
[2015/11/03 14:42:56] <Hume2> Even the old school tests work :D
[2015/11/03 14:44:05] <brmbrmcar> Nice destruction!
[2015/11/03 14:45:24] <Hume2> Well, what next?
[2015/11/03 14:45:31] <brmbrmcar> Umm..
[2015/11/03 14:49:39] <Hume2> What about real-life sized door?
[2015/11/03 14:50:29] <gynter> hodor
[2015/11/03 14:50:59] <brmbrmcar> But it should be too small for larger people to get through, like in the game.
[2015/11/03 14:51:23] <Hume2> Yes.
[2015/11/03 14:51:43] <Hume2> And what about an ispy with a hidden camera?
[2015/11/03 14:52:14] <brmbrmcar> Awesome.
[2015/11/03 14:52:23] <brmbrmcar> Going up should open.
[2015/11/03 14:52:44] <Hume2> Yes.
[2015/11/03 14:52:45] <brmbrmcar> But if you enable Jump with Up you have to jump as well.
[2015/11/03 14:53:28] <Hume2> And what about a lantern with LED diodes?
[2015/11/03 14:54:03] <Hume2> It would be quite hard to make to make it at least a normal durability.
[2015/11/03 14:54:42] <Hume2> So that would most likely require a 3D printer.
[2015/11/03 14:55:31] <brmbrmcar> But at least you considered safety...
[2015/11/03 14:55:47] <brmbrmcar> Fire is dangerous.
[2015/11/03 14:56:48] <Hume2> It would be most likely without the glass, because it's too expensive and fragile.
[2015/11/03 14:56:55] <brmbrmcar> Especially to print out.
[2015/11/03 14:57:13] <brmbrmcar> Plastic then?
[2015/11/03 14:57:33] <Hume2> Yes. It'd have to be.
[2015/11/03 14:57:57] <Hume2> I don't have any experience with 3D printing though.
[2015/11/03 14:58:11] <brmbrmcar> What about a floating light for it?
[2015/11/03 14:58:32] <brmbrmcar> A projector would do that job.
[2015/11/03 14:59:00] <Hume2> That would be quite complicant.
[2015/11/03 14:59:22] <brmbrmcar> Why not scrap the floating light.
[2015/11/03 15:00:32] <Hume2> It needs a fly that has an extreme burning durability.
[2015/11/03 15:01:12] <Hume2> And what about some worldmap roads?
[2015/11/03 15:01:43] <brmbrmcar> With a Tux vehicle?
[2015/11/03 15:03:04] <Hume2> Tux doesn't have any vehicles, so it must be without vehicles.
[2015/11/03 15:03:30] <brmbrmcar> How would you travel?
[2015/11/03 15:03:40] <brmbrmcar> Dresses as Tux?
[2015/11/03 15:03:59] <brmbrmcar> s/Dresses/Dressed/
[2015/11/03 15:03:59] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "Dressed as Tux?"
[2015/11/03 15:04:09] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2015/11/03 15:04:26] <Hume2> Or just show your position by finger.
[2015/11/03 15:04:55] @ Quit: darkbasic: Quit: No Ping reply in 180 seconds.
[2015/11/03 15:05:22] <Hume2> Or what about a rock  that you can grab?
[2015/11/03 15:05:27] @ darkbasic joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/03 15:05:31] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2015/11/03 15:05:47] <brmbrmcar> How would the level loading work?
[2015/11/03 15:06:40] <Hume2> You come into the room and pley.
[2015/11/03 15:07:06] <Hume2> Everything behaves as unstable-tiles.
[2015/11/03 15:07:29] <Hume2> When you stand on it, it breaks :P
[2015/11/03 15:07:44] <brmbrmcar> Expensive...
[2015/11/03 15:08:05] <Hume2> I think, we need something more functional.
[2015/11/03 15:08:26] <Hume2> The bonusblock is good for storage.
[2015/11/03 15:09:08] <brmbrmcar> Of coins?
[2015/11/03 15:09:30] <Hume2> Probably, but also many other stuff.
[2015/11/03 15:10:39] <Hume2> What about a necklease made of SuperTux coins?
[2015/11/03 15:11:15] @ tux|dude joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/03 15:11:32] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2015/11/03 15:11:43] <brmbrmcar> Like a safe.
[2015/11/03 15:15:10] <Hume2> And what about a pencil with SuperTux logo?
[2015/11/03 15:16:48] <brmbrmcar> Nice merchandise.
[2015/11/03 15:19:41] <brmbrmcar> Where would all this be?
[2015/11/03 15:20:00] <Hume2> I'm not sure.
[2015/11/03 15:20:42] <Hume2> Someone could make it himself.
[2015/11/03 15:21:13] <Hume2> ...or give it as presents for something.
[2015/11/03 15:21:15] <brmbrmcar> It wouldbe very expensive.
[2015/11/03 15:21:58] <Hume2> Except the paper-only stuff.
[2015/11/03 15:23:04] <brmbrmcar> Free!
[2015/11/03 15:24:49] <Hume2> I thought my own currency and I sell them for it.
[2015/11/03 15:25:05] <brmbrmcar> Supertux world!
[2015/11/03 15:25:20] <Hume2> That's what we need!
[2015/11/03 15:27:03] <brmbrmcar> Which country?
[2015/11/03 15:27:30] <Hume2> I live in Czech Republic.
[2015/11/03 15:28:06] <brmbrmcar> I live in UK.
[2015/11/03 15:28:32] <brmbrmcar> What is in between?
[2015/11/03 15:29:02] <Hume2> Germany.
[2015/11/03 15:29:23] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/03 15:29:26] <brmbrmcar> So there.
[2015/11/03 15:29:42] <Hume2> There will be the SuperTux world.
[2015/11/03 15:30:47] <Hume2> At least it will be close to Tobbi.
[2015/11/03 15:30:56] <brmbrmcar> Most of the developers live in Germany.
[2015/11/03 15:31:31] <Hume2> So it will be ideal I think.

[2015/11/04 10:05:25] <head8debian> Or someone...
[2015/11/04 10:05:29] <Mathnerd314> sure. can't guarantee I'll answer
[2015/11/04 10:07:26] <head8debian> Mathnerd314: Ok, so i need this to display the contents of the folder im trying to go into, but im not sure why it wont. I have 1 .txt file in there named 1.txt. it works locally, and ive pushed the changes, but to no avail. Do you know what im doing wrong? http://sydneyjd.github.io/logs/
[2015/11/04 10:08:01] <head8debian> /logs/1.txt is the fine i have in there for testing.
[2015/11/04 10:10:03] <Mathnerd314> well, you're using github. so step 1 is to read github pages documentation
[2015/11/04 10:10:35] <head8debian> That was what i was thinking of doing next...
[2015/11/04 10:10:39] <head8debian> Arg. github. :p
[2015/11/04 10:13:44] <Mathnerd314> step 2 is to google and find http://little418.com/2015/04/directory-listings-on-github-pages.html
[2015/11/04 10:13:47] <head8debian> Wow, they dont have much... maybe im not looking in the right spot.
[2015/11/04 10:16:09] <Mathnerd314> no, they don't have much. it's github, they charge for support
[2015/11/04 10:19:24] <Mathnerd314> if it's just pretty supertux logs you want, I'd try https://botbot.me/

[2015/11/04 10:24:42] <Mathnerd314> anyways, it seems clear you need to generate the index yourself. that script I linked should work
[2015/11/04 10:25:33] <head8debian> Ok, they are still proccessing our request...
[2015/11/04 10:26:03] <swift110> hello all
[2015/11/04 10:37:08] <mt> I'd host logs, but I have no idea why nginx has no permission to read znc's logs even when I set the directory to mode 644 >_>
[2015/11/04 10:37:39] <head8debian> Mathnerd314: Well, please try. It would be easier for you to do it than me.
[2015/11/04 10:37:53] <head8debian> mt: ^^
[2015/11/04 10:37:58] <head8debian> Mathnerd314: Sorry...
[2015/11/04 10:38:24] <mt> I already tried, and as I said. I have no idea why it doesn't have permission.
[2015/11/04 10:39:05] <head8debian> mt: Hmm...
[2015/11/04 10:39:18] <head8debian> What am i supposed to do? :D
[2015/11/04 10:39:49] <mt> Oh so I'd have to make the entire path listable for nginx
[2015/11/04 10:39:56] <mt> Which isn't what I want to do.
[2015/11/04 10:40:07] <head8debian> Oh.

[2015/11/05 17:42:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, it doesn't.
[2015/11/05 17:43:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: http://screencast.com/t/kMaZhnw5UjE
[2015/11/05 17:43:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay. It shows it when I whois myself so I was a bit confused:P
[2015/11/05 17:43:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, thanks
[2015/11/05 17:46:16] <head8debian> Karkus: hehe.
[2015/11/05 17:50:59] <Karkus> head8debian: I'm not exactly sure how to get the logs onto the github pages page...

[2015/11/05 18:14:36] <head8debian> Karkus: my biggest issue atm is making github display the contents of a folder.
[2015/11/05 18:14:56] <Karkus> head8debian: As in, not HTML files?
[2015/11/05 18:15:12] <Karkus> I don't really understand...
[2015/11/05 18:17:33] <head8debian> Karkus: Yes, as not a html file. Kinda like viewing your files in a web browser.
[2015/11/05 18:18:12] <Karkus> head8debian: I assume you mean automatically, so that you don't have to update it then?
[2015/11/05 18:18:20] @ FranX joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/05 18:18:40] <Karkus> head8debian: Because of course a HTML file could do that
[2015/11/05 18:18:41] <head8debian> Karkus: I have the rest figured out in my head to an extent.
[2015/11/05 18:19:06] <head8debian> Karkus: But how do you get the HTML file to automatically update based on the log?
[2015/11/05 18:19:08] <Karkus> head8debian:What is it you are trying to display?
[2015/11/05 18:19:59] <head8debian> I was hoping to copy my log to a diferent file each day, than have my github URL show each seperate log in a sort of folder view without having to update a html file daily.
[2015/11/05 18:20:37] <head8debian> Karkus: Sort of like this. http://team.secretchronicles.de/~sydney/main-website/
[2015/11/05 18:21:11] <head8debian> Karkus: Or doesnt that make sense?
[2015/11/05 18:21:35] <Karkus> head8debian: It makes sense.
[2015/11/05 18:22:31] <head8debian> Karkus: But github won't just display a folders contents!

[2015/11/05 18:24:02] <Karkus> head8debian: No, it won't, and if it's not as simple as that, it's not simple at all.

[2015/11/05 18:30:56] <Tobbi> okay...
[2015/11/05 18:32:52] <Tobbi> I'm always happy when people do SuperTux videos on youtube.
[2015/11/05 18:36:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: Who's done that?
[2015/11/05 18:36:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: a lot of people, for example this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikp_0fobG9A
[2015/11/05 18:36:55] <Tobbi> Even though it|s in English...
[2015/11/05 18:36:56] <Tobbi> well...
[2015/11/05 18:37:08] <Tobbi> eeh Italian
[2015/11/05 18:37:28] <Tobbi> But with an up-to-date download link.
[2015/11/05 18:38:26] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's more fun anyway if you get youtube to pass it through google translate
[2015/11/05 18:38:32] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/05 18:38:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: but not the voice.
[2015/11/05 18:39:02] <Karkus> No,
[2015/11/05 18:40:27] <Karkus> According to google translate he's saying some weird stuff..
[2015/11/05 18:41:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: Should i make a video like that? ;D
[2015/11/05 18:41:30] <Tobbi> head8debian: You don't even know a foreign language, except for American.
[2015/11/05 18:41:57] <Karkus> ayyy
[2015/11/05 18:42:04] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/05 18:42:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: Was that some kind of acknowledgement? :P That American is indeed a foreign language?
[2015/11/05 18:42:52] <Karkus> It was 'heckling'
[2015/11/05 18:43:12] <Karkus> Yes.
[2015/11/05 18:43:21] <Tobbi> Ah!
[2015/11/05 18:43:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: Thanks for teaching me a new word :P
[2015/11/05 18:43:46] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/05 18:44:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Wow, i can execute programs right in dmenu.
[2015/11/05 18:44:26] <Karkus> :D
[2015/11/05 18:44:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: I have no idea what the hell you're saying? Sprechen Sie German?

[2015/11/05 18:47:19] <Karkus> :D Penguins are the best :P
[2015/11/05 18:47:27] <Tobbi> Indeed.
[2015/11/05 18:47:28] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/05 18:49:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: You have to use I3 and this odd OS called Linux to understand. :D
[2015/11/05 18:49:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: <insert tobbi's favourite saying here>
[2015/11/05 18:50:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: o_O
[2015/11/05 18:50:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: I mean: "I don't know anything about computers"
[2015/11/05 18:51:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: You should give linux a try as a 'i use daily' basis...
[2015/11/05 18:51:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/05 18:51:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: I'd rather not.
[2015/11/05 18:52:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: Why? Gentoo would suit you perfectly. :D
[2015/11/05 18:52:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: Doubtful.

[2015/11/05 18:57:12] <Karkus> But the way I've done it is embarrassing to say the least.

[2015/11/05 18:57:24] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/11/05 18:57:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: come on...
[2015/11/05 18:57:40] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/05 18:57:42] <head8debian> Karkus: Why?
[2015/11/05 18:57:43] <Tobbi> I know.
[2015/11/05 18:58:22] <head8debian> Im thinking of just having my bot ump it in one big file and updating it once a day...
[2015/11/05 18:58:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: But hey, it deal with it
[2015/11/05 18:58:42] <Tobbi> Yeah, it does.
[2015/11/05 18:58:43] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/11/05 18:58:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: It would be great to have a date listing.
[2015/11/05 18:59:08] <Tobbi> So you don't have one big log.
[2015/11/05 18:59:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's not really a thing. It's being committed all the time :P
[2015/11/05 18:59:34] <Karkus> I just wondered if it would work.
[2015/11/05 18:59:35] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/05 19:00:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Not sure of the alternative though. Is there an easier way to upload to github pages?
[2015/11/05 19:00:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't think so...
[2015/11/05 19:00:34] <Tobbi> I mean: You could do fancy stuff with JSONP.
[2015/11/05 19:00:34] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/05 19:00:39] <Tobbi> Get the data from somewhere else.
[2015/11/05 19:01:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: Totally unrelated, but: Do you know the IT Crowd?
[2015/11/05 19:01:44] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yup.
[2015/11/05 19:01:52] <Tobbi> Karkus: like it?
[2015/11/05 19:02:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yup. Somewhere else?
[2015/11/05 19:02:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: I don't know. Not sure why I said that, it just crossed my mind.
[2015/11/05 19:02:55] <Karkus> That's how I understand the internet, like Jen
[2015/11/05 19:03:50] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/11/05 19:03:57] <Tobbi> Yes, I know that one.
[2015/11/05 19:04:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Wow, my IRC log is 1mb in here over 1 month...
[2015/11/05 19:04:14] <Tobbi> Karkus: so, purple_bot will remain active all the time?
[2015/11/05 19:04:15] <Karkus> Well, head8debian: can check it out.
[2015/11/05 19:04:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: No.
[2015/11/05 19:04:24] <Tobbi> hmm, ok.
[2015/11/05 19:04:48] <Karkus> I will see if I can add a delay, and then maybe run it on my RPi
[2015/11/05 19:04:53] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/11/05 19:05:05] <Tobbi> In a way, Jen is quite cute. :P But a little bit too old for me. :P
[2015/11/05 19:05:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: Can  i have 1000 commits with the same commit message?
[2015/11/05 19:05:31] <Tobbi> head8debian: of course.
[2015/11/05 19:06:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: https://github.com/Karkus476/karkus476.github.io/commits/master
[2015/11/05 19:06:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: You could, of course, always rewrite history :P
[2015/11/05 19:07:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: amend?
[2015/11/05 19:07:18] <Tobbi> Uhm... actually, that might be complicated.
[2015/11/05 19:07:24] <Tobbi> Let's stick to how you did it.
[2015/11/05 19:07:27] <Tobbi> Safer anyway.
[2015/11/05 19:08:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: What's the longest delay you could deal with for the log to update?
[2015/11/05 19:08:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: once a minute? What can you handle?
[2015/11/05 19:08:31] <Tobbi> Or every 30 seconds.
[2015/11/05 19:09:13] <Tobbi> head8debian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJXww8aizAM
[2015/11/05 19:09:16] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/05 19:09:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I was thinking every 5 minutes. You know it's actually having to upload to github every time?
[2015/11/05 19:09:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: Right! Okay, 5 minutes is fine as well.
[2015/11/05 19:09:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/05 19:09:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: Can you have it create a new file each day?
[2015/11/05 19:10:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: We'll see... This is certainly not a permanent solution.
[2015/11/05 19:10:17] <Tobbi> I know.
[2015/11/05 19:10:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: In fact, for now, I'm turning it off.
