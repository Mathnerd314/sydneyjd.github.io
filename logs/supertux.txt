[2015/11/06 11:42:13] <Tobbi_> Karkus: head8debian said "I am doing school" upon which I asked him who school was and whether she was beautiful.

[2015/11/06 11:42:45] <brmbrmcar> There is no advanced HTML needed.
[2015/11/06 11:43:10] <head8debian> Karkus: its hacked together. i have crontab execute a cp command, then i have it execute a git commit and push command and i have a ssh key set up between github and my server.
[2015/11/06 11:43:23] <head8debian> Karkus: Currently it only gets dumped to 1 file.
[2015/11/06 11:43:32] <head8debian> And my website is thrown together...

[2015/11/06 11:44:55] <head8debian> I could do more...
[2015/11/06 11:46:05] <head8debian> There, now its 5 times a day... that should be better.
[2015/11/06 11:46:12] <head8debian> I really don't want to do more than that.

[2015/11/06 12:15:31] <maths22> I'm working on importing my logs from irssi, and then I will try to make a better front-end

[2015/11/06 12:16:23] <maths22> Karkus: not sure, but the really nice thing about it is that, once I finish making my script, it will be really easy to import logs from irrsi if the logserver goes down

[2015/11/06 13:17:34] <Tobbi> Does "Please restart SuperTux for the changes to take effect." sound okay?
[2015/11/06 13:18:21] <maths22> Tobbi: what changes?
[2015/11/06 13:18:44] <Tobbi> maths22: Language packs don't work sufficiently until you restart, really.
[2015/11/06 13:19:26] <mt> can't that at least be considered as a feature-to-add? 'Make language packs works without restart'?
[2015/11/06 13:19:46] <Tobbi> Hrm, okay, I will take a look at it.
