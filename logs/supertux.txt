[2016/02/01 06:12:39] <snadge> i know this is offtopic.. but i just installed extreme tuxracer
[2016/02/01 06:12:51] <Tobbi> snadge: ...and?
[2016/02/01 06:13:01] <snadge> i cant help but feel that it sucks
[2016/02/01 06:13:07] <snadge> lol
[2016/02/01 06:13:23] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/01 06:13:30] <snadge> i've got hours of longevity out of supertux
[2016/02/01 06:13:45] <Tobbi> Oh, 0.7.0 was just release.
[2016/02/01 06:13:48] <Tobbi> d
[2016/02/01 06:13:50] <snadge> its challenging.. fun.. frustrating.. all of these things.. the contributed stuff can be very clever / creative
[2016/02/01 06:13:51] <Tobbi> of extreme tux racer.
[2016/02/01 06:14:09] <snadge> but extreme tux racer.. hmm.. i cant help but feel the mechanics of that game sucks
[2016/02/01 06:14:18] <snadge> and initial impressions are.. there is nothing fun about it
[2016/02/01 06:14:26] <Tobbi> :P Okay, I do get it...
[2016/02/01 06:14:35] <Tobbi> snadge: But SuperTux and the racer are completely different games.
[2016/02/01 06:14:51] <snadge> yeah.. i think i need to see a guide to etracer to see if im playing it wrong or something
[2016/02/01 06:14:56] <snadge> but i just find it very dorky to control
[2016/02/01 06:15:12] <Tobbi> snadge: I think that's the game, really. Last time I tried it was like that as well.
[2016/02/01 06:19:02] <Tobbi> Maybe I should contribute to that instead.
[2016/02/01 06:19:07] <Tobbi> It needs more work than we do.
[2016/02/01 06:19:56] <snadge> a 3d supertux would be better imho
[2016/02/01 06:20:09] <Tobbi> snadge: There is one...Supertux 3D on sourceforge.
[2016/02/01 06:20:09] <snadge> kinda like the 3d mario on the nintendo ds

[2016/02/01 12:05:10] <brmbrmcar> What happened to Notifico?
[2016/02/01 12:05:17] <mt> it's been replaced

[2016/02/01 12:09:40] <mt> what's wrong with it?
[2016/02/01 12:09:50] <brmbrmcar> I just don't like it.
[2016/02/01 12:10:02] <mt> there has to be a reason for that
[2016/02/01 12:10:04] <brmbrmcar> It sounds and looks awful.
[2016/02/01 12:10:18] <brmbrmcar> It relies on indentation.
[2016/02/01 12:10:50] <mt> proper indentation > everything else :D
[2016/02/01 12:11:00] <mt> >it looks awful
[2016/02/01 12:11:06] <mt> have you seen decorators
[2016/02/01 12:11:07] <brmbrmcar> Yes, butit shouldn't affect code.
[2016/02/01 12:11:35] <mt> it should, because improper indentation will sooner or later lead to a bug because developers won't understand their code
[2016/02/01 12:12:20] <brmbrmcar> I often change indentation to what seems best.
[2016/02/01 12:13:04] <mt> 4 characters wide, spaces; what Python uses and what is best for everything
[2016/02/01 12:14:48] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I suggest to you: Brainfuck.

[2016/02/01 15:21:32] <Hume2> There are double letters ecen in Czech, but for some reason.
[2016/02/01 15:22:45] <Hume2> It's only when a sufix ends on the same letter as the root begins or similar situations.
[2016/02/01 15:23:01] <brmbrmcar> Sufix?
[2016/02/01 15:23:03] <brmbrmcar> LOL
[2016/02/01 15:23:10] <Hume2> Prefix
[2016/02/01 15:23:20] <Hume2> My mistake.
[2016/02/01 15:23:31] <brmbrmcar> No,the spelling of sufix.
[2016/02/01 15:24:00] <Hume2> How is it then? Suffix?
[2016/02/01 15:24:30] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/01 15:24:37] <brmbrmcar> I think.
[2016/02/01 15:25:15] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/01 15:26:22] <Hume2> Can this be a [ci skip]? I'm not sure.
[2016/02/01 15:26:29] <brmbrmcar> Wht be?
[2016/02/01 15:26:49] <Hume2> That grammar and formating fix.
[2016/02/01 15:27:06] <brmbrmcar> Is it in /src?
[2016/02/01 15:27:26] <Hume2> Yes, it is.
[2016/02/01 15:27:31] <brmbrmcar> I'd be onthe safe side.
[2016/02/01 15:28:13] <Hume2> I think so. Eventually the next build will test it.
[2016/02/01 15:29:22] <Tobbi> Hume2: It can. Just make sure it compiles locally.
[2016/02/01 15:30:15] <Tobbi> It can be expected that whatever compiled before will also compile afterwards.

[2016/02/02 06:29:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: By the way: If a member function calls the exact same member function of the base class, it is obsolete, isn't it?
[2016/02/02 06:36:25] <Hume2> Tobbi: Indeed, it is.
[2016/02/02 06:36:43] <Tobbi> Hume2: Let me look through the code for any occurrences...
[2016/02/02 06:41:27] <Tobbi> Hume2: I wonder whether we should have a const version of the collision_* functions...
[2016/02/02 06:41:59] <Hume2> Tobbi: It has something to do with the objects.
[2016/02/02 06:42:18] <Hume2> For example there the on_ground flag is updated.
[2016/02/02 06:43:14] <Hume2> The const is only for functions those don't modify the object variables, right?
[2016/02/02 06:43:20] <Tobbi> Hume2: Exactly.
[2016/02/02 06:43:35] <Hume2> So they can't be const, I think.
[2016/02/02 06:44:04] <Tobbi> Hume2: If they only return FORCE_MOVE; they can.
[2016/02/02 06:44:10] <Tobbi> (some do that)
[2016/02/02 06:44:45] <Hume2> Yes, but is that possible, even when the function in the parent calss isn't const?
[2016/02/02 06:46:18] <Tobbi> Hume2: You know that you can have "collision_solid()" and "collision_solid() const" both in the same class.
[2016/02/02 06:46:51] <Tobbi> Oh, wait!
[2016/02/02 06:46:53] <Tobbi> Can we?
[2016/02/02 06:46:56] <Tobbi> I don't know.
[2016/02/02 06:53:23] <Tobbi> Hume2: What do we do about this scripting interface thing...?
[2016/02/02 06:53:33] <Tobbi> Scripting interface is not safe from memory access violations.
[2016/02/02 06:53:45] <Hume2> Hmmm...
[2016/02/02 06:54:00] <Tobbi> I kind of have an idea...
[2016/02/02 06:54:04] <Tobbi> But I need to think this through.
[2016/02/02 06:54:37] <Tobbi> Hume2: We need to change create_wrapper.cpp and add NULL checks.
[2016/02/02 06:54:49] <Hume2> I'll look
[2016/02/02 06:57:12] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2016/02/02 06:57:14] <Tobbi> I got it.
[2016/02/02 07:06:06] <Tobbi> I probably fixed it.

[2016/02/02 10:09:53] <Tobbi> I think this might be easier than using the text file approach.
[2016/02/02 10:10:03] <sydney_untangle> Hrm.
[2016/02/02 10:10:09] <sydney_untangle> Well, you can do it. :)
[2016/02/02 10:10:29] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: If I had a spare SD card, I could do it on my rbpi-
[2016/02/02 10:10:32] <Tobbi> But I don't have one.
[2016/02/02 10:10:45] <Tobbi> I could technically shutdown my rbpi, dump the sd card contents to my HDD...and then try it.
[2016/02/02 10:10:59] <Tobbi> But that wouldn't be a permanent solution.
[2016/02/02 10:11:39] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I just don't want something uploading to github constantly.
[2016/02/02 10:11:45] <sydney_untangle> 5 mins it more often than i like.
[2016/02/02 10:11:58] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Hrm...you're right. It's actually not that much of a good solution.
[2016/02/02 10:12:08] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: So, there we know what you can send me: A rbpi.
[2016/02/02 10:12:11] <Tobbi> (a second one)
[2016/02/02 10:12:13] <Tobbi> With SD card...
[2016/02/02 10:12:20] <sydney_untangle> Hehe.
[2016/02/02 10:12:32] <Tobbi> Currently, mine runs openelec.
[2016/02/02 10:12:38] <Tobbi> Although I don't use that very often.
[2016/02/02 10:12:41] <sydney_untangle> I dont have one myself, so why would i get you a second one? :p
[2016/02/02 10:13:05] <sydney_untangle> I have a beast of an old desktop that you can have if you will pay shipping. :D
[2016/02/02 10:13:21] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Sorry, have that myself. What does your logger run on?
[2016/02/02 10:13:38] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Another beast of an old desktop. ;)
[2016/02/02 10:13:43] <Tobbi> I see...
[2016/02/02 10:13:57] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: rbpi would probably be less resource-wasting...
[2016/02/02 10:14:04] <sydney_untangle> Not the nicest to the electric bill... but...
[2016/02/02 10:14:08] <sydney_untangle> Meh. :p
[2016/02/02 10:14:21] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: But i cannot hook 4 HDDs to a RPI.
[2016/02/02 10:14:39] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Why would you want to do that, anyway?
[2016/02/02 10:14:48] <Tobbi> Also, you can, if the power supply is strong enough, I guess.
[2016/02/02 10:14:54] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I use my server for backups and such.
[2016/02/02 10:14:57] <Tobbi> I see...

[2016/02/02 10:16:38] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: oh god.
[2016/02/02 10:16:42] <sydney_untangle> And it is my IRC client, my logger and red_bot's host.
[2016/02/02 10:16:56] <Tobbi> Okay, I will probably dump my SD card content to disk.
[2016/02/02 10:17:08] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: lol.
[2016/02/02 10:17:16] <sydney_untangle> Yeah, this thing is not being replaced...
[2016/02/02 10:17:31] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I want to try out botbot without jeopardizing my system.
[2016/02/02 10:17:37] <sydney_untangle> I'd buy a router with USB support before a RPI.
[2016/02/02 10:17:45] <sydney_untangle> Use a VM or something?
[2016/02/02 10:19:37] <sydney_untangle> Hrm... what else do i do with my server, oh yes, i use it as a NAS as well.

[2016/02/02 10:22:04] <Tobbi> Oh, yeah, a VM might work.
[2016/02/02 10:24:14] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: What else do you want my server to do? :p Im thinking of installing owncloud on it, but it won't be of much use if i cannot access it from outside of my home network...
[2016/02/02 10:24:41] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: That's true. I tried installing OwnCloud on my rbpi...performance was...urgh.
[2016/02/02 10:25:17] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: hehe.
[2016/02/02 10:25:24] <sydney_untangle> This has a little more resources. ;)
[2016/02/02 10:25:54] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I'd also like to install PFSense, except its BSD. o_O
[2016/02/02 10:26:01] <Tobbi> PFSense_
[2016/02/02 10:28:12] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: What's PFSense?

[2016/02/02 12:27:18] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I guess google would then hire me for sure.
[2016/02/02 12:28:04] * sydney_untangle gives up...
[2016/02/02 12:28:30] <brmbrmcar> A GPS isn't that much aroundhere.
[2016/02/02 12:28:30] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: What about giving me a new raspberry pi instead of "up"?

[2016/02/02 12:29:43] <mt> I didn't want to annoy you with a highlight :P
[2016/02/02 12:30:10] <brmbrmcar> Is that meantto be a ??
[2016/02/02 12:30:18] <Hume2> o-umlaut

[2016/02/02 12:30:41] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: LOL, I could buy myself 300 from the salary I'd get from a potential investor.
[2016/02/02 12:30:47] <brmbrmcar> Fine.

[2016/02/02 12:31:26] <brmbrmcar> I looked itup.
[2016/02/02 12:31:47] <Tobbi> mt: Would you be willing to host botbot instead of me?
[2016/02/02 12:31:56] <Tobbi> Botbot is actually better than this damn text file...
[2016/02/02 12:32:21] <brmbrmcar> A new botis coming?

[2016/02/02 12:35:06] <mt> hm, still have an almost-idle server in US-LAX

[2016/02/02 12:36:58] <mt> irssi + cronjob calling git, I guess
[2016/02/02 12:37:14] <mt> on that US-LAX server
[2016/02/02 12:37:24] <mt> I could probably host daily txt logs
[2016/02/02 12:37:24] <Tobbi> mt: How much do you pay for your servers anyway?
[2016/02/02 12:37:27] <mt> or monthly
[2016/02/02 12:37:31] <sydney_untangle> A cronjob copying the logs to a specified folder then uploading to github with git.
[2016/02/02 12:37:58] <brmbrmcar> irssi isn't involved.
[2016/02/02 12:38:09] <brmbrmcar> red_bot does it.
[2016/02/02 12:38:09] <sydney_untangle> Nope.
[2016/02/02 12:38:22] <sydney_untangle> red_bot does the logging itself.
[2016/02/02 12:38:31] <mt> Tobbi: 10 USD/month for my server in UK-LON (1 GB RAM, KVM), 0 USD/month for the US-LAX server (128 MB RAM, OpenVZ)
[2016/02/02 12:38:36] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: So this is how people make those crappy apps. http://mashable.com/2013/12/03/build-mobile-apps/
[2016/02/02 12:39:15] <mt> for the latter server, I however have access to an admin webfrontend that lets me create more containers on the same host machine
[2016/02/02 12:39:42] <Tobbi> :)
[2016/02/02 12:40:39] <sydney_untangle> mt: What is US-LAX?
[2016/02/02 12:40:55] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: That is a US american who is lactose-intolerant.

[2016/02/02 12:42:03] <Tobbi> We can meet up :P
[2016/02/02 12:42:25] <Tobbi> ...and you can bring the raspberry pis you promised me :P
[2016/02/02 12:43:19] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Will you have that app coded? :D
[2016/02/02 12:43:31] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Probably not, but I'd pretend I do.
[2016/02/02 12:43:40] <sydney_untangle> ...

[2016/02/02 12:46:49] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I am not the first person who wants to be able to have beaming technology or warp technology, either. Yet, no one has invented stuff in that aspect.
[2016/02/02 12:48:00] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: This isn't so complicated. :p
[2016/02/02 12:48:06] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Who knows...
[2016/02/02 12:48:12] <mt> In theory you can teleport objects over a maximum distance of ~144 km
[2016/02/02 12:48:24] <Hume2> For flat terrain it's not as hard.
[2016/02/02 12:48:34] <mt> However, you need very much energy
[2016/02/02 12:48:38] <Hume2> However, tell me which field is totally flat.
[2016/02/02 12:48:50] <Tobbi> mt: And if we teleport humans, they'd likely be dead then, won't they?
[2016/02/02 12:49:04] <mt> most likely
[2016/02/02 12:49:13] <brmbrmcar> To much FORCE
[2016/02/02 12:49:14] <mt> if we made progress, they'd only have cancer
[2016/02/02 12:49:20] <brmbrmcar> s/To/Too/
[2016/02/02 12:49:20] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "Too much FORCE"
[2016/02/02 12:49:31] <Hume2> cancer :D
[2016/02/02 12:49:49] <brmbrmcar> Teleporting is impossible.
[2016/02/02 12:50:01] <Hume2> It's like 3D printer :D
[2016/02/02 12:50:06] <brmbrmcar> JUst moving too quickly for systems to pickup movement.
[2016/02/02 12:51:07] <Hume2> If we teleported the signal across the computer, we could have faster computers.
[2016/02/02 12:51:49] <brmbrmcar> What is this teleporting rubbish?
[2016/02/02 12:52:14] <brmbrmcar> Do I have a different definition of teleport?
[2016/02/02 12:52:41] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Teleport != Airport you see on TV.
[2016/02/02 12:52:44] * sydney_untangle cries...
[2016/02/02 12:52:53] * Hume2 teleports
[2016/02/02 12:53:05] <mt> Hume2: I wonder why no one has yet created network interfaces using quantum technology
[2016/02/02 12:53:26] <Hume2> It's too expensive I think.
[2016/02/02 12:53:31] <mt> like I mean this thing that specifies that if you change something with one particle, the other will react too, faster than light
[2016/02/02 12:53:40] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2016/02/02 12:53:45] <mt> That would allow us to have a global maximum latency of 0 ms
[2016/02/02 12:54:10] <Hume2> I think that Microsoft needs such speed :P
[2016/02/02 12:54:23] <Tobbi> mt: How far are we art implementing that? Is there a proposal?
[2016/02/02 12:54:31] <Tobbi> s/art/with
[2016/02/02 12:54:32] <Tobbi> s/art/with/
[2016/02/02 12:54:32] <red_bot> Tobbi meant: "s/with/with"
[2016/02/02 12:54:36] <mt> no
[2016/02/02 12:54:46] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/02/02 12:54:47] <brmbrmcar> These quantum technologies are VERY far into the future.

[2016/02/02 12:58:12] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Having no money would ruin the world as well.
[2016/02/02 12:58:12] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/02 12:58:41] <Hume2> I think that the money is now just a couple of numbers.

[2016/02/02 13:04:10] <mt> brmbrmcar: (italic doesn't display as well here, it's probably because there's no italic fontface of this family)
[2016/02/02 13:04:17] <brmbrmcar> OK
[2016/02/02 13:04:25] <Hume2> If you copy it to an editor with a proportional charset, it should display correctly.

[2016/02/02 13:16:54] <mt> however
[2016/02/02 13:17:02] <mt> I'd generally suggest +S (SSL-only)
[2016/02/02 13:17:07] <Tobbi> talk to you guys later.
[2016/02/02 13:17:14] <brmbrmcar> How do you use SSL?
[2016/02/02 13:17:17] <mt> SSL-only because http://www.charybdis.io/2016/01/30/charybdis-and-ircv3-3-sts.html
[2016/02/02 13:17:32] <mt> brmbrmcar: you configure your client to use it, duh

[2016/02/02 13:18:24] <brmbrmcar> You  just enable SSL?

[2016/02/02 13:19:05] <brmbrmcar> How do I automate that.
[2016/02/02 13:19:07] <brmbrmcar> ?
[2016/02/02 13:19:19] <mt> automate?
[2016/02/02 13:19:27] <mt> if you /save in irssi
[2016/02/02 13:19:33] <mt> it will keep the configuration
[2016/02/02 13:19:38] <mt> after restarts
[2016/02/02 13:19:46] <brmbrmcar> And that will replace the old one?
[2016/02/02 13:19:55] <mt> what old one?
[2016/02/02 13:20:02] <brmbrmcar> THeone I have on now.
[2016/02/02 13:20:09] <mt> what is the one?
[2016/02/02 13:20:11] <brmbrmcar> But I saved it differently.
[2016/02/02 13:20:21] <brmbrmcar> THe auto-conection.
[2016/02/02 13:20:43] <mt> brmbrmcar: the ssl options also work for /server
[2016/02/02 13:20:49] <mt> which is, after /save, permanent
[2016/02/02 13:20:56] <sydney_untangle> So, here is a question. My grandma has a laptop with UEFI, but i would like to wipe it and install debian on it, but im wondering if its that simple. I have secure boot turned off.
[2016/02/02 13:20:56] <brmbrmcar> Shall I just run it?
[2016/02/02 13:21:02] <mt> and
[2016/02/02 13:21:04] <mt> 19:20     When using the ADD parameter on a server that already exists, the
[2016/02/02 13:21:07] <mt> 19:20     configuration will be merged with each other.
[2016/02/02 13:21:10] <mt> see /help server
[2016/02/02 13:21:28] <mt> you obviously then need to reconnect to make the change effective
[2016/02/02 13:22:01] <brmbrmcar> I did that, just runs freenode2.
[2016/02/02 13:22:14] <brmbrmcar> No SASL even
[2016/02/02 13:22:44] <brmbrmcar> Nothing.
[2016/02/02 13:22:45] <sydney_untangle> Do any of you have one of these machines with UEFI?
[2016/02/02 13:23:30] @ Quit: brmbrmcar: Quit: restart
[2016/02/02 13:23:47] <mt> I have an UEFI mainboard, don't know if it's a proper implementation though
[2016/02/02 13:23:57] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/02 13:24:19] <mt> proper implementation = rm -rf /sys/firmare/efi is recoverable
[2016/02/02 13:24:26] <sydney_untangle> Not fun... I like the good old bios.
[2016/02/02 13:24:33] <mt> UEFI <3
[2016/02/02 13:24:38] <mt> if properly implemented
[2016/02/02 13:24:41] <mt> I mean heh
[2016/02/02 13:24:42] <sydney_untangle> True.
[2016/02/02 13:24:47] <mt> you can boot without bootloader
[2016/02/02 13:25:04] <mt> folks, DON'T RUN THAT RM COMMAND ABOVE
[2016/02/02 13:25:22] <sydney_untangle> lol. ;)

[2016/02/02 14:33:39] <Hume2> Finally done.
[2016/02/02 14:34:07] <Hume2> When it's 8×10, the dpi doesn't matter.
[2016/02/02 14:34:54] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2016/02/02 14:36:08] <Hume2> It's just a couople of black and white squares.
[2016/02/02 14:36:30] <Hume2> When ecah square was 1px, the result would be the same.
[2016/02/02 14:36:49] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 14:37:46] <brmbrmcar> What did you jus do?
[2016/02/02 14:38:21] <Hume2> The chessboard.
[2016/02/02 14:39:00] <brmbrmcar> It took a long time then.
[2016/02/02 14:39:09] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/02 14:39:22] <brmbrmcar> Our laser is very qick.
[2016/02/02 14:39:31] <brmbrmcar> Never used it myself.
[2016/02/02 14:40:05] <Hume2> It was printed quickly, but putting it all together toke so long time.
[2016/02/02 14:40:34] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2016/02/02 14:40:50] <brmbrmcar> Was there a large border then?
[2016/02/02 14:41:32] <Hume2> Not large, but there was on echa page.
[2016/02/02 14:41:38] <Hume2> *each
[2016/02/02 14:42:06] <brmbrmcar> Did you hide it?
[2016/02/02 14:42:20] <Hume2> No, I cut it off.
[2016/02/02 14:42:55] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2016/02/02 14:43:02] <Hume2> I'll write the coordinates on the tiles at the edges.
[2016/02/02 14:43:02] <brmbrmcar> Easier to play.
[2016/02/02 14:43:07] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 14:44:11] <brmbrmcar> I want a giant printer, and then to stick a load of pages together.#
[2016/02/02 14:44:24] <brmbrmcar> It would be super-giant more quickly.
[2016/02/02 14:44:32] <brmbrmcar> 4913x4913.
[2016/02/02 14:44:35] <Hume2> :D That I'd like too.
[2016/02/02 14:45:49] <brmbrmcar> How long would that ake with A4?
[2016/02/02 14:46:14] <Hume2> I'll calculate it.
[2016/02/02 14:46:56] <Hume2> It would be 302580 pages. o.O
[2016/02/02 14:47:07] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 14:48:02] <brmbrmcar> I want it!
[2016/02/02 14:48:16] <brmbrmcar> I need a load of paper.
[2016/02/02 14:48:26] <Hume2> And ink :D
[2016/02/02 14:48:33] @ swift110_ joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/02 14:48:55] <brmbrmcar> A lot of ink.
[2016/02/02 14:49:11] <Hume2> I have a lot of paper, but not even 302580 pages.
[2016/02/02 14:49:14] <brmbrmcar> Iwaste ink at school deliberately.
[2016/02/02 14:49:37] <Hume2> I too.
[2016/02/02 14:49:37] <brmbrmcar> I just extract ink fromthere.
[2016/02/02 14:50:01] <Hume2> I usually draw useless drawings.
[2016/02/02 14:50:10] <brmbrmcar> The only disadvantage is I can't eat it afterwards.
[2016/02/02 14:50:20] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 14:50:38] <brmbrmcar> I scribble over the school logos in tests.
[2016/02/02 14:50:44] <Hume2> I try to not waste it, but it's hard.
[2016/02/02 14:50:47] <brmbrmcar> Internal tests.
[2016/02/02 14:50:55] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2016/02/02 14:50:59] @ bb010g_ joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/02 14:51:07] <Hume2> Yeah, tests.
[2016/02/02 14:51:09] @ Quit: bb010g: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2016/02/02 14:51:39] <brmbrmcar> I always draw a hedgehog too.
[2016/02/02 14:51:40] <Hume2> I used to store them for insane long time, but now I use them as a paper that is used from one side.
[2016/02/02 14:51:46] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 14:52:08] <Hume2> My drawings are something abstract usually.
[2016/02/02 14:52:31] @ bb010g_ is now known as bb010g
[2016/02/02 14:52:32] <Hume2> Or i edit the text to make something funny :D
[2016/02/02 14:53:23] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 14:53:39] <Hume2> Minor edits can change the meaning rapidly.
[2016/02/02 14:53:46] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 14:54:04] <brmbrmcar> If Imake anerror tjough,I just scribble it right out.
[2016/02/02 14:54:27] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/02 14:54:31] <brmbrmcar> Maybe I should just change the meaning, and lave it.
[2016/02/02 14:54:41] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 14:54:47] <brmbrmcar> Ijust right "brm brm car" over it.
[2016/02/02 14:54:57] <brmbrmcar> HIdes all gaps.
[2016/02/02 14:55:12] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 14:55:39] <Hume2> I usually turn some sentences to negative.
[2016/02/02 14:55:45] <brmbrmcar> Or what I meant to put.
[2016/02/02 14:55:46] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 14:56:55] <Hume2> Sometimes there's a form on the other side, not relevent to the test, so I fill in some nonsenses.
[2016/02/02 14:57:29] <brmbrmcar> I do that with proper, serious parts.
[2016/02/02 14:57:48] <brmbrmcar> I shouldn't but it tests the strictness of marking.
[2016/02/02 14:58:13] <Hume2> I've once done it with tax return :D
[2016/02/02 14:58:21] <Hume2> Not mine :D
[2016/02/02 14:58:36] <brmbrmcar> :D

[2016/02/02 14:59:44] <Hume2> When there's a form where they were supposed to tick A B C or D, I puth there an E and tick it.
[2016/02/02 15:00:16] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:00:48] <brmbrmcar> They seem to drop that thing aroun here.
[2016/02/02 15:00:58] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/02 15:01:14] <brmbrmcar> Probably a pathetixc attempt to stop cheating.
[2016/02/02 15:01:53] <Hume2> Maybe.
[2016/02/02 15:02:17] <Hume2> I think that they should allow to cheat, because noone remembers all those ᑎ̲.
[2016/02/02 15:02:37] <Hume2> Well, some students do.
[2016/02/02 15:02:39] <brmbrmcar> Wit for the ,ogs then.
[2016/02/02 15:03:29] <brmbrmcar> I like voiding my work.
[2016/02/02 15:04:11] <Hume2> I too, sometimes.
[2016/02/02 15:04:34] <Hume2> I have a collection of paper boats made of English tests :D
[2016/02/02 15:04:41] <brmbrmcar> Once I din't want to take part in this competition, so I said I was zero.
[2016/02/02 15:04:49] <brmbrmcar> I don't try that.
[2016/02/02 15:05:21] <brmbrmcar> Some peopke will accept that if you give it too them to mark.
[2016/02/02 15:05:32] <Hume2> "The competitions are always won by someone else."
[2016/02/02 15:05:57] <brmbrmcar> It doesn't say "don't make this into a boat," does it?
[2016/02/02 15:06:11] <Hume2> No, it doesn't.
[2016/02/02 15:06:31] <brmbrmcar> There is no definition of anything.
[2016/02/02 15:06:36] <Hume2> Once we had to return that test, but I had already made that boat.
[2016/02/02 15:06:49] <brmbrmcar> That is not really void, but most will say so. :D
[2016/02/02 15:06:57] <brmbrmcar> Any trouble?
[2016/02/02 15:07:04] <Hume2> Not really.
[2016/02/02 15:07:21] <Hume2> The teacher was just a bit annoyed.
[2016/02/02 15:07:31] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2016/02/02 15:08:18] <Hume2> I usually void those small tests.
[2016/02/02 15:08:24] <brmbrmcar> Oh yes.
[2016/02/02 15:08:44] <Hume2> I write some temporary notes on it and then i throw it away.
[2016/02/02 15:08:53] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:09:28] <brmbrmcar> I cheat those.
[2016/02/02 15:09:38] <brmbrmcar> Well, I did once.
[2016/02/02 15:09:57] <Hume2> it's strange, but I've never cheated.
[2016/02/02 15:10:32] <Hume2> I don't have "good" marks, but still good enoug to pass.
[2016/02/02 15:10:54] <brmbrmcar> Sometimes, even when it seems formal,there is a break in between taking the test.
[2016/02/02 15:11:19] <brmbrmcar> I just know how to take the advantages.
[2016/02/02 15:11:54] <Hume2> i never had a break in between taking the test.
[2016/02/02 15:12:10] <brmbrmcar> Well, that's my school.
[2016/02/02 15:12:16] <brmbrmcar> So informal.
[2016/02/02 15:12:39] <brmbrmcar> Except on pointless things.
[2016/02/02 15:12:49] <Hume2> That makes sense.
[2016/02/02 15:13:18] <Hume2> I hate how they torture us with ᑎ̲.
[2016/02/02 15:13:29] <brmbrmcar> What?
[2016/02/02 15:13:40] <brmbrmcar> Describe the symbol.
[2016/02/02 15:13:53] <Hume2> The same symbol again.
[2016/02/02 15:13:59] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2016/02/02 15:14:16] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:14:28] <brmbrmcar> What do you mean?
[2016/02/02 15:14:54] <Hume2> I mean the most of biology.
[2016/02/02 15:15:21] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2016/02/02 15:16:25] <Hume2> You know, recognizing what kind of organism is what.
[2016/02/02 15:17:01] <Hume2> I just want to know what is edible, that would be enough.
[2016/02/02 15:17:07] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:17:59] <brmbrmcar> It is soboring.
[2016/02/02 15:18:08] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/02 15:19:18] <brmbrmcar> I never got those cells things.
[2016/02/02 15:19:35] <brmbrmcar> I just messed it up.
[2016/02/02 15:19:41] <Hume2> It's useless for the most of students.
[2016/02/02 15:21:39] <brmbrmcar> Yes,
[2016/02/02 15:22:04] <brmbrmcar> Jusyt learnit later.
[2016/02/02 15:22:23] <Hume2> I wouldn't learn it even later :D
[2016/02/02 15:22:57] <Hume2> When I don't know, I just type something.
[2016/02/02 15:23:37] <Hume2> Question: Where lives <some kind of fish>?
[2016/02/02 15:23:47] <Hume2> Answer: In the water.
[2016/02/02 15:23:59] <brmbrmcar> Correct!
[2016/02/02 15:24:18] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 15:24:46] <brmbrmcar> Top of the class is Hume2, with 1 out of 1 correct!
[2016/02/02 15:24:52] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 15:25:13] <Hume2> Question: Can the biggest shark eat a human? And why?
[2016/02/02 15:25:27] <Hume2> Answer: Yes, I've seen it in TV.
[2016/02/02 15:25:39] <Hume2> It wans't correct though.
[2016/02/02 15:25:49] <brmbrmcar> I guess not.
[2016/02/02 15:25:52] <brmbrmcar> 1 mark.
[2016/02/02 15:25:59] <brmbrmcar> The why was wrog.
[2016/02/02 15:26:26] <Hume2> Those why questions are something annoying in biology.
[2016/02/02 15:26:44] <Hume2> Once I've answered: Because the god has made it that way.
[2016/02/02 15:26:50] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:27:27] <brmbrmcar> They are bad questions.
[2016/02/02 15:28:02] <Hume2> I heard that there was a cell and a rabit and question: Which of these have only one cell? And why?
[2016/02/02 15:28:34] <Hume2> He didn't know what to answer on that why, so I adviced him to answer:
[2016/02/02 15:28:41] <Hume2> It was once in TV.
[2016/02/02 15:28:45] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:29:37] <brmbrmcar> I currently keep being asked "Why do plants do photosynthesis?" GRRR
[2016/02/02 15:29:47] <brmbrmcar> For fu.
[2016/02/02 15:29:50] <brmbrmcar> n
[2016/02/02 15:29:52] <Hume2> Terrible question.
[2016/02/02 15:30:07] <brmbrmcar> Seems more likely.
[2016/02/02 15:30:58] <Hume2> I think that the teacher doesn't want to know why, but what it causes.
[2016/02/02 15:31:27] <brmbrmcar> Oxegen, glucose. Apparently.
[2016/02/02 15:31:48] <Hume2> Or isn't the answer: Because it contains cholophyle?
[2016/02/02 15:32:01] <Hume2> *chlorophyle or how it is.
[2016/02/02 15:32:10] <brmbrmcar> Yes, maybe.
[2016/02/02 15:32:16] <brmbrmcar> I don't know.
[2016/02/02 15:32:36] <Hume2> There are some questions those answers are illogical.
[2016/02/02 15:32:42] <brmbrmcar> Yes,
[2016/02/02 15:32:53] <Hume2> You just have to learn what answer belongs to which question.
[2016/02/02 15:33:14] <Hume2> Even when it doesn't make any sense.
[2016/02/02 15:33:24] <brmbrmcar> I always mess this up.
[2016/02/02 15:33:40] <Hume2> I mess this up too.
[2016/02/02 15:33:44] <brmbrmcar> THere is always a range of excuses why I got marked wrong.
[2016/02/02 15:33:46] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2016/02/02 15:34:28] <Hume2> Yes, even when the excuses don't make it any better.
[2016/02/02 15:34:52] <Hume2> Usually.
[2016/02/02 15:34:53] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:35:54] <brmbrmcar> And in the last test there was one seriously bad question.
[2016/02/02 15:36:14] <Hume2> go on
[2016/02/02 15:37:01] <brmbrmcar> THere was a radiator.
[2016/02/02 15:37:29] <brmbrmcar> It was rated lets say 6 kW (I can't remember)
[2016/02/02 15:37:54] <brmbrmcar> Energy costs 12p or whatever perkWh.
[2016/02/02 15:38:14] <brmbrmcar> How much does it cost for 12 hours?
[2016/02/02 15:38:31] <Hume2> Oh, these questions.
[2016/02/02 15:38:55] <brmbrmcar> Seems alright, but the answer was apparently 864 kWh.
[2016/02/02 15:39:08] <Hume2> LOL
[2016/02/02 15:39:10] <brmbrmcar> Ah, 862p.
[2016/02/02 15:39:14] <brmbrmcar> 864.
[2016/02/02 15:39:19] <brmbrmcar> Sorry.
[2016/02/02 15:39:28] <Hume2> That's weird.
[2016/02/02 15:39:30] <brmbrmcar> Irt still doesn't make sense
[2016/02/02 15:39:57] <Hume2> And 8 Pounds 64p was incorrect, I guess.
[2016/02/02 15:40:18] <brmbrmcar> THe answer would work if it was 6kWh rated, and it didn't say tat.
[2016/02/02 15:40:53] <brmbrmcar> I ened up with a crazy answer.
[2016/02/02 15:41:07] <Hume2> Yes, it's a crazy question.
[2016/02/02 15:42:01] <brmbrmcar> And they give out these books with even crazier stuff.
[2016/02/02 15:42:16] <Hume2> Yeah, no wonder.
[2016/02/02 15:43:18] <brmbrmcar> They cost money!
[2016/02/02 15:43:54] <Hume2> Yes, but the content is almost the same as in the older books.
[2016/02/02 15:44:43] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:44:55] <brmbrmcar> JUst updated for the new test things.
[2016/02/02 15:45:26] <Hume2> That makes sense, because it changes frequently.
[2016/02/02 15:46:16] <Hume2> I'm not even talking about that it's somewere in the Internet, bazilion times.
[2016/02/02 15:46:24] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:46:39] <brmbrmcar> I didn't want it.
[2016/02/02 15:47:03] <Hume2> Yes, but it's not possible to get rid of it.
[2016/02/02 15:47:25] <Hume2> Many people working at the press would lost their jobs.
[2016/02/02 15:47:43] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:47:57] <Hume2> This and many other reasons.
[2016/02/02 15:48:29] <brmbrmcar> I hate when they make you pau for these things.
[2016/02/02 15:48:49] <Hume2> I hate that too.
[2016/02/02 15:48:57] <brmbrmcar> It's a stste school!
[2016/02/02 15:49:22] <Hume2> They could just tell the links where to get that info for free.
[2016/02/02 15:49:54] <brmbrmcar> And in art, you have to splash out the equivalent of around ?2.00 on a terrible scrap book.
[2016/02/02 15:50:03] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:50:08] <brmbrmcar> They should!
[2016/02/02 15:50:18] <brmbrmcar> Or, photocopy it. :D
[2016/02/02 15:50:38] <Hume2> :D However, you know, all those officiers losing their jobs.
[2016/02/02 15:51:12] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:51:17] <brmbrmcar> Jobs.

[2016/02/02 15:51:37] <Hume2> You know, all the army of officiers.
[2016/02/02 15:51:58] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:52:13] <brmbrmcar> They need jobs, I do guess.
[2016/02/02 15:52:30] <Hume2> Indeed. And they are willing to fight.
[2016/02/02 15:53:11] * brmbrmcar is scared
[2016/02/02 15:53:16] <brmbrmcar> THey really?
[2016/02/02 15:53:37] <Hume2> No, like law-fighting.
[2016/02/02 15:53:57] <Hume2> They will find something that you did wrong and blame you.
[2016/02/02 15:54:16] <brmbrmcar> That scares me.
[2016/02/02 15:54:24] <brmbrmcar> Court?
[2016/02/02 15:54:29] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:54:57] <Hume2> They also have money, so they pay someone to make you trouble.
[2016/02/02 15:55:15] <brmbrmcar> I hate the idea of court.
[2016/02/02 15:55:29] <brmbrmcar> Several hours, trying to defend yourself.
[2016/02/02 15:55:48] <Hume2> I was never at it, so I can't say.
[2016/02/02 15:56:14] <brmbrmcar> I haven't either.
[2016/02/02 15:56:56] <Hume2> Also when the office is big enough, its productivity is more like zero.
[2016/02/02 15:57:19] <Tobbi> great, no space left on device (again)
[2016/02/02 15:57:26] <Hume2> Because the officiers solve mainly the problem of the office itself.
[2016/02/02 15:57:48] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:57:53] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 15:59:09] <Hume2> In the worst case it also damages the stuff arround.
[2016/02/02 16:00:01] <brmbrmcar> Like what?
[2016/02/02 16:00:46] <Hume2> I mean that the activity they think that is good, is bad for most people.
[2016/02/02 16:01:10] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2016/02/02 16:01:21] <brmbrmcar> I agree.
[2016/02/02 16:02:40] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Want to teach me how to code an android app? :p
[2016/02/02 16:02:48] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: No.
[2016/02/02 16:03:10] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Unless you want to program "Add-Ommmm" as an android app.
[2016/02/02 16:03:31] <sydney_untangle> lol.
[2016/02/02 16:03:46] <Hume2> Add-Ommmm :D
[2016/02/02 16:06:34] <brmbrmcar> What is Add-0mmmm?
[2016/02/02 16:09:40] <sydney_untangle> brmbrmcar: A app you can code for me.
[2016/02/02 16:09:40] <Tobbi> You guys don't want to know.
[2016/02/02 16:10:15] <Tobbi> Hume2, brmbrmcar, sydney_untangle: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/addommmm/?src=search
[2016/02/02 16:11:23] <Hume2> :D I'll try it.
[2016/02/02 16:11:30] <Tobbi> Hume2: Doesn't work on recent firefox versions.
[2016/02/02 16:11:36] <Tobbi> I should update it.
[2016/02/02 16:12:12] <Hume2> That's a shame.
[2016/02/02 16:12:44] <Tobbi> Hume2: If you want, study the code and update it. It should be on my github.
[2016/02/02 16:13:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: https://github.com/tobbi/AddOmmmm
[2016/02/02 16:14:29] <Hume2> It was quite fast to make it, wasn't it?
[2016/02/02 16:14:37] <Tobbi> Hume2: I don't remember.
[2016/02/02 16:14:42] <Tobbi> I was just doing this for the fun value of it.
[2016/02/02 16:14:54] <Hume2> I see.
[2016/02/02 16:15:40] <brmbrmcar> Is it any good?
[2016/02/02 16:15:46] <brmbrmcar> s/Is/Was/
[2016/02/02 16:15:46] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "Was it any good?"
[2016/02/02 16:15:58] <Hume2> It's good for school computers :D
[2016/02/02 16:16:08] <Tobbi> Hume2: you got it! :D
[2016/02/02 16:18:53] <brmbrmcar> I don't get it.
[2016/02/02 16:19:15] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What don't you get?
[2016/02/02 16:20:47] <brmbrmcar> A horse making noise with the picture.
[2016/02/02 16:21:06] <brmbrmcar> Is the horse eating the food.
[2016/02/02 16:21:08] <brmbrmcar> ?
[2016/02/02 16:21:25] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: *sigh* I should really update the source.
[2016/02/02 16:23:59] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2016/02/02 16:24:29] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: No, I think. I think that the horse doesn't display anyway.
[2016/02/02 16:24:57] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar, Hume2: It's only the lasagna that shows. And while showing it, you can hear a horse sound.
[2016/02/02 16:25:24] <Hume2> I thought so.
[2016/02/02 16:26:27] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 16:26:40] <brmbrmcar> I thoughr so too.
[2016/02/02 16:28:27] <sydney_untangle> Cool! https://openrct2.org/
[2016/02/02 16:28:51] <Tobbi> I never played that.
[2016/02/02 16:30:22] <Hume2> Ever notet that the word "sign" is similar to "sigh"?
[2016/02/02 16:31:19] <Tobbi> Hume2: No, I didn't.
[2016/02/02 16:33:51] <Hume2> I'll go to bed, bye!

[2016/02/03 07:15:38] <MCMic> Hello, can you tell me what is the windows equivalent for folder «~/.supertux/» ?
[2016/02/03 07:15:54] <MCMic> I meant «~/.supertux2/»
[2016/02/03 07:16:00] <Hume2> It should be %appdata%/.supertux2
[2016/02/03 07:16:24] <MCMic> hum, and %appdata% is something people can find easily?
[2016/02/03 07:16:54] <Hume2> I guess you can just type it to the Windows explorer and it opens.
[2016/02/03 07:17:02] <MCMic> ok
[2016/02/03 07:17:30] <MCMic> Thanks
[2016/02/03 07:18:02] <MCMic> I’m speedrunning supertux and needed to explain people how to get a fresh profile: http://www.speedrun.com/SuperTux/guide/n1uyf

[2016/02/03 10:53:04] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: And i don't really want to learn how to code...
[2016/02/03 10:53:38] <sydney_untangle> I didn't realize that Android programs are Java. o_O
[2016/02/03 10:53:42] <Tobbi> k
[2016/02/03 10:59:35] <brmbrmcar> Java is evil.
[2016/02/03 11:00:54] <sydney_untangle> brmbrmcar: Oracle Java is evil.
[2016/02/03 11:03:13] <mt> you can also use non-Java code on android
[2016/02/03 11:03:14] <mt> https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html
[2016/02/03 11:07:29] <Tobbi> mt: I tell you: Just: Don't! NDK reminds me of my project. I don't want to be remembered.
[2016/02/03 11:08:06] <Tobbi> Also, sydney_untangle: What's wrong with Java?
[2016/02/03 11:09:05] <mt> Java is just full of security problems
[2016/02/03 11:09:55] <brmbrmcar> sydney_untangle: What's the difference?
[2016/02/03 11:11:13] <sydney_untangle> Well, security holes, and the installer provided by oracle likes to install junkware IE bars on grandparents computers...
[2016/02/03 11:12:11] <brmbrmcar> grandparents computers = bad security
[2016/02/03 11:12:26] <brmbrmcar> Oracle knoes that well.
[2016/02/03 11:14:35] <brmbrmcar> Do they give back data to gain that?

[2016/02/03 12:04:12] <Hume2> It's yeallow.
[2016/02/03 12:04:24] <brmbrmcar> Good.

[2016/02/03 12:05:03] <Hume2> OK
[2016/02/03 12:05:24] <mt> brmbrmcar: please don't

[2016/02/03 12:05:47] <mt> abuse colors
[2016/02/03 12:05:56] <brmbrmcar> I won't.
[2016/02/03 12:06:02] <brmbrmcar> I tested it.
[2016/02/03 12:06:03] <mt> you did
[2016/02/03 12:06:27] <brmbrmcar> I know!
[2016/02/03 12:06:35] <mt> that wasn't testing, since -c is actually -c; if that wouldn't work it would've been discovered before
[2016/02/03 12:06:48] <mt> you did abuse it, that's what I was referring to
[2016/02/03 12:06:48] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2016/02/03 12:07:08] <mt> consider that as a warning
[2016/02/03 12:07:15] <brmbrmcar> I checked it for reasons of wierdness.

[2016/02/03 12:23:20] <sistemx> Hello, I want ask, if I can use sound and sprites and characters ets to my game. I am beginer and I don't undestand licence fully. Do sombody know?
[2016/02/03 12:29:43] <mt> the best thing you can do is consulting a lawyer
[2016/02/03 12:30:58] <Hume2> Yes, but don't ask two lawyers, because you wouldn't get the same thing :D
[2016/02/03 12:32:34] <Hume2> In short, you can use it even without asking, but uder some kind of termas. I don't remember it much.
[2016/02/03 12:33:21] <mt> most would fall under https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-%28gpl-3%29 or https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/
[2016/02/03 12:33:38] <Hume2> I don't know about the other, but I wouldn't blame you even if you used it incorrectly.
[2016/02/03 12:33:59] <mt> note that these simplifications are just for easier understanding
[2016/02/03 12:34:28] <mt> for the full legal implications, consult with a lawyer and ask them about the actual license content
[2016/02/03 12:35:50] <sistemx> I am talking about supertux
[2016/02/03 12:36:00] <mt> yes
[2016/02/03 12:36:21] <mt> most of supertux would fall under the licenses mentioned
[2016/02/03 12:36:25] <sistemx> I see, so it is not easy as I  thought :(
[2016/02/03 12:36:58] <Hume2> If you want to make some profit, then it's not easy.
[2016/02/03 12:37:19] <sistemx> I   thought, if some thing is "open source" you can use it as I can. But looks too difficult
[2016/02/03 12:37:48] <Hume2> Not really, there's some kind of law jungle arround it.
[2016/02/03 12:37:51] <sistemx> profit is not priority for me now, I am beginer and I want help to Ubuntu touch
[2016/02/03 12:38:05] <mt> it's still copyrighted and you've still got some restrictions
[2016/02/03 12:38:06] <sistemx> So I want make some games
[2016/02/03 12:38:15] <Hume2> Then you just mention the authors of the resources.
[2016/02/03 12:38:25] <Hume2> This should be enough, I hope.
[2016/02/03 12:39:10] <mt> I think even GPL and CC-BY-SA allow commercial redistribution in at least some cases, but DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A LAWYER
[2016/02/03 12:39:32] <Hume2> I am not a lawyer too.
[2016/02/03 12:39:40] <sistemx> So you mean that I will check contact from supertux web site and ask them? Or check names and ask directly to each person?
[2016/02/03 12:40:09] <Hume2> You don't have to ask, I hope.
[2016/02/03 12:40:22] <mt> you don't usually even need to ask, just put their name somewhere in your game (e.g. in the credits)
[2016/02/03 12:40:35] <mt> for most open source licenses
[2016/02/03 12:40:50] <sistemx> Something like this I read before
[2016/02/03 12:41:07] <mt> also, be sure to check the files included in the repos if a file you're going to use is not under the usual license
[2016/02/03 12:41:28] <sistemx> But I just worry, play with license is not fun :(
[2016/02/03 12:41:42] <mt> e.g. there's a soundtrack included in the game that we're only allowed to use due to permission from the original author
[2016/02/03 12:42:05] <sistemx> I see
[2016/02/03 12:42:21] <Hume2> Yes, the GPL says that it should be distributed under the same license.
[2016/02/03 12:42:31] <sistemx> So maybe better way find open source game from one owner
[2016/02/03 12:42:55] <sistemx> it is too complicate :)
[2016/02/03 12:42:56] <mt> most open source projects have multiple authors
[2016/02/03 12:42:58] <sistemx> :(
[2016/02/03 12:43:01] <mt> that's the entire point of it
[2016/02/03 12:43:20] <mt> also http://opengameart.org/ for more art (but check the license too)
[2016/02/03 12:43:37] <mt> oh and what's important to mention:
[2016/02/03 12:43:48] <Hume2> I think that this my mad response speaks for everything: https://github.com/SuperTux/addons/issues/9
[2016/02/03 12:44:04] <mt> we might be exaggerating about this
[2016/02/03 12:44:19] <mt> but we don't want to be liable for stuff you do
[2016/02/03 12:44:20] <sistemx> This site I know, But best is find all together. on this website I can not find all together..
[2016/02/03 12:45:37] <sistemx> Anyway, thanks for help..
[2016/02/03 12:45:45] <mt> Hume2: (that's still open)
[2016/02/03 12:45:54] <Hume2> damn
[2016/02/03 12:46:12] <Hume2> Anyway, do you know why I put there that response?
[2016/02/03 12:46:41] <mt> Hume2: (also in the level files you seem to have specified GPL 2+/CC-BY-SA 3.0 even if you don't care, so something public domain-ish would be appropriate)

[2016/02/03 12:47:05] <mt> if we don't specify in the source place
[2016/02/03 12:47:17] <mt> we'll have a problem when we want to move away from github oslt

[2016/02/03 12:47:57] <Hume2> I responsed like this because I wanted to know whether he really needs to know the license.
[2016/02/03 12:49:02] <Hume2> I knew that this was created just because he wanted to complain.

[2016/02/03 14:04:29] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/03 14:04:39] <Tobbi> Unless you look (or it makes this "ding" sound) the baby might or might not be alive.
[2016/02/03 14:06:09] <Hume2> If the baby was smaller than the wavelength, it would stay alive.

[2016/02/03 14:20:39] <Hume2> They cost only 59 CZK.
[2016/02/03 14:21:46] <Hume2> The price is excluding those wooden parts: http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/necyklopedie/images/6/61/Mezery_v_plotu.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091220130747
[2016/02/03 14:29:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: Surely the baby can observe itself? :D
[2016/02/03 14:29:41] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, the cat can observe itself as well.
[2016/02/03 14:30:07] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/03 14:30:12] <Hume2> Yes, but the wave fuction would collapse for us after we open the microwave.
[2016/02/03 14:30:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hmmm. I don't understand schrodinger's cat...
[2016/02/03 14:30:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's just about the person being outside not being able to observer.
[2016/02/03 14:30:30] <Tobbi> *observe
[2016/02/03 14:30:42] <Tobbi> Also, I forgot quite a lot about this anyway...
[2016/02/03 14:31:50] <Hume2> It's also hard to get it, I think.
[2016/02/03 14:32:25] <Hume2> And it's not much useful if you aren't going to construct quantum computers.
[2016/02/03 14:32:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: But surely whether the person can observe or not doesn't matter :D
[2016/02/03 14:33:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: But, you need an actual observer to make a finite decision about whether the baby is alive or not.
[2016/02/03 14:33:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: What about God :P :D
[2016/02/03 14:33:38] <Karkus> ?
[2016/02/03 14:34:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Way too philosophical for me.
[2016/02/03 14:34:10] <Hume2> Don't you think Chuck Norris?
[2016/02/03 14:34:13] <Hume2> :P
[2016/02/03 14:34:19] <Tobbi> Oh god... :D Well, he'd know...same for someone who'd observe the baby's cries vanish...
[2016/02/03 14:34:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's actually a physics analogy.
[2016/02/03 14:34:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is it something to do with Quantum Superpositions?
[2016/02/03 14:35:02] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes...exactly.
[2016/02/03 14:35:23] <Karkus> Tobbi: It certainly helps me to not understand them at all...
[2016/02/03 14:35:27] <Hume2> Some people are at superposition of two opinions.
[2016/02/03 14:35:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: I was bad at everything in high school.
[2016/02/03 14:35:57] <Tobbi> everything...no exceptions.
[2016/02/03 14:36:58] <Hume2> It doesn't matter. They teach just crap anyway.
[2016/02/03 14:37:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Nothing at all? Well, I guess with programming you found your place?
[2016/02/03 14:37:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, okay I was good at Philosophy and computer science.
[2016/02/03 14:37:37] <Tobbi> And I might've even been good at other subjects if I had been interested in them.
[2016/02/03 14:37:39] <Tobbi> But I wasn't.
[2016/02/03 14:37:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: You should've tried being interested at maths :D
[2016/02/03 14:38:27] <Tobbi> And no, with programming, I didn't find my place. This is just a temporary thing, I imagine.
[2016/02/03 14:38:34] <Tobbi> I want this to be just a temporary thing.
[2016/02/03 14:38:45] <Tobbi> The outlook of having to program my entire life makes me sad.
[2016/02/03 14:38:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: Fair enough.
[2016/02/03 14:39:01] <Tobbi> :)
[2016/02/03 14:39:35] <Hume2> I don't want to program my life as well. This scares me.
[2016/02/03 14:39:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: About flexlay
[2016/02/03 14:39:41] <Karkus> ~excuse
[2016/02/03 14:39:41] <red_bot> Karkus: It's not plugged in.
[2016/02/03 14:39:48] <Tobbi> Flexlay is not plugged in?
[2016/02/03 14:40:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, I'm trying to get a suitable excuse for not committing for a while...
[2016/02/03 14:40:21] <Tobbi> Karkus: oh, don't worry. Neither have I...
[2016/02/03 14:40:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I've been more busy than usual lately...
[2016/02/03 14:40:36] <Karkus> I will get round to it, soon as I can.
[2016/02/03 14:40:39] <Karkus> ~excuse
[2016/02/03 14:40:39] <red_bot> Karkus: routing problems on the neural net
[2016/02/03 14:40:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: Again, don't worry about it... I have been busy with stuff as well... college...
[2016/02/03 14:41:34] <Karkus> Tobbi, Hume2: Anyways, gtg afk now, bye :D
[2016/02/03 14:41:42] <Tobbi> See you.
[2016/02/03 14:41:49] <Hume2> Bye!
[2016/02/03 14:42:46] <Hume2> Narre has a special subject for numeric technologies.
[2016/02/03 14:43:31] <Hume2> He says that all students except him and one more, fail it properly.
[2016/02/03 14:44:20] <Hume2> And the tests are only transfering numbers from hexadecimary to binary, to decimal etc.
[2016/02/03 14:44:25] <Tobbi> The stuff we do in college is boooring...
[2016/02/03 14:44:39] <Tobbi> And by boring I mean: I cannot just think fastly...
[2016/02/03 14:44:50] <Tobbi> *fast
[2016/02/03 14:44:57] <Hume2> That makes sense.
[2016/02/03 14:45:07] <Tobbi> Hume2: Really or are you kidding me?
[2016/02/03 14:45:17] <Hume2> The most of the request use to be think something fast.
[2016/02/03 14:45:22] <Hume2> I know that.
[2016/02/03 14:45:36] <Tobbi> I really have a problem with long tasks where you don't get somewhere...
[2016/02/03 14:45:44] <Hume2> I too.
[2016/02/03 14:45:59] <Hume2> It gets boring.
[2016/02/03 14:46:12] <Tobbi> Hume2: But maybe that's not a special thing...
[2016/02/03 14:46:33] <Tobbi> Not sure if faster pace is really what I want...
[2016/02/03 14:47:03] <Hume2> I think speed is not as useful as the results.
[2016/02/03 14:47:27] <Tobbi> I know...
[2016/02/03 14:49:06] <Hume2> I liked maths, but it started to bore me, because it starts to be the same all the time.
[2016/02/03 14:49:37] <Hume2> Well, there is a difference between maths and school maths.
[2016/02/03 14:51:05] <Hume2> The teachers accidentally sometimes learn also something from the maths, but that's not important for getting a good mark from test.
[2016/02/03 14:52:48] <Tobbi> Hume2: School is crap. :P
[2016/02/03 14:52:54] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/03 14:53:01] <Tobbi> Who needs school, if I want I could rule the world. :D
[2016/02/03 14:53:19] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/03 14:55:16] <Hume2> Do you know, how hard is it now?
[2016/02/03 14:55:42] <Hume2> First you must wait for a bad economic situation and think a way how to solve it.
[2016/02/03 14:55:49] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/03 14:57:03] <Tobbi> ohrm.
[2016/02/03 14:57:05] <Tobbi> hrm
[2016/02/03 14:58:06] <Hume2> And then you just anschluss the states arround and hope that you win :DDDDD
[2016/02/03 15:00:28] <Tobbi> anschluss?
[2016/02/03 15:00:31] <Tobbi> connection?
[2016/02/03 15:00:50] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/03 15:02:02] <Hume2> In Czech we have a special word for connecting Austria to Germany, "anšlusovat".

[2016/02/03 18:27:56] <sydney_untangle> have you*
[2016/02/03 18:28:32] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Not much. I watched videos of "The Hoax Hotel" (scamming scammers). And I just watched a short clip from Pulp Fiction.
[2016/02/03 18:29:25] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Hrm.
[2016/02/03 18:29:34] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Do you know Pulp Fiction?
[2016/02/03 18:29:44] <Tobbi> actually, how old are you?
[2016/02/03 18:30:27] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: 16.
[2016/02/03 18:30:30] <sydney_untangle> No i don't.
[2016/02/03 18:30:56] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Okay, you would be allowed to watch it...
[2016/02/03 18:30:58] <Tobbi> but, nah.
[2016/02/03 18:31:15] <Tobbi> But you can read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction
[2016/02/03 18:32:13] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Eh, i think i will skip.
[2016/02/03 18:32:19] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/02/03 18:35:18] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Watch some pink panther instead...
[2016/02/03 18:35:28] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Not at the moment...
[2016/02/03 18:35:46] <sydney_untangle> Heh. :)
[2016/02/03 18:46:23] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: You just reminded me: I let Microsoft Sam read out this PDF some time ago: http://www.catholiclabor.org/gen-art/cafod-computers.pdf
[2016/02/03 18:46:42] <Tobbi> I still remember it saying "Clean up your computer - Working conditions in the electronic sector"

[2016/02/04 10:09:38] <Tobbi> Okay, what I did was not good.
[2016/02/04 10:09:48] <Tobbi> Force-pushing tinygettext because I tried to integrate upstream changes.
[2016/02/04 10:09:49] <Tobbi> gargh
[2016/02/04 10:10:20] <Tobbi> Should've done a branch instead.

[2016/02/04 11:12:06] <mt> ewww
[2016/02/04 11:12:18] <mt> could you *please* test things in a *test* branch
[2016/02/04 11:13:12] <Tobbi> mt: I have an upstream branch now, which is the test branch.
[2016/02/04 11:13:32] <Tobbi> mt: And, yes, I did manage to restore things to normal and enable branch protection...
[2016/02/04 11:13:41] <Tobbi> for that tinygettext master branch.
[2016/02/04 11:13:58] <mt> I'm talking about the supertux master branch
[2016/02/04 11:14:08] <mt> You shouldn't abuse it as a sandbox to play with
[2016/02/04 11:14:19] <Tobbi> mt: I did test things locally, not knowing that it doesn't fetch the tinygettext source from a different directory.
[2016/02/04 11:14:25] <mt> Because in master, history shouldn't be rewritten
[2016/02/04 11:14:41] <Tobbi> mt: So, I thought it fetches the source from external/tinygettext, but it doesn't...
[2016/02/04 11:14:51] <Tobbi> It creates a different directory, and reuses the source.
[2016/02/04 11:15:03] <Tobbi> And, yes, I am sorry about this.

[2016/02/04 12:01:29] <Tobbi> Okay, I am out of ideas for that appveyor build.
[2016/02/04 12:01:37] <Tobbi> But at least we're now at the latest upstream.
[2016/02/04 12:03:29] <Tobbi> mt, sydney_untangle, Karkus: What do you guys think about having symbols for levelset / worldmap in the game instead of writing it in the add-ons manager?
[2016/02/04 12:03:42] <Tobbi> That way, the list takes up way less space than before.
[2016/02/04 12:03:59] <Tobbi> If we have an icon there...
[2016/02/04 12:04:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: Symbols?
[2016/02/04 12:04:12] <mt> if we have TTF
[2016/02/04 12:04:20] <mt> we could easily add that as character
[2016/02/04 12:04:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: For example: You have one symbol for levelset, I don't know, make something up, and one symbol for worldmap.
[2016/02/04 12:04:45] <Tobbi> Yup, but adding an icon shouldn't be too difficult.
[2016/02/04 12:05:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: That way you know which is which? Sounds good
[2016/02/04 12:06:28] <Tobbi> Karkus: Exactly.

[2016/02/04 14:10:14] <Karkus> Hume2: I guess worldmap could be a small island, and levelset a list?
[2016/02/04 14:10:22] <Karkus> icon of a list
[2016/02/04 14:10:33] <Hume2> Icon of a list, hmmm...
[2016/02/04 14:11:18] <Hume2> A moment...
[2016/02/04 14:12:19] <Hume2> Karkus: Currently we have only worlds.
[2016/02/04 14:12:31] <Karkus> Hume2: test levels?
[2016/02/04 14:13:06] <Hume2> So are we speking about addon manager or about  contrib level menu?
[2016/02/04 14:14:32] <Karkus> Idk it was Tobbi's idea. I guess probably addon manager in which case you are correct
[2016/02/04 14:15:16] <Hume2> Karkus: So currently we have only worldmap addons.
[2016/02/04 14:15:37] <Karkus> Hume2: Then maybe this isn't needed?
[2016/02/04 14:15:47] <Hume2> And I think we should also start considering the quality of the new addons.
[2016/02/04 14:16:09] <Hume2> That way we won't have any levelsets among addons.
[2016/02/04 14:16:35] <Karkus> Hume2: Do you think it would be possible to add the ability to specify a level directory, and the levels appear? e.g. supertux2 ~
[2016/02/04 14:17:09] <Hume2> I'm not sure what are you talking about.
[2016/02/04 14:17:24] <Hume2> Don't you mean supertux2/levels ?
[2016/02/04 14:18:37] <Hume2> Karkus: also: The good levels from levelsets could be included in bonus islands.
[2016/02/04 14:19:39] <Karkus> Hume2: It's an idea. You specify a directory, instead of a single level, and the .stl & .stwm files are displayed so you can play them
[2016/02/04 14:19:57] <Karkus> Hume2: I think we have way too many levels in the bonus islands tbh
[2016/02/04 14:20:09] <Hume2> Karkus: got what you mean.
[2016/02/04 14:21:11] <Hume2> Anything < 30 levels is just a little thingy :D

[2016/02/05 09:23:09] <Tobbi> Hello maths22 (?)
[2016/02/05 09:24:25] <mt> it's an unstable connection
[2016/02/05 09:25:14] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2016/02/05 09:25:31] <mt> I actually have this useful feature in my script
[2016/02/05 09:25:52] <mt> if I ban-forward someone to ##fix-your-connection
[2016/02/05 09:26:09] <mt> it will/should automatically unban that after some (12?) hours
[2016/02/05 09:26:56] <mt> s/##fix-your-connection/##fix_your_connection/
[2016/02/05 09:26:56] <red_bot> mt: You did something wrong... Try s/you/me/ or tell me "help sed"
[2016/02/05 09:27:02] @ Quit: maths22: Ping timeout: 276 seconds
[2016/02/05 09:29:16] <Tobbi> Didn't know that existed.
[2016/02/05 09:29:35] <Tobbi> mt: How do you ban-forward guys anyway?
[2016/02/05 09:29:48] <mt> magic
[2016/02/05 09:30:08] <Tobbi> mt: You're not capable of using humor, so stop trying.
[2016/02/05 09:30:51] <mt> /mode #channel1 +b $a:Tobbi$#channel2
[2016/02/05 09:31:15] <mt> or globally, matching all bans, invites, etc...: /mode #channel1 +f #channel2
[2016/02/05 09:31:26] <Tobbi> Ah, nice
[2016/02/05 09:31:29] <Tobbi> I will note that.
[2016/02/05 09:31:38] <mt> per-ban forwards have a higher priority than +f
[2016/02/05 09:32:37] <mt> obligatory-alias-usage: please have a look at https://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml to see what modes do on freenode

[2016/02/05 10:12:57] <sydney_untangle> It's just suprising how serious she is taking it...
[2016/02/05 10:17:43] <mt> sydney_untangle: why are you highlighting me?

[2016/02/06 03:06:35] <mcmic> Hello
[2016/02/06 03:07:00] <mcmic> The wiki is still saying «newest version:SuperTux 0.3.5 (Changelog) »
[2016/02/06 03:14:59] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki is the wiki you want
[2016/02/06 03:16:35] <mt> the old wiki's history has been imported to https://github.com/SuperTux/wiki/tree/mediawiki and will hopefully be converted to be Gollum-compatible and merged with the current Gollum wiki
[2016/02/06 03:23:17] <mcmic> hum ok
[2016/02/06 03:23:31] <mcmic> It should be more clear on the old wiki that it’s obsolete
[2016/02/06 03:24:55] <mt> open an issue on github
[2016/02/06 03:25:16] <mt> that will annoy all the responsible people via email
[2016/02/06 03:38:09] <mcmic> ^^

[2016/02/07 08:35:24] <Hume2> mt: I think we should consider two discussion-needed issues.
[2016/02/07 08:35:47] <Hume2> #258 and #319.
[2016/02/07 08:36:36] <mt> what's to be discussed at https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/319?
[2016/02/07 08:37:17] <Hume2> I guess just whether it's an issue or not.
[2016/02/07 08:37:27] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/258 - sho8uld be oriented more at the colors of the current hats
[2016/02/07 08:37:51] <Hume2> How do you think that?
[2016/02/07 08:38:15] <mt> well, just use approximately the same color as in the actual hat
[2016/02/07 08:38:39] <Hume2> Yes, that would make sense.
[2016/02/07 08:38:58] <Hume2> So it's a needs-work then.
[2016/02/07 08:39:28] <mt> oh and I'd like .xfc, .psd, .kra or some other kind of source file
[2016/02/07 08:39:49] <mt> want to comment or should I do that?
[2016/02/07 08:39:57] <Hume2> OK, I'll response on it.
[2016/02/07 08:40:47] <mt> btw
[2016/02/07 08:40:56] <mt> did we ever consider GSoC?
[2016/02/07 08:41:02] <pentagon> [10supertux] 07Hume2 commented on issue 09#258: Ice, air and earth Christmas hats 13https://git.io/vRAYt
[2016/02/07 08:41:11] <Hume2> What is GSoc?
[2016/02/07 08:41:25] <mt> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code
[2016/02/07 08:41:47] * Hume2 is reading that
[2016/02/07 08:42:17] <mt> The STK folks participated in that, and I think there were quite a few contributors
[2016/02/07 08:44:41] <Hume2> Well, contest are always won by someone else. :D
[2016/02/07 08:44:53] <mt> what?
[2016/02/07 08:45:03] <Hume2> Win that kind of contest is quite hard, you know.
[2016/02/07 08:45:37] <Hume2> If we want to win that, we should get who sponsors it first.
[2016/02/07 08:45:37] <mt> you mean getting the project accepted?
[2016/02/07 08:45:51] <Hume2> Yes, I guess.
[2016/02/07 08:46:10] <Hume2> Or get a good position.
[2016/02/07 08:46:15] <mt> Well, it's not really about winning I think
[2016/02/07 08:46:31] <Hume2> hmmm…
[2016/02/07 08:46:31] <mt> It's more, you get your project accepted
[2016/02/07 08:46:40] <mt> Look for students you can mentor
[2016/02/07 08:46:58] <Hume2> I didn't read it whole.
[2016/02/07 08:47:02] <mt> They'll write you an application and you decide who you'd consider mentoring
[2016/02/07 08:47:14] <mt> Google then says 'you get to mentor x people'
[2016/02/07 08:47:21] <mt> And they'll code for you
[2016/02/07 08:47:29] <mt> or whatever
[2016/02/07 08:47:38] <Hume2> Well…
[2016/02/07 08:48:26] <mt> ping leyyin - do you want to tell us more about GSoC?
[2016/02/07 08:52:23] <mt> Hume2: hmm
[2016/02/07 08:52:31] <mt> it would be something to consider fast
[2016/02/07 08:52:38] <Hume2> mt: I didn't get it.
[2016/02/07 08:52:44] <mt> since the mentor organization application window starts tomorrow
[2016/02/07 08:52:52] <mt> it's open until February 19th
[2016/02/07 08:53:01] <Hume2> So do we have to be on the top positions to get some mentors?
[2016/02/07 08:53:04] <mt> https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/
[2016/02/07 08:53:15] <mt> nah, the mentors would be us
[2016/02/07 08:53:30] <Hume2> ah
[2016/02/07 08:53:46] <mt> https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/
[2016/02/07 08:54:05] <Hume2> LOL, translation error:      Domovská stránka Resources History Rules
[2016/02/07 08:55:31] <mt> pentagon: later tell Tobbi hi, we should consider participating as GSoC mentor organization - https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/ (we'd have to decide fast, organizations can apply from 2016-02-08 to 2016-02-19)
[2016/02/07 08:55:31] <pentagon> mt: The operation succeeded.
[2016/02/07 08:57:16] <Hume2> I'm getting lost.
[2016/02/07 08:57:21] <mt> why?
[2016/02/07 08:57:58] <Hume2> I can't get it. So we will tech some studetnst to program SuperTux and they will program it? Or what?
[2016/02/07 08:58:39] <mt> we will mentor computer science students - explain the SuperTux's codebase, and yes they can code some features
[2016/02/07 08:58:52] <mt> and Google pays them
[2016/02/07 08:59:18] <mt> https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq
[2016/02/07 09:01:52] <Hume2> I start getting it…
[2016/02/07 09:05:35] <leyyin> mt, what do you want to know?
[2016/02/07 09:05:42] <mt> everything
[2016/02/07 09:05:45] <leyyin> pff
[2016/02/07 09:05:49] <leyyin> kinda vague
[2016/02/07 09:06:22] <leyyin> the website or wikipedia explains it better imho
[2016/02/07 09:06:31] <leyyin> if you have specific questions
[2016/02/07 09:07:06] <mt> did STK have any specific goals before the mentor organization application?
[2016/02/07 09:07:12] <leyyin> yes
[2016/02/07 09:07:25] <mt> do you need them at that time?
[2016/02/07 09:07:31] <leyyin> they have some ideas
[2016/02/07 09:07:32] <Hume2> Imagine Tobbi as a mentor :D

[2016/02/07 09:08:44] <leyyin> when students apply it would be nice to have the ideas there
[2016/02/07 09:09:00] <leyyin> some general ideas of projects they can do
[2016/02/07 09:09:07] <mt> what would mentors do exactly? Answer the student's questions?
[2016/02/07 09:09:28] <leyyin> mentor him, show him when he is stuck
[2016/02/07 09:09:34] <leyyin> answer questions, etc
[2016/02/07 09:09:48] <Hume2> And say words beginning on * and ending on * :D
[2016/02/07 09:10:12] @ irungentoo joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/07 09:10:18] <Hume2> Yeah, I should stop.
[2016/02/07 09:10:36] <leyyin> Tobbi, you are a mentor, congrats
[2016/02/07 09:10:44] <Tobbi> leyyin: WHAT?
[2016/02/07 09:10:45] <pentagon> Tobbi: Sent 15 minutes ago: <mt> hi, we should consider participating as GSoC mentor organization - https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/ (we'd have to decide fast, organizations can apply from 2016-02-08 to 2016-02-19)
[2016/02/07 09:10:51] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2016/02/07 09:11:05] <Tobbi> Something tells me there's gonna be a lot of scrollback.
[2016/02/07 09:11:12] <Tobbi> leyyin: Problem is: As a mentor, I cannot get money, can I?
[2016/02/07 09:11:41] <Tobbi> Hume2: Oh, yes, and saying *sigh* is one of the key features of being a mentor
[2016/02/07 09:11:49] <Tobbi> Finally I can say that without fear of retribution.
[2016/02/07 09:11:55] <leyyin> you get 500$
[2016/02/07 09:12:02] <Tobbi> leyyin: As a mentor, I do?
[2016/02/07 09:12:05] <leyyin> yes
[2016/02/07 09:12:12] <Tobbi> mt: Apply immediately!
[2016/02/07 09:12:13] <leyyin> or hmm, the organization
[2016/02/07 09:12:16] <leyyin> which is you :D
[2016/02/07 09:12:22] <Tobbi> leyyin: My point exactly.
[2016/02/07 09:12:25] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/02/07 09:12:29] <Hume2> And do I have to provide my personal info to get the money?
[2016/02/07 09:12:33] <mt> Tobbi: we can't until tomorrow
[2016/02/07 09:12:36] <Tobbi> Hume2: You?
[2016/02/07 09:12:44] <Tobbi> Why would you be getting any money? :D
[2016/02/07 09:12:52] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/07 09:13:16] <mt> 500 USD/$number_of_mentors
[2016/02/07 09:13:40] <Hume2> What about this, Tobbi: You'll be the official mentor and I'll be mentoring :D
[2016/02/07 09:13:51] <Tobbi> Hume2: Meaning, I'll get the money? :D
[2016/02/07 09:13:56] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/07 09:13:56] <Tobbi> damn this.
[2016/02/07 09:14:03] <Tobbi> actually, that's not fair.
[2016/02/07 09:14:09] <Tobbi> Hume2: We can split evenly, if you want
[2016/02/07 09:15:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: I know I often joke about getting money to pay for various things in my life, but honestly, I would probably not feel happy with keeping the money...
[2016/02/07 09:15:32] <Hume2> I thought so.
[2016/02/07 09:15:36] <mt> "* Mentors should expect to spend at least 10 hours a week for each student."
[2016/02/07 09:15:52] <mt> (http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsoc-mentoring/about-this-manual/)
[2016/02/07 09:16:07] <Tobbi> That sounds good. I can do that...
[2016/02/07 09:16:12] <Tobbi> I spend 10 hours a week anyway.
[2016/02/07 09:16:24] <Tobbi> Actually, be back in a bit getting something to eat.
[2016/02/07 09:17:02] <pentagon> [10supertux] 07brmbrmcar commented on issue 09#258: Ice, air and earth Christmas hats 13https://git.io/vRAYt
[2016/02/07 09:17:04] <mt> Yeah, we're probably even having more than 10 hours a week discussing silly topics in here
[2016/02/07 09:17:13] <mt> Would be nice to fill that with something useful
[2016/02/07 09:17:22] <leyyin> like politics
[2016/02/07 09:17:23] * leyyin runs
[2016/02/07 09:17:46] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/07 09:18:23] <Tobbi> leyyin: Who do you want to win the presidential elections? :P
[2016/02/07 09:19:16] <mt> that's off-topic and since there's an on-topic discussion right now this discussion shouldn't take place in here :D
[2016/02/07 09:19:35] <leyyin> mt, kick me then :P
[2016/02/07 09:19:42] <mt> so, I could probably be a "backup mentor"
[2016/02/07 09:19:49] <Hume2> OK, do they need any personal info?
[2016/02/07 09:19:52] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/07 09:20:09] <leyyin> Hume2, your blood type
[2016/02/07 09:20:10] <mt> Hume2: google already has that anyway :D
[2016/02/07 09:20:24] <Hume2> mt: No, they don't :P
[2016/02/07 09:20:33] <leyyin> Tobbi, Donald Trump, so that I can watch the world burn
[2016/02/07 09:20:36] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/07 09:20:38] <Tobbi> leyyin: Great.

[2016/02/07 09:21:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: Also, blood type is actually pretty important in case you keep hitting your head against your desk and get a head wound and lose blood...
[2016/02/07 09:21:18] <leyyin> or you are a vampire and need food
[2016/02/07 09:21:35] <mt> Hume2: why not "Hume the Second"
[2016/02/07 09:21:49] <Hume2> mt: Because TeraTux was first.
[2016/02/07 09:21:56] <Tobbi> I'm Hume, the second I am, HUme the second, I am I am, I got married to the widow next door.
[2016/02/07 09:22:01] <Tobbi> She's been married 7 times before.
[2016/02/07 09:22:05] <Hume2> Yes and I'm 116 years old on Google :D
[2016/02/07 09:22:28] <leyyin> Hume2, believe me, google know everything about you
[2016/02/07 09:22:43] <Hume2> Hmmm…
[2016/02/07 09:23:08] <Hume2> Maybe the IP-detect? crap
[2016/02/07 09:23:17] <mt> oh right, some STK GSoC students work(ed) at Google, so you know that
[2016/02/07 09:23:30] <Tobbi> leyyin: Can you believe that I wanted to get a Doner yesterday at 11:40pm and they didn't have any?
[2016/02/07 09:23:43] <Tobbi> I was so furious...
[2016/02/07 09:23:47] <Tobbi> Well, actually, not really.
[2016/02/07 09:24:00] <leyyin> eating fast food at night
[2016/02/07 09:24:05] <leyyin> were you drunk?
[2016/02/07 09:24:13] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, just hungry.
[2016/02/07 09:24:18] <Tobbi> Also, döner is healthy fast food
[2016/02/07 09:24:25] <leyyin> " healthy fast food"
[2016/02/07 09:24:41] <Tobbi> leyyin: There's actual vegetables in there...
[2016/02/07 09:25:03] <Tobbi> So, the more vegetables, the healthier...
[2016/02/07 09:25:04] <leyyin> the salad at MC has 500 Kcal

[2016/02/07 09:25:39] <mt> guys
[2016/02/07 09:25:52] <mt> can we stop talking about $useless-thing
[2016/02/07 09:25:52] <Tobbi> mt: We concluded the GsoC talks, saying that we want to participate...
[2016/02/07 09:26:01] @ Mode -o mt by mt
[2016/02/07 09:26:03] <mt> okay
[2016/02/07 09:26:21] <mt> so, we'll look into what's required for applying tomorrow?
[2016/02/07 09:26:24] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2016/02/07 09:26:34] <Hume2> The students choose between the projects freely, right?
[2016/02/07 09:26:36] <Tobbi> If they need a bank account, I will apply myself...
[2016/02/07 09:26:37] * sydney_untangle yawns...
[2016/02/07 09:26:45] <mt> we should also look at some issues we'd like to get done
[2016/02/07 09:26:45] <Tobbi> Good afternoon sydney_untangle
[2016/02/07 09:27:16] <Tobbi> mt: By the way: I don't think that dashes are allowed in variables, so $useless-thing is likely a useless thing.
[2016/02/07 09:27:41] <leyyin> Tobbi, did you try perl?
[2016/02/07 09:27:45] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: hola.
[2016/02/07 09:27:54] <leyyin> I am pretty sure perl is a monster and allows everything :D
[2016/02/07 09:27:56] <Tobbi> leyyin: I did try it once, and had a hangover for several years.
[2016/02/07 09:28:40] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: JS is a monster and allows everything as well, anyways, in websites...
[2016/02/07 09:28:49] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: JS is beautiful, perl isn't.
[2016/02/07 09:29:06] <mt> node.js <3
[2016/02/07 09:29:14] <Tobbi> Perl is the ugliest thing, right after <insert non-appropriate yo mamma joke here>
[2016/02/07 09:29:43] <Tobbi> I'll probably get a Döner now...or something else from the bakery...
[2016/02/07 09:29:54] <Tobbi> So, you can continue talking about on-topic things.
[2016/02/07 09:29:55] <mt> but heh, JS actually allows Unicode for variables
[2016/02/07 09:30:07] <Tobbi> var döner = {}
[2016/02/07 09:30:09] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/07 09:30:19] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/07 09:30:32] <mt> var döner = new Food('döner');
[2016/02/07 09:30:36] <leyyin> https://i.imgur.com/6Vuf2Ws.gifv
[2016/02/07 09:30:50] <Tobbi> lol.
[2016/02/07 09:31:17] <Tobbi> Guys, can we discuss what we're gonna let the GsoC students work on once I get back and am fed?
[2016/02/07 09:31:24] <mt> sure
[2016/02/07 09:31:30] <Tobbi> So, probably 30-45 minutes.
[2016/02/07 09:31:33] <Tobbi> See you later.
[2016/02/07 09:31:54] <Hume2> OK.
[2016/02/07 09:32:06] <Hume2> I think they could fix that AppVeyor error :D
[2016/02/07 09:32:21] <mt> in that time, sydney_untangle can read the log and tell us what he thinks about GSoC
[2016/02/07 09:33:15] <mt> AppVeyor is silly for some reason
[2016/02/07 09:33:54] <mt> it runs the test suite for my IRC library multiple times: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maxteufel/node-notreallyirc/build/11
[2016/02/07 09:34:43] <mt> (it says 153 tests passed, in reality it's just 31 tests)
[2016/02/07 09:35:00] <Hume2> So it's an AppVeyor's problem, OK.
[2016/02/07 09:36:13] <mt> nah
[2016/02/07 09:36:21] <mt> it's a windows problem, I guess
[2016/02/07 09:36:37] <Hume2> That's more likely.
[2016/02/07 09:37:38] <Hume2> Windows forces the computer to operate with ones, zeros and errors :D

[2016/02/07 10:41:45] <Hume2> Well, it was a bit more.
[2016/02/07 10:41:50] <Tobbi> No problem.
[2016/02/07 10:42:00] <Tobbi> Who wants to participate_
[2016/02/07 10:42:02] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/07 10:42:08] <Tobbi> I mean: In this discussion...
[2016/02/07 10:42:10] <Hume2> I told you to not wait for me.
[2016/02/07 10:42:13] <Hume2> OK
[2016/02/07 10:42:14] <Tobbi> I know.
[2016/02/07 10:43:27] <Hume2> So if anyone wants to be a mentor, then please don't behave like Bernd das Brot.
[2016/02/07 10:43:46] <Hume2> In that case tell someone else to do it instead.
[2016/02/07 10:44:23] <Tobbi> >D
[2016/02/07 10:44:24] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/07 10:44:41] <Tobbi> Hume2: You know Bernd das Brot? :D Was I the one who introduced you to that one?
[2016/02/07 10:44:49] <Hume2> Yes, indeed.
[2016/02/07 10:44:52] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/07 10:44:59] <Tobbi> I am not sure if I can mentor.
[2016/02/07 10:45:08] <Tobbi> I mean 1) I need to make the time commitment...
[2016/02/07 10:45:19] <Tobbi> and 2) Do I actually know enough about the code base?
[2016/02/07 10:45:27] <Hume2> I know that.
[2016/02/07 10:46:00] <Hume2> Therefore I suggest that we all could be mentors.
[2016/02/07 10:46:08] <Tobbi> Mentoring together might work, really.
[2016/02/07 10:46:30] <Hume2> Each mentor could be for another part of SuperTux.
[2016/02/07 10:46:47] <Tobbi> I suggest we should discuss what we want to achieve first
[2016/02/07 10:46:50] <Tobbi> And then we can see...
[2016/02/07 10:47:02] <Hume2> Yes, that'd be better.
[2016/02/07 10:47:12] <Tobbi> I would suggest we do a) 2-player mode.
[2016/02/07 10:47:18] <Tobbi> and b) maybe font engine improvements_
[2016/02/07 10:47:19] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/07 10:47:26] <Tobbi> right? wrong?
[2016/02/07 10:47:27] <Hume2> hmmm…
[2016/02/07 10:47:28] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/07 10:47:34] <Tobbi> mt: Sorry, meeting started.
[2016/02/07 10:47:37] <Tobbi> Ideas?
[2016/02/07 10:47:47] <Hume2> 2-player mode was postponed to 0.6.0, wasn't it?
[2016/02/07 10:48:10] <Hume2> Font improvements could be good.
[2016/02/07 10:49:12] <Tobbi> Hume2: I believe most of the things GSOC students can work on would be for 0.5.0 or 0.6.0.
[2016/02/07 10:49:23] <Tobbi> Hume2: We want the project to be interesting.
[2016/02/07 10:49:52] <Hume2> So we can start with 0.5.0 and then 0.6.0.
[2016/02/07 10:50:20] <Tobbi> I really am not sure which is which.
[2016/02/07 10:50:23] <Hume2> OK, so what's for 0.5.0?
[2016/02/07 10:50:28] <Tobbi> Just saying that we should consider bigger projects.
[2016/02/07 10:50:41] <Tobbi> It doesn't matter if one of them is scheduled for 0.6, because we can reschedule any time.
[2016/02/07 10:50:48] <Hume2> Editor ? :P
[2016/02/07 10:51:09] <Hume2> I didn't want to tell that on the first place.
[2016/02/07 10:51:09] <Tobbi> Hume2: Actually! Flexlay...
[2016/02/07 10:51:24] <Tobbi> That might be a fun project to work on...Problem is: Who mentors that?
[2016/02/07 10:51:35] <Hume2> Karkus, I hope.
[2016/02/07 10:51:44] <Tobbi> Hume2: Does he know enough about the editor?
[2016/02/07 10:51:50] <Tobbi> Also, can he make the time commitment?
[2016/02/07 10:51:56] <Tobbi> I doubt that.
[2016/02/07 10:52:03] <Hume2> I'm not sure.
[2016/02/07 10:52:28] <Hume2> I'd like to mentor the in-game editor or the game mechanism.
[2016/02/07 10:52:44] <Tobbi> Okay, in-game editor can be fun!!! :)

[2016/02/07 10:52:55] <Tobbi> That might be good project...also, that's self-contained.
[2016/02/07 10:52:58] <Tobbi> more or less.
[2016/02/07 10:54:06] <Hume2> The slope sliding could be good too.
[2016/02/07 10:54:30] <Tobbi> Slope sliding?
[2016/02/07 10:54:49] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Do you have anything to contribute?
[2016/02/07 10:55:00] <Hume2> It was decided that this will be implemented.
[2016/02/07 10:55:23] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Can you give me a rough overview of what we are talking about?
[2016/02/07 10:55:32] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Google summer of code.
[2016/02/07 10:55:38] <sydney_untangle> Oh.
[2016/02/07 10:55:49] <sydney_untangle> And what about it?
[2016/02/07 10:55:50] <Tobbi> Hume2: Oh, you mean the belly slide, right? :D
[2016/02/07 10:56:00] <Hume2> Tobbi: Yes, exactly.
[2016/02/07 10:56:06] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: We'd like to participate and wonder what projects the students can work on.
[2016/02/07 10:57:17] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/07 10:57:37] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Oh.
[2016/02/07 10:57:40] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Everything? :D
[2016/02/07 10:57:53] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Everything is not a good description to get people interested.
[2016/02/07 10:58:46] <sydney_untangle> Maybe that Puffin bird, tux swimming, tux belly diving? Not sure what else.
[2016/02/07 10:59:07] <Hume2> Just that.
[2016/02/07 10:59:18] <Hume2> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/292
[2016/02/07 10:59:24] <mt> re time commitment
[2016/02/07 10:59:26] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: So, we have talked about the font thing...migrating to freetype or sdl_ttf, 2-player thing...
[2016/02/07 10:59:34] <mt> we can always assign two mentors to one student
[2016/02/07 10:59:39] <Tobbi> oh, sure.
[2016/02/07 10:59:54] <sydney_untangle> two player would be cool, but i don' see the use of it for this game tbh.
[2016/02/07 11:00:06] <Tobbi> It's a much wanted feature...
[2016/02/07 11:00:19] <mt> sydney_untangle: have you seen multiplayer in the Wii (U) mario games?
[2016/02/07 11:00:35] <mt> it would work
[2016/02/07 11:00:36] <Hume2> *mršidlo
[2016/02/07 11:00:54] <Hume2> We are not mario, are we?
[2016/02/07 11:01:17] <mt> So,
[2016/02/07 11:01:33] <Tobbi> No, we aren't, but this is a universal feature. Hell, if I had any friends, I'd love to play SuperTux with them.
[2016/02/07 11:01:34] <mt> multiplayer: good idea, but it might be too much
[2016/02/07 11:01:40] <Tobbi> probably...
[2016/02/07 11:01:42] <Tobbi> I am not sure.
[2016/02/07 11:01:54] <mt> in-game editor: Hume2 is already working on this
[2016/02/07 11:02:05] <Hume2> mt: well well…
[2016/02/07 11:02:09] @ Quit: lumidify: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2016/02/07 11:02:17] <mt> flexlay: great idea, but might be too easy? since large parts of flexlay already work
[2016/02/07 11:02:57] <mt> but yeah, I guess the font thing, in-game-editor, or multiplayer would be nice ideas
[2016/02/07 11:03:18] <mt> and ideas will also develop when students submit more proposals
[2016/02/07 11:03:29] <Hume2> We shouldn't also think too many features.
[2016/02/07 11:03:37] <mt> yeah
[2016/02/07 11:03:45] <Hume2> I think we should pick the best ones.
[2016/02/07 11:03:47] <mt> I guess two students would be enough
[2016/02/07 11:03:56] <mt> since we need enough mentors
[2016/02/07 11:04:03] <Hume2> Do you think that we'll get more?
[2016/02/07 11:04:07] <Tobbi> mt: Flexlay isn't too easy, not the way we think about it anyway. We have terrain generator, and the add-on packaging thing.
[2016/02/07 11:04:19] <mt> Tobbi: okay
[2016/02/07 11:04:22] <Tobbi> We could delete or export my add-on packaging branch and let them start from scratch...
[2016/02/07 11:04:25] <Tobbi> Not sure.
[2016/02/07 11:05:33] <mt> Hume2: if we get accepted as a project we'll get a lot more students applications than two. I think STK had like, a lot more than 10 applications, but only accepted 3 students
[2016/02/07 11:06:05] <mt> however, students usually do some easy tasks before the actual work, to get to know the project
[2016/02/07 11:06:13] <Hume2> mt: So we only need to be accepted, right?
[2016/02/07 11:06:23] <Tobbi> Students will probably like SuperTux until they start working on the code base :D
[2016/02/07 11:06:28] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/07 11:06:36] <mt> Hume2: yes, I think so
[2016/02/07 11:06:44] <Tobbi> So, actually, we should reconsider not applying :D
[2016/02/07 11:06:53] <mt> however, we should probably spread the word of our GSoC participation
[2016/02/07 11:06:59] <mt> D:
[2016/02/07 11:07:13] <mt> (if we get chosen to be a mentor organization)
[2016/02/07 11:07:29] <Hume2> (I hope so)
[2016/02/07 11:07:48] <Hume2> mt: spreading the world?
[2016/02/07 11:08:15] <Tobbi> Like, on twitter or something.
[2016/02/07 11:08:17] <Tobbi> the forums etc.
[2016/02/07 11:08:56] <Hume2> I could make a TeraTux Reborn walktrough :D
[2016/02/07 11:09:20] <Hume2> Or any other walktrough.
[2016/02/07 11:09:40] <mt> Tobbi: possibly also ask other open-source game projects, maybe there's someone interested
[2016/02/07 11:09:45] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2016/02/07 11:09:46] <mt> I mean heh
[2016/02/07 11:09:50] <mt> the students get paid
[2016/02/07 11:10:45] <Hume2> And who controls the students that they really work?
[2016/02/07 11:10:54] <mt> the mentors
[2016/02/07 11:11:01] <mt> who will also write an evaluation
[2016/02/07 11:11:02] <sydney_untangle> mt: Yes i have, but only in maryo racing
[2016/02/07 11:11:19] <mt> sydney_untangle: of the more supertux-like games
[2016/02/07 11:11:38] <sydney_untangle> No i haven't.
[2016/02/07 11:11:41] <sydney_untangle> Im not much of a gamer.
[2016/02/07 11:11:56] <mt> sydney_untangle: then look on youtube oslt
[2016/02/07 11:13:56] <Hume2> We also have to decide how many mentors we will have.
[2016/02/07 11:14:28] <Hume2> Of course that everyone could do that work, but I guess that Google needs to know that.
[2016/02/07 11:14:36] <mt> for flexlay: preferrably Karkus
[2016/02/07 11:14:46] <mt> for the core: preferrably Tobbi or Hume2
[2016/02/07 11:15:02] <Tobbi> Oh dman.
[2016/02/07 11:15:06] <Tobbi> We need to write evaluations_
[2016/02/07 11:15:06] <mt> I could be backup mentor; sydney_untangle probably too
[2016/02/07 11:15:07] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/07 11:15:13] <Tobbi> I am not that good at this.
[2016/02/07 11:15:16] <mt> yes
[2016/02/07 11:15:46] <mt> http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsoc-mentoring/evaluations/
[2016/02/07 11:15:50] <sydney_untangle> I'm no good with the code, but i know a couple things. mt would be better in my opinion for backup though.
[2016/02/07 11:16:08] <mt> sydney_untangle: but at least you can point people to the right things
[2016/02/07 11:16:27] <mt> possibly for core or backup mentors: old contributors
[2016/02/07 11:16:48] <mt> and I don't know what about maths22, haven't seen him talking in here for a long time
[2016/02/07 11:16:55] <sydney_untangle> Yes, i think im capable of that.
[2016/02/07 11:17:11] <Tobbi> mt: I assume he's busy with college.
[2016/02/07 11:17:19] <Tobbi> I don't think he'd leave the project like this.
[2016/02/07 11:17:26] <Tobbi> or high school or whatever.
[2016/02/07 11:18:30] <mt> oh good idea
[2016/02/07 11:18:40] <mt> we should fix the windows build
[2016/02/07 11:18:51] <mt> because I think there's many people using Windows
[2016/02/07 11:19:55] <Tobbi> mt: It's got something to do with an include file that is missing for some reason.
[2016/02/07 11:20:16] <mt> can we easily disable tinygettext?
[2016/02/07 11:20:29] <Tobbi> I am not sure.
[2016/02/07 11:20:31] <mt> so that we have a working, english-only build?
[2016/02/07 11:20:40] <Tobbi> I don't think we can.
[2016/02/07 11:20:57] <mt> would possibly need a fallback _() call that just returns the given arguments
[2016/02/07 11:21:17] <mt> and those called in the language menu
[2016/02/07 11:23:16] <Tobbi> yup.
[2016/02/07 11:23:35] <mt> let's debug appveyor
[2016/02/07 11:23:46] <mt> since when has this been happening? (what commit)

[2016/02/07 11:25:49] <Tobbi> mt: I think I have a regression range, or had one for that matter.

[2016/02/07 11:27:33] <Hume2> OK, should the mentors register anywhere?
[2016/02/07 11:28:48] <mt> I don't get it
[2016/02/07 11:29:19] <mt> this line hasn't been added recently
[2016/02/07 11:29:21] <Hume2> Can just someone say that he's the mentor or he needs to tell it to Google first?
[2016/02/07 11:30:21] <mt> Ask Google's docs
[2016/02/07 11:30:41] <Tobbi> mt: I believe the issue is buried somewhere in that subproject setup.
[2016/02/07 11:30:59] <Tobbi> iirc, the issue first occurred when maths22 did something to the cmake subprojects
[2016/02/07 11:31:53] <Hume2> I think so.

[2016/02/07 11:34:56] <Hume2> I wouldn't like that.

[2016/02/07 11:54:18] <Hume2> Tobbi: You shouldn't hesitate.
[2016/02/07 11:54:18] <Tobbi> mt: What I did to tinygettext was: Include the latest upstream changes in the upstream branch.
[2016/02/07 11:54:22] <Tobbi> And point to that.
[2016/02/07 11:54:35] <Tobbi> Did you change anything in tinygettext's master_
[2016/02/07 11:54:36] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/07 11:55:13] <mt> I told git to use tinygettext/master
[2016/02/07 11:55:18] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/02/07 11:55:26] <Tobbi> Shouldn't fix the build, but might be a necessary thing.
[2016/02/07 11:55:28] <mt> meh
[2016/02/07 11:55:45] <mt> well, the SuperTux/tinygettext master
[2016/02/07 11:56:08] <mt> but since it was broken before you changed it to upstream
[2016/02/07 11:56:12] <mt> it's probably useless
[2016/02/07 11:57:14] <Tobbi> That's what I meant.
[2016/02/07 11:57:58] <mt> however
[2016/02/07 11:58:07] <mt> "Fix build" and "Fix build (again)"
[2016/02/07 11:58:10] <mt> interesting
[2016/02/07 11:58:22] <mt> these aren't in the master branch
[2016/02/07 11:58:26] <mt> but it still builds fine
[2016/02/07 11:59:23] <Tobbi> mt: Those are things I didn't spot during rebasing with upstream tinygettext.

[2016/02/07 11:59:44] <Tobbi> Thanks, Hume2.
[2016/02/07 12:00:00] <mt> you can mention people in commit messages btw
[2016/02/07 12:00:11] <mt> so 'Fixed @tobbi's werror'
[2016/02/07 12:00:17] <Hume2> Travis complains even when the parameter shadows but still can distinguish those variables.
[2016/02/07 12:00:18] <mt> should mention tobbi on github
[2016/02/07 12:00:37] <Tobbi> That's weird. It doesn't shadow, since I prefixed one with this->
[2016/02/07 12:00:40] <Tobbi> but, hey, who cares.
[2016/02/07 12:00:55] <Hume2> Tobbi: Travis would complain anyway.

[2016/02/08 10:43:21] <ElementW> I was talking to uwjesq about Supertux before mentioning the chan name
[2016/02/08 10:43:21] <mt> hi ElementW
[2016/02/08 10:43:26] <ElementW> Hi mt
[2016/02/08 10:43:28] <mt> what's up?
[2016/02/08 10:43:35] <sydney_untangle> Ah. And welcome to the channel ElementW.
[2016/02/08 10:43:39] <ElementW> :)
[2016/02/08 10:44:18] <ElementW> So I wanted to ask
[2016/02/08 10:44:37] <ElementW> has anyone worked on a GL(ES) 2.0 renderer for ST so far?
[2016/02/08 10:44:55] @ uwjesq joined channel #supertux

[2016/02/08 10:45:39] <uwjesq> How are you doing?
[2016/02/08 10:46:11] <mt> ElementW: Until just right now I didn't know what that is so I guess no
[2016/02/08 10:46:14] <sydney_untangle> uwjesq: Good, you?
[2016/02/08 10:46:37] <mt> /* contributions are always welcome */
[2016/02/08 10:46:40] <uwjesq> sydney_untangle: Great.
[2016/02/08 10:46:55] <ElementW> Prepare for PR impact someday then :D

[2016/02/08 10:47:15] <mt> out of curiosity, how did you find this channel?
[2016/02/08 10:48:02] <ElementW> DDG "supertux" -> github -> wiki -> contact
[2016/02/08 10:48:09] <ElementW> Also common sense for FLOSS projects.
[2016/02/08 10:48:45] <mt> and how did you find supertux?
[2016/02/08 10:49:12] <ElementW> Knew about it long ago, forgot, go to university in the meantime, friend plays it for the lulz
[2016/02/08 10:49:27] <ElementW> That's the story so far.
[2016/02/08 10:49:51] <mt> speaking of university: you might be interested in the fact that we're considering applying as a GSoC mentoring organization this year
[2016/02/08 10:50:33] <uwjesq> ElementW: This looks much better https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvmWz0ou_sc
[2016/02/08 10:50:59] <ElementW> uwjesq: indeed this is waaaaaaay more up to date
[2016/02/08 10:51:27] <mt> oh you didn't know about the new stable release?
[2016/02/08 10:51:47] <ElementW> Not even
[2016/02/08 10:52:01] <mt> the new release 0.4.0 is quite different compared to 0.1.3

[2016/02/08 10:53:06] <uwjesq> Oops.
[2016/02/08 10:53:19] <ElementW> >:D uwjesq
[2016/02/08 10:53:20] <mt> ElementW: it a) contains all the images and music and b) contains all the change history since 2000
[2016/02/08 10:53:57] <ElementW> You should've split code and data
[2016/02/08 10:54:16] <ElementW> So you do a full source clone but only a shallow data clone
[2016/02/08 10:54:21] <mt> in fact, some months ago we've tried splitting of the data directory
[2016/02/08 10:54:34] <ElementW> this way you get source history but not always past assets you might not need
[2016/02/08 10:54:43] <mt> but for some reason, it didn't work out and the change was reverted
[2016/02/08 10:54:54] <ElementW> uwjesq: Talk about your experience
[2016/02/08 10:55:00] <ElementW> How I destructed your repo :P
[2016/02/08 10:55:06] <uwjesq> mt: What was the problem?
[2016/02/08 10:55:17] <mt> uwjesq: I don't know
[2016/02/08 10:55:24] <mt> I think it was related to the build system
[2016/02/08 10:55:29] <uwjesq> mt: We did the same thing and cloning finaly is fun again.
[2016/02/08 10:55:44] <uwjesq> mt: How did you try to link the data? By submodules?
[2016/02/08 10:55:52] <mt> Yeah using a submodule
[2016/02/08 10:56:59] <ElementW> 132 MiB and counting...
[2016/02/08 10:57:15] <mt> afc26e0 introduced the change, 59ede11 reverted it
[2016/02/08 10:57:16] <uwjesq> mt: Submodule is the way to go.
[2016/02/08 10:58:03] <sydney_untangle> ElementW: It is quite large. IIRC its pushing 200MB.
[2016/02/08 10:58:09] <uwjesq> mt: The build system should not be affected since to it it makes no difference.
[2016/02/08 10:58:20] <ElementW> uwjesq and I went full idiot (but effective) and rewrote the whole history so the source repo "data" directory never happened.
[2016/02/08 10:58:37] <uwjesq> ElementW: Good times.
[2016/02/08 10:58:50] <uwjesq> mt: We removed binary data from the history, too.

[2016/02/08 10:59:57] <mt> But I don't know anymore
[2016/02/08 11:00:03] <ElementW> mt: IIRC it didn't
[2016/02/08 11:00:07] <ElementW> I was in charge of doing it
[2016/02/08 11:00:13] <ElementW> and nothing was broken
[2016/02/08 11:00:31] <mt> also, rewriting the history that far back is something I don't want
[2016/02/08 11:00:38] <Hume2> Excuse me please now, I should eat something.
[2016/02/08 11:00:54] <Hume2> I didn't plan that, discuss without me.
[2016/02/08 11:01:10] <mt> Hume2: I'm not sure we'll talk about GSoC now anyway

[2016/02/08 11:08:51] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/data/issues/2 is the problem why the change was reverted. However, since the data repo has been deleted, the issue isn't there anymore

[2016/02/08 11:10:21] <mt> Tobbi: why has the data submodule been removed?
[2016/02/08 11:10:28] <mt> We've been wondering about that right now
[2016/02/08 11:10:42] <Tobbi> mt: Because someone (I think it was grumbel) claimed that the history won't be kept intact.
[2016/02/08 11:10:55] <Tobbi> So, since we want that history, it's been revrted.
[2016/02/08 11:10:59] <uwjesq> ElementW: Big improvments in graphics, sound and animation here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFy2SNA3zVA
[2016/02/08 11:11:58] <mt> Tobbi: also, re dirent.h: I'd rather make that work without adding dirent.h, as that worked before as well
[2016/02/08 11:12:00] <Tobbi> Who are ElementW and uwjesq?
[2016/02/08 11:12:07] <ElementW> Tobbi: new guys
[2016/02/08 11:12:15] <ElementW> Coming from ##glportal
[2016/02/08 11:12:21] <Tobbi> mt: I *know*, but in order to get a working windows build, this was necessary...
[2016/02/08 11:12:31] <Tobbi> Feel free to fix the underlying issue. I don't know how.
[2016/02/08 11:12:41] <Tobbi> ElementW, uwjesq: Welcome. :)
[2016/02/08 11:13:24] <uwjesq> Thanks.
[2016/02/08 11:14:07] <uwjesq> Tobbi: Yes. You ruin your history and have to keep a seperate repository to keep your old tags intact.
[2016/02/08 11:14:25] <Tobbi> Yeah, so, let's keep it...
[2016/02/08 11:14:47] <ElementW> PSA: the current repo clone size is 320.73 MiB
[2016/02/08 11:14:48] <uwjesq> Tobbi: I still think it is a better option than keep the main repository broken.
[2016/02/08 11:14:51] <mt> Tobbi: (these people told us they've been rewriting the entire history of their project to remove their data dir)
[2016/02/08 11:15:03] <uwjesq> Tobbi: But I am speaking for myself.
[2016/02/08 11:15:04] <Tobbi> mt: Ouch, that's not a good solution.
[2016/02/08 11:15:20] <Tobbi> Actually, didn't we want to talk about GSoC?

[2016/02/08 11:24:59] <sydney_untangle> Hrm.

[2016/02/08 11:25:51] <Tobbi> Okay, no matter what I do I am getting a 403 error.
[2016/02/08 11:26:19] <Tobbi> I tried registering with two different e-mail addresses.
[2016/02/08 11:26:31] <Tobbi> Hopefully, that doesn't mean I won't be able to register with those again...
[2016/02/08 11:26:46] <mt> maybe we should wait

[2016/02/08 11:39:50] <Tobbi> grr...
[2016/02/08 11:39:52] <sydney_untangle> mt: And why pick on him? Why not pick on the tens of other canidates?
[2016/02/08 11:40:02] <Tobbi> leyyin: You probably wouldn't have said that if I hadn't said anything.
[2016/02/08 11:40:08] <leyyin> MAKING MERICA GREAT AGAIN
[2016/02/08 11:40:10] <leyyin> BOOM BOOM
[2016/02/08 11:40:10] <Tobbi> Actually, was that grammatically correct?
[2016/02/08 11:40:17] <mt> sydney_untangle: do you realize he's racist, and all whatever? anyway, this is not the channel for these discussions
[2016/02/08 11:40:29] <leyyin> look at what I started
[2016/02/08 11:40:44] <mt> Tobbi: well then
[2016/02/08 11:40:45] <leyyin> I should overthrow governments for a living
[2016/02/08 11:40:49] <Tobbi> mt: haha, you actually caught yourself being off-topic. If I had started this discussion, you'd have set <insert weird mode here> on the channel.
[2016/02/08 11:40:52] <mt> you can apply this evening if you want

[2016/02/08 11:42:11] <mt> okay
[2016/02/08 11:42:16] <leyyin> okay
[2016/02/08 11:42:18] <mt> now we can end that discussion
[2016/02/08 11:42:34] <leyyin> only way to end the discussion is to kick me
[2016/02/08 11:42:55] <sydney_untangle> Fine.
[2016/02/08 11:42:58] <Tobbi> leyyin: Don't provoke it.
[2016/02/08 11:43:09] <leyyin> gimme your best shot :P
[2016/02/08 11:43:24] * Tobbi gives leyyin a shot of adrenaline.
[2016/02/08 11:43:26] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Ify ou ignore him he will be quiet...
[2016/02/08 11:43:36] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I don't care... :D

[2016/02/08 11:43:45] <Tobbi> leyyin: What about dropshots?

[2016/02/08 11:44:01] <leyyin> is that mute?
[2016/02/08 11:44:10] <mt> (it will make you not receive any channel messages)
[2016/02/08 11:44:12] <Tobbi> mt: If you want to make channel mode jokes, do it where people are knowledgeable about the topic.
[2016/02/08 11:44:41] <mt> okay
[2016/02/08 11:44:45] <Tobbi> Here, people will be just like "okay, thanks mt, whatever, let the weird guy talk" and those jokes won't have any effect.
[2016/02/08 11:45:06] <mt> can we end the off-topic discussion now really?
[2016/02/08 11:45:14] <mt> Instead of making silly suggestions
[2016/02/08 11:45:25] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2016/02/08 11:45:42] <sydney_untangle> Im shocked Stallman if for abortion. He doesn't like having lives spied on, but doesn't care if they die without having their own choice on life. How sad.
[2016/02/08 11:46:01] * leyyin grabs popcorn
[2016/02/08 11:46:23] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Can i have some as well? And don't forget the salt. :D
[2016/02/08 11:46:32] <mt> sydney_untangle: please drop it
[2016/02/08 11:46:47] <mt> that's also a political view
[2016/02/08 11:46:57] <Tobbi> haha.
[2016/02/08 11:46:58] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, stallman is all about freedom, it makes sense imho
[2016/02/08 11:47:02] <Tobbi> I wasn't the one who started it...
[2016/02/08 11:47:08] <sydney_untangle> mt: fine.
[2016/02/08 11:47:13] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: But it doesn't make sense.
[2016/02/08 11:47:16] <leyyin> stallman wants freedom in everything
[2016/02/08 11:47:21] <leyyin> to everyone
[2016/02/08 11:47:45] <mt> now: all the people who are available should be here, 20:00 UTC+1 for discussing GSoC
[2016/02/08 11:47:52] <Tobbi> yes.
[2016/02/08 11:48:01] <mt> until then, we can have an off-topic discussion
[2016/02/08 11:48:18] <leyyin> soo, did you see the super bowl?
[2016/02/08 11:48:27] <leyyin> me neither, the rest of the world does not care :P
[2016/02/08 11:48:34] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: If he wants freedome to everyone, he would be against abortion, because being killed by your mom because of her poor choice doesn't seem correct.
[2016/02/08 11:48:36] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Okay, assuming the woman got pregnant due to rape, so she never wanted to have the child in the first place...
[2016/02/08 11:48:44] <Tobbi> Are you still not okay with abortion?
[2016/02/08 11:49:06] <leyyin> soo sydney_untangle, you are pro-life and pro-guns?
[2016/02/08 11:49:24] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: So what, its still a life, if they want to commit suicide later in life thats their choice, but when they are a baby...
[2016/02/08 11:49:34] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi leyyin YES!
[2016/02/08 11:49:55] <leyyin> you are contradicting yourself
[2016/02/08 11:50:05] <leyyin> discussion ends here for me
[2016/02/08 11:50:10] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: At which point does life start for you. I mean: Ovum and sperm cells were alive before that...
[2016/02/08 11:50:22] <sydney_untangle> We should ban TVs and make everyone register TVs because they kill more people by falling that guns do...
[2016/02/08 11:50:33] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/02/08 11:50:43] <Tobbi> And, yes, this time: *sigh* is appropriate.
[2016/02/08 11:50:43] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Its true though.
[2016/02/08 11:50:57] <Tobbi> Can this get merged? https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/363
[2016/02/08 11:51:02] <Tobbi> Can anyone test this?
[2016/02/08 11:51:29] * sydney_untangle is thinking...
[2016/02/08 11:51:33] <Tobbi> Okay, since no one volunteers, I will...
[2016/02/08 11:51:56] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, https://youtu.be/vZijLQGH1v0 :P
[2016/02/08 11:51:59] <leyyin> kinda NSFW
[2016/02/08 11:52:13] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I consider it to be a child at conception...
[2016/02/08 11:52:21] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: No youtube videos.
[2016/02/08 11:52:44] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Haven't i told you i don't like google as it is, and you are still forcing youtube upon me.
[2016/02/08 11:52:45] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: What makes the connection of sperm and ovum so different than the parts alone.
[2016/02/08 11:52:52] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/08 11:53:17] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, I do not care really :P
[2016/02/08 11:53:24] <mt> oh my god the pro-life idiots
[2016/02/08 11:53:39] <leyyin> mt, heathen :P
[2016/02/08 11:53:42] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/08 11:53:45] <Tobbi> haha...
[2016/02/08 11:53:45] <sydney_untangle> Good grief, this is going no where...
[2016/02/08 11:53:53] <sydney_untangle> mt: Thanks for calling me an idiot.
[2016/02/08 11:54:00] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I just asked you a question...Answer it?
[2016/02/08 11:54:23] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: No, because we have been over this before.
[2016/02/08 11:54:32] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: *sigh* Okay, okay.
[2016/02/08 11:54:48] <leyyin> no one will change their minds on this topic
[2016/02/08 11:54:50] <leyyin> soo move along
[2016/02/08 11:55:00] <Tobbi> leyyin: It's the same with the refugee crisis...
[2016/02/08 11:55:06] <Tobbi> mt: Your opinion regarding that, anyway?
[2016/02/08 11:55:20] <leyyin> Tobbi, Germany is to blame....
[2016/02/08 11:55:50] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yeah, that's true. But I think it'll all work out eventually... We just need to be strict enough.
[2016/02/08 11:56:08] <leyyin> I do no care a bout backwards american thinking, sydney_untangle you can think what you want, you do not live in Europe :D
[2016/02/08 11:56:13] <mt> re heathen: I'm sad to inform everyone who interprets religious texts literally that they suffer from unreflected obedience.
[2016/02/08 11:56:22] <Tobbi> I think the majority of them are willing to adapt to the culture, so yeah...
[2016/02/08 11:56:38] <mt> I think that we should help the refugees who need help
[2016/02/08 11:57:01] <mt> And we can't send them back to a place where they'd die, even if they're criminals here
[2016/02/08 11:57:01] <leyyin> and mantain the freaking borders
[2016/02/08 11:57:03] <Tobbi> mt: What about people who believe in the bible because it gives them hope or guidance? Isn't that worth fighting for?
[2016/02/08 11:57:29] <mt> But I also think that other EU countries should help refugees
[2016/02/08 11:57:38] <mt> (UK, FR, ...)
[2016/02/08 11:57:39] <Tobbi> I mean: You can't judge people for believing stupid things, if it makes them feel better?...oh, sorry for jumping topics here...
[2016/02/08 11:58:01] <mt> 'literally' 'unreflected'
[2016/02/08 11:58:38] <Tobbi> mt: My mother was religious, and I was grown up with the idea of believing in god...I never questioned it...
[2016/02/08 11:58:46] <Tobbi> So, do you call me stupid, only because I adapted?
[2016/02/08 11:58:55] <leyyin> mt, I disagree, get the criminal scum out of Europe
[2016/02/08 11:59:09] <leyyin> a part of them are not even from Syria
[2016/02/08 11:59:27] <mt> I'd call that unreflected obedience, not stupid. And children might be different, since they can't really think about stuff yet
[2016/02/08 11:59:33] <leyyin> and the legit ones do not get the help that they deserve
[2016/02/08 12:00:24] <Tobbi> mt: There were a lot of people who followed what Hitler said about stuff, because he had charisma. Can you judge people for that?
[2016/02/08 12:00:35] <leyyin> yes :D
[2016/02/08 12:00:45] <leyyin> people are stupid
[2016/02/08 12:00:47] <Tobbi> leyyin: C'mon group psychology...
[2016/02/08 12:00:56] <leyyin> my point = people are stupid
[2016/02/08 12:01:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: If I am too afraid to speak out loud... and just follow the crowd?
[2016/02/08 12:01:08] <Tobbi> Does that mean I am stupid?
[2016/02/08 12:01:20] <leyyin> yes, if you followed Hitler
[2016/02/08 12:01:27] <leyyin> or Trump, same thing :P
[2016/02/08 12:01:41] <Tobbi> leyyin: But group psychology is everywhere...Some things are hidden beneath the covers...Things we don't know about...
[2016/02/08 12:02:08] <Tobbi> And how will I ever get a reflected opinion when I don't know the truth.
[2016/02/08 12:02:19] <leyyin> try to think for yourself
[2016/02/08 12:02:43] <Tobbi> leyyin: I don't know anything about thinking :P
[2016/02/08 12:02:45] <Tobbi> Okay, this gets old.
[2016/02/08 12:03:06] <mt> well: I think people who think <stuff we discussed> and then also think freedom allows them to do everything, that's not okay
[2016/02/08 12:03:08] <Tobbi> leyyin: I guess the truth is somewhere in the middle probably...
[2016/02/08 12:03:21] <Tobbi> Maybe it depends on the situation.
[2016/02/08 12:03:27] <mt> many americans seem to think freedom allows them to do everything, just because they believe in it
[2016/02/08 12:03:48] <leyyin> most americans who folow Trump want fascism imho
[2016/02/08 12:03:57] <leyyin> not democracy
[2016/02/08 12:04:05] <Tobbi> mt: Problem with the concept of freedom is that stupid people do stupid things...
[2016/02/08 12:04:09] <Tobbi> We should protect them from doing it.
[2016/02/08 12:04:17] <Tobbi> Even smart people do stupid things.
[2016/02/08 12:04:52] <mt> well, freedom only can be freedom as long as it doesn't hurt other's freedom
[2016/02/08 12:05:00] <mt> if people still do stupid things then
[2016/02/08 12:05:05] <mt> that's their problem
[2016/02/08 12:05:05] <leyyin> soo, anarchy? :D
[2016/02/08 12:05:26] <mt> leyyin: no, that doesn't imply that
[2016/02/08 12:05:46] <sydney_untangle> *facepalm*, what have i started...
[2016/02/08 12:05:58] <mt> oh welcome back sydney_untangle
[2016/02/08 12:06:12] <mt> also re stallmans opionion on FOSS
[2016/02/08 12:06:19] <mt> I don't even agree with him on that
[2016/02/08 12:06:29] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I cannot seed anything on my internet speed, eh? Ive seeded 30GB over the past week.
[2016/02/08 12:06:38] <mt> BSD is real software freedom
[2016/02/08 12:06:40] <leyyin> do you want something seeded Tobbi ?
[2016/02/08 12:06:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: No? :D
[2016/02/08 12:06:56] <mt> >torrents
[2016/02/08 12:07:05] <mt> nope, thanks. at least here in Germany
[2016/02/08 12:07:18] <leyyin> I seed STK like crazy, I have the windows torrent ratio at 842 :D
[2016/02/08 12:07:22] <mt> (unless you want to receive an Abmahnung)
[2016/02/08 12:07:33] <leyyin> mt, you can't use torrents in germany?
[2016/02/08 12:07:34] <sydney_untangle> mt: I do agree with him to an extent, but he does push it a little too far.
[2016/02/08 12:07:46] <Tobbi> mt: Depends on what you seed.
[2016/02/08 12:07:54] <mt> leyyin: well for open source stuff it works
[2016/02/08 12:08:19] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: 842 times? o_O
[2016/02/08 12:08:26] <mt> but as soon as someone else sees you downloading illegal stuff they're allowed to ask a lawyer to send you an Abmahnung
[2016/02/08 12:08:29] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, that is low
[2016/02/08 12:08:45] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: Ive seeded it 9 times, and that seems like alot for me. whopee. :p

[2016/02/08 12:09:22] <Tobbi> if I did that.
[2016/02/08 12:09:28] <sydney_untangle> lol.

[2016/02/08 12:11:00] <leyyin> sucks to live in Germany :/
[2016/02/08 12:11:00] <mt> some employees apparently told them they could continue
[2016/02/08 12:11:03] <leyyin> torrents are my life

[2016/02/08 12:12:13] <sydney_untangle> Hehe, same here.
[2016/02/08 12:12:16] <leyyin> lumidify, FLOSS movie?
[2016/02/08 12:12:35] <sydney_untangle> WHo watches movies? :p
[2016/02/08 12:12:37] <leyyin> or FLOSS music?
[2016/02/08 12:12:37] <lumidify> Programmers don't have a life, so they don't need movies.
[2016/02/08 12:12:48] <lumidify> *REAL programmers
[2016/02/08 12:12:53] <mt> You don't have a life then, apparently
[2016/02/08 12:13:00] * sydney_untangle hasn't watched a movie in a long time...
[2016/02/08 12:13:04] <leyyin> or books....
[2016/02/08 12:13:11] * sydney_untangle hasn't looked at a tv in a long time...
[2016/02/08 12:13:13] <leyyin> freaking DRM amazon, no thanks

[2016/02/08 12:13:46] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: At $1.29 a song, that is outrageous...
[2016/02/08 12:14:02] <leyyin> sydney_untangle, especially for eastern european salaries
[2016/02/08 12:14:09] <leyyin> the prices are not adapted for the local market
[2016/02/08 12:14:20] <sydney_untangle> And does me buying a song even support the band?
[2016/02/08 12:14:22] * sydney_untangle nods...
[2016/02/08 12:14:44] <leyyin> media companies still wonder why people pirate, because pirating is easy than legally doing it
[2016/02/08 12:14:53] <leyyin> when they make legally doing it more easier, I will do it
[2016/02/08 12:15:16] <sydney_untangle> Or cheaper at least.
[2016/02/08 12:15:24] <leyyin> netflix in Romania, crap
[2016/02/08 12:15:41] <leyyin> or netflix outside USA, it is pure crap
[2016/02/08 12:15:50] <leyyin> 90% of the content is not there
[2016/02/08 12:15:55] <leyyin> and you pay the same price or higher

[2016/02/08 12:21:25] <Tobbi> Hello Karkus.
[2016/02/08 12:21:27] <Tobbi> You're on time.
[2016/02/08 12:21:29] <Tobbi> actually...
[2016/02/08 12:21:34] <Karkus> Hello, Tobbi, sydney_untangle
[2016/02/08 12:21:44] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, we were thinking about applying for GSoC
[2016/02/08 12:21:55] <Tobbi> Applications open in 1 hour and 30 minutes approx.
[2016/02/08 12:22:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Google Summer of Code?
[2016/02/08 12:22:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: Correct.
[2016/02/08 12:22:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: What would that involve?
[2016/02/08 12:22:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: Uhm, we need projects for the students to work on, we'd need to write evaluations...
[2016/02/08 12:23:20] <Tobbi> Anything else...Uh?
[2016/02/08 12:23:27] <Tobbi> mt: Anything else we need to do?
[2016/02/08 12:24:02] <sydney_untangle> mt: A couple days ago i was talking to a friend, and he was trying to tell me that even though this certian company says in their privacy policy that they can do pretty much what they want if you install their program, that they won't do anything at all...
[2016/02/08 12:24:27] <sydney_untangle> That was quite the convo, to say the least.
[2016/02/08 12:25:03] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: We need to actually document what needs to be done? ;p we have never done that before. ;p
[2016/02/08 12:25:21] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I think it would make sense. We can have a look once the registrations are open.
[2016/02/08 12:25:34] <sydney_untangle> Yes, it does make sense
[2016/02/08 12:25:50] <Tobbi> Let's have a look at what's required...
[2016/02/08 12:27:47] <Tobbi> Okay, guys, I will go buy some groceries and some guns... and then I'll be back...
[2016/02/08 12:28:09] <Tobbi> Oh, did I say guns, I meant something completely different...
[2016/02/08 12:28:10] <Tobbi> :P

[2016/02/08 12:56:06] <Karkus> Tobbi: I am willing to help you out, but I don't think I'd like to be a mentor for Flexlay when its at this stage, and I don't have enough experience with SuperTux itself.
[2016/02/08 12:56:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: No problem. We'll just not do flexlay then.
[2016/02/08 12:57:28] <mt> Yeah
[2016/02/08 12:57:32] <mt> Sounds okay as well
[2016/02/08 12:57:51] <mt> Karkus: do you have any ideas for students?
[2016/02/08 12:58:04] <mt> I guess it should be kinda challenging, but not too hard
[2016/02/08 12:59:16] <Karkus> Maybe something to do with scripting? Or the menus (which are a bit ugly atm)?
[2016/02/08 13:01:31] <Tobbi> Refreshing the GUI is fun.
[2016/02/08 13:01:41] <Tobbi> or sure sounds like it
[2016/02/08 13:02:11] <Tobbi> 1 hour until registration opens.
[2016/02/08 13:02:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: What do we need to have in the application
[2016/02/08 13:02:51] <Karkus> ?
[2016/02/08 13:02:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: Not sure yet.
[2016/02/08 13:03:03] <Tobbi> We'll have to see that once they are open.
[2016/02/08 13:03:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: Surely we can look at last years then plan what we're going to put?

[2016/02/08 13:16:25] <Tobbi> but who cares.
[2016/02/08 13:16:45] <mt> nononono
[2016/02/08 13:16:53] <mt> don't create a wiki page in the github wiki
[2016/02/08 13:17:21] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/02/08 13:17:36] <mt> use https://github.com/supertux/wiki and push to that's origin/master and to https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux.wiki.git
[2016/02/08 13:17:48] <Tobbi> I'm gonna delete the page then.
[2016/02/08 13:18:00] <mt> that will also write git history
[2016/02/08 13:18:08] <mt> it will be overwritten by a force push
[2016/02/08 13:18:14] <mt> so create the file in the wiki repo
[2016/02/08 13:18:27] <mt> and also push it to the supertux.wiki repo
[2016/02/08 13:19:25] <Tobbi> mt: Actually, you can do it.
[2016/02/08 13:19:50] <mt> so now you deleted it?
[2016/02/08 13:19:56] <mt> did you have anything on that page?
[2016/02/08 13:20:32] <leyyin> what, github wiki can e connected to another repo? :D
[2016/02/08 13:20:38] <leyyin> TIL
[2016/02/08 13:20:41] <Tobbi> mt: No, I don't.
[2016/02/08 13:20:49] <mt> leyyin: the github wiki is a git repo
[2016/02/08 13:20:54] <mt> and because we don't want spam
[2016/02/08 13:21:07] <leyyin> you can edit the wiki directly there?
[2016/02/08 13:21:08] <mt> but still allow others to contribute, we manage the wiki in a separate repo
[2016/02/08 13:21:19] <mt> where people can pull request
[2016/02/08 13:21:37] <mt> and once there are changes, they will also be pushed to the hidden github wiki repo
[2016/02/08 13:21:52] <Karkus> mt: Automatically?
[2016/02/08 13:21:57] <mt> no

[2016/02/08 13:28:59] <Tobbi> mt: So, what ideas did we have?
[2016/02/08 13:32:11] <mt> multiplayer
[2016/02/08 13:32:38] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2016/02/08 13:32:51] <mt> font improvements (TTF, ...)
[2016/02/08 13:34:45] <mt> Earlier today ElementW asked if OpenGL ES was supported. I don't think it is, so that could be a project too.
[2016/02/08 13:35:04] <ElementW> GL(ES) 2.0 especially
[2016/02/08 13:35:13] <ElementW> Because fixed pipeline is the bane of my existence
[2016/02/08 13:35:40] <Tobbi> GL(ES)? GL for embedded systems?
[2016/02/08 13:35:44] <Tobbi> What would that include_
[2016/02/08 13:35:47] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/08 13:36:10] <ElementW> The ES part is mainly to target low-profile GPUs
[2016/02/08 13:36:14] <ElementW> if you support GL ES 2
[2016/02/08 13:36:20] <ElementW> you support GL 2
[2016/02/08 13:36:22] <Tobbi> ah ok
[2016/02/08 13:36:32] <ElementW> (with some changes between the 2)
[2016/02/08 13:36:42] <ElementW> (mainly shader preprocessor source)
[2016/02/08 13:36:51] <mt> well, a standard OpenGL renderer is already available (see the --renderer option)
[2016/02/08 13:37:00] <mt> would it be hard to then add GL ES?
[2016/02/08 13:37:07] <ElementW> Nope
[2016/02/08 13:37:25] <ElementW> But the current GL renderer is a fixed-pipeline GL 1.0 renderer
[2016/02/08 13:37:31] <ElementW> and GL 1.0 is slow as f!ck
[2016/02/08 13:37:36] <ElementW> (relatively)
[2016/02/08 13:37:47] <Tobbi> Our GL renderer is using opengl 1.0?
[2016/02/08 13:37:56] <ElementW> Yes.
[2016/02/08 13:37:59] <ElementW> Immediate mode calls
[2016/02/08 13:38:04] <ElementW> you pass vertex info 1 by 1
[2016/02/08 13:38:07] <Tobbi> Okay, so that should be changed, right?
[2016/02/08 13:38:12] <ElementW> Yes.
[2016/02/08 13:38:26] <ElementW> you can keep the legacy GL 1.0 backend though
[2016/02/08 13:38:43] <ElementW> just start the new one with a copypasta of GL 1.0, edit to make GL(ES) 2.0

[2016/02/08 13:39:18] <ElementW> Oh in the same vein of ideas and statements, Wayland support isn't coming for you if you stick to GLEW.
[2016/02/08 13:39:20] <Tobbi> Someone else can format that or add stuff...
[2016/02/08 13:39:30] <Tobbi> Oh.
[2016/02/08 13:39:37] <Tobbi> So we *should* switch to GLbinding.
[2016/02/08 13:39:40] <Tobbi> right?
[2016/02/08 13:39:48] <ElementW> don't know GLBinding
[2016/02/08 13:39:57] <Tobbi> ElementW: What else is there?
[2016/02/08 13:40:07] <ElementW> libepoxy
[2016/02/08 13:40:31] <ElementW> EGL support is what you're aiming for max "portability" here
[2016/02/08 13:40:31] @ Wuzzy joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/08 13:40:33] <ElementW> GLX is X only
[2016/02/08 13:40:39] <ElementW> WGL is windows only
[2016/02/08 13:40:42] <ElementW> EGL is cross platform
[2016/02/08 13:40:45] <Tobbi> This is GLbinding https://github.com/cginternals/glbinding
[2016/02/08 13:41:34] <ElementW> Oh that is pretty cool
[2016/02/08 13:41:37] <ElementW> sure you can use that
[2016/02/08 13:42:55] <Tobbi> ElementW: This is not you, is it? https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/323
[2016/02/08 13:43:17] <ElementW> Tobbi: nah, but I saw this issue
[2016/02/08 13:43:19] <mt> Wayland... I like that someone finally wants to replace the decades-old X11 stuff. What annoys me with it is that they don't seem to be willing to add *BSD support :(
[2016/02/08 13:43:20] <Tobbi> ok.
[2016/02/08 13:43:51] <Tobbi> oh! I never heard about wayland before.
[2016/02/08 13:44:03] <ElementW> mt: officially no BSD support yes, but it's still fairly portable
[2016/02/08 13:44:24] <ElementW> Wayland itself only relies on POSIX shm and UNIX sockets
[2016/02/08 13:44:28] <mt> I've seen in 2013 there was some patches, but they weren't tested apparently
[2016/02/08 13:45:26] <Tobbi> What does Canonical have against Wayland?
[2016/02/08 13:45:31] <mt> Well, if it's not systemd-like: 'We're not interested in *BSD stuff even if you write it for us' it's okay. But I don't know much about Wayland.
[2016/02/08 13:46:03] <mt> Canonical also disliked systemd and used upstart until Debian shipped systemd
[2016/02/08 13:46:15] <mt> Canonical dislikes everything
[2016/02/08 13:46:23] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/02/08 13:46:39] @ brmbrmca1 is now known as brmbrmcar

[2016/02/08 13:47:10] <ElementW> mt: Wayland's intent is to kill all the legacy that X is and bears
[2016/02/08 13:47:22] <ElementW> That includes the many dependencies on, today, Linux
[2016/02/08 13:47:37] <mt> Well, would they accept patches to make it support *BSD?
[2016/02/08 13:48:09] <ElementW> depends on who is "they"
[2016/02/08 13:48:14] <mt> Wayland
[2016/02/08 13:48:19] <ElementW> Wayland is a (non-networked) protocl
[2016/02/08 13:48:20] <ElementW> procol
[2016/02/08 13:48:23] <ElementW> no more no less
[2016/02/08 13:48:32] <mt> The team writing the reference implementation
[2016/02/08 13:48:44] <ElementW> then you're talking about the Weston guys
[2016/02/08 13:49:29] <ElementW> But if you're ready to make patches and test them for *BSD
[2016/02/08 13:49:37] <ElementW> I don't see why they'll reject them
[2016/02/08 13:50:08] <Tobbi> Guys, back to topic...
[2016/02/08 13:50:12] <mt> some freedesktop.org projects (e.g. systemd) don't seem to want *BSD support
[2016/02/08 13:50:16] <Tobbi> mt: Is there anything else for GSoC?
[2016/02/08 13:50:27] <mt> For ideas?
[2016/02/08 13:50:37] <ElementW> Was gonna say "graphics" but graphics != code
[2016/02/08 13:50:42] <Tobbi> mt: Yes.
[2016/02/08 13:50:52] <mt> I guess, as I wrote on the page, we'll let students also propose own ideas
[2016/02/08 13:50:57] <Tobbi> Sure...
[2016/02/08 13:51:08] <Tobbi> Just wondering whether there's something we want done. Also, please review my scribblings.
[2016/02/08 13:51:31] <mt> But no my-idea-is-completely-ridiculous-but-Im-the-best-gsoc-student-that-will-apply ideas
[2016/02/08 13:52:08] <Tobbi> mt: Maybe to prevent that, I should apply myself :P
[2016/02/08 13:52:24] <Tobbi> I would get money for being a student and money for being the mentoring organization.
[2016/02/08 13:52:32] <Tobbi> Also, does Google specifically not say that anywhere?
[2016/02/08 13:52:44] <Tobbi> I mean: Say that you're not allowed to do that?
[2016/02/08 13:52:56] <mt> You can't apply as student when you're organization admin or mentor
[2016/02/08 13:53:11] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2016/02/08 13:53:13] <Tobbi> damn...
[2016/02/08 13:53:19] <ElementW> That'd be too easy
[2016/02/08 13:53:25] <Tobbi> mt: But I could apply for other projects, couldn't I? :P
[2016/02/08 13:53:32] <mt> I'm not sure
[2016/02/08 13:53:35] <leper`> wasn't there something about being able to work on it as a student, but you need someone else to mentor?
[2016/02/08 13:53:36] <Tobbi> oh, okay.
[2016/02/08 13:53:36] <mt> read the /rules/

[2016/02/08 13:56:29] <ElementW> Here lies Tobbi's hopes.
[2016/02/08 13:56:35] <Tobbi> yeah, damn it.
[2016/02/08 13:56:47] <mt> "At the end of the Program, Organizations may receive (i) a $500 USD stipend per Student mentored, and (ii) subject to Sections 7.1(e)(vi) and (vii), a $2,200 USD stipend to send up to two (2) Members to the Mentor Summit, by making a request through the form provided by Google by August 22, 2016.

[2016/02/08 13:57:12] <mt> "GET TOBBI ALL THE MONEY"
[2016/02/08 13:57:12] <brmbrmcar> Why do the students get $5500 but the organisation just $500?
[2016/02/08 13:57:29] <mt> brmbrmcar: because the students do the hard work, not the organizations
[2016/02/08 13:57:31] <Tobbi> What? A mentor summit? :D
[2016/02/08 13:57:40] <Tobbi> haha
[2016/02/08 13:57:44] <Tobbi> I will totally be there.
[2016/02/08 13:57:45] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/08 13:57:45] <brmbrmcar> I guess that's alright.
[2016/02/08 13:57:48] <Tobbi> Who else?
[2016/02/08 13:58:08] @ lumidify joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/08 13:59:41] <Tobbi> mt: Will you be joining the mentor summit with me? :D
[2016/02/08 13:59:47] <Tobbi> Or sydney_untangle
[2016/02/08 13:59:58] <Tobbi> or eeh...Karkus
[2016/02/08 14:00:05] <Tobbi> or who else? ;D
[2016/02/08 14:00:27] <Tobbi> Okay, I can now apply...
[2016/02/08 14:01:04] <mt> Just make all the people mentors and invite the to the mentor summit!!!1
[2016/02/08 14:01:12] <Tobbi> mt: Maximum is 2...
[2016/02/08 14:01:14] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/08 14:01:22] <mt> Well, only 2 receive money I think
[2016/02/08 14:02:05] <mt> The others would probably still get invited, but have to pay travel costs
[2016/02/08 14:03:12] <Tobbi> Ah, okay...
[2016/02/08 14:03:29] <Tobbi> mt: Our organization name is "SuperTux Team" or just "SuperTux"?
[2016/02/08 14:03:38] <mt> That stipend for the mentor summit is kinda useless for people who live in the SF Bay area (if Google's campus is referring to that in Mountain View, CA, US)
[2016/02/08 14:03:43] <mt> just "SuperTux"
[2016/02/08 14:03:45] <Tobbi> ok
[2016/02/08 14:05:19] <Tobbi> OKay, now...

[2016/02/08 14:07:26] <Tobbi> I put down 1-5 members...
[2016/02/08 14:07:31] <mt> Tobbi: are keywords enough or do you want us to write 1000 words of blablabla (or is that 1 characters)
[2016/02/08 14:07:33] <Tobbi> Because the other one would be 5-10 members.
[2016/02/08 14:07:39] <mt> s/1 /1000 /
[2016/02/08 14:07:39] <red_bot> mt meant: "Tobbi: are keywords enough or do you want us to write 1000 words of blablabla (or is that 1000 characters)"
[2016/02/08 14:07:44] <Tobbi> I think writing a text would be great.
[2016/02/08 14:08:09] <mt> actually, 1000 words seems a bit too much, right?
[2016/02/08 14:08:13] <Tobbi> I am not sure if I would be a good member...
[2016/02/08 14:08:18] <Tobbi> Yes, 1000 words is excessive.

[2016/02/08 14:08:36] <Tobbi> I am not sure if I would be a good mentor.
[2016/02/08 14:09:09] <Hume2> So I could be a mentor voluntarily.
[2016/02/08 14:09:16] <Tobbi> Hume2: Oh, sure you could.
[2016/02/08 14:09:41] <Tobbi> mt: It's 1000 characters :D
[2016/02/08 14:09:44] <Hume2> Is it like 1000 chars maximum or minimum?
[2016/02/08 14:09:49] <Tobbi> maximum.
[2016/02/08 14:09:54] <Hume2> At least.
[2016/02/08 14:11:00] <mt> can we have an etherpad for this?
[2016/02/08 14:11:04] <Hume2> Well, what questions should be filled truly?
[2016/02/08 14:11:42] <Tobbi> I put down:sure.
[2016/02/08 14:11:45] <Tobbi> eh, wait.

[2016/02/08 14:13:11] <Hume2> I'm not good at this.

[2016/02/09 07:43:52] <MCMic> Is there any easy way to display tux speed on screen?
[2016/02/09 07:48:06] <mt> Tux speed?
[2016/02/09 07:50:02] <MCMic> mt: yes
[2016/02/09 07:50:21] <MCMic> With some scripting or whatever.
[2016/02/09 07:50:33] <MCMic> The same way I can display fps
[2016/02/09 07:50:59] <mt> what unit would you even use for that?
[2016/02/09 07:51:07] <mt> px/s or tiles/s
[2016/02/09 07:51:53] <mt> or x*10**y px/min or tiles/min
[2016/02/09 07:51:57] <MCMic> I don’t really care, I just want to see when I’m slowed down or not
[2016/02/09 07:52:12] <MCMic> I’m only interested in x speed
[2016/02/09 07:52:33] <mt> I'm 99.999% sure it's not possible with the current scripting API
[2016/02/09 07:52:47] <mt> Shouldn't be that hard though
[2016/02/09 07:52:51] <mt> (to implement)
[2016/02/09 07:53:10] <MCMic> I’m trying to do some kind of «Tool Assisted Speedrun» (but I’m lacking the mentioned tools, I just edit a supertux demo file by hand and play it)
[2016/02/09 07:53:35] <MCMic> ok :-/
[2016/02/09 07:55:31] <mt> hm
[2016/02/09 07:55:35] <mt> so it appears
[2016/02/09 07:55:56] <mt> that if you can access Tux as 'ScriptedObject'
[2016/02/09 07:56:11] <mt> you could call get_velocity_x() (or _y())
[2016/02/09 07:58:29] <MCMic> Interesting
[2016/02/09 07:58:43] <mt> if you can't access that for the Player, I can set up a test branch on git to add that
[2016/02/09 07:58:52] <mt> seems like a copy-and-paste task
[2016/02/09 07:59:00] <MCMic> mt: I need to go, but I’ll come back :-)
[2016/02/09 07:59:21] <MCMic> Is it easy to add a script to an existing level? Or a specific game session?
[2016/02/09 07:59:59] <mt> if it works now, in a script 'Tux.get_velocity_x()' or in the console 'sector.Tux.get_velocity_x()'
[2016/02/09 08:00:17] <MCMic> ok I’ll try that
[2016/02/09 08:00:21] <MCMic> see you

[2016/02/09 08:00:38] <pentagon> mt: The operation succeeded.
[2016/02/09 08:03:46] <mt> right now I wonder
[2016/02/09 08:04:09] <mt> if it would be possible to unit test using recorded levels
[2016/02/09 08:05:10] @ Quit: lumidify: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2016/02/09 08:30:18] <mt> is it possible to use a float as string in squirrel?
[2016/02/09 08:30:22] <sydney_untangle> mt: Is'nt supertux also a FLOSS project?
[2016/02/09 08:30:33] * sydney_untangle is reading through that etherpad link...
[2016/02/09 08:31:38] <mt> ugh stallman terms for describing open source software
[2016/02/09 08:32:12] <mt> is it me, or is squirrel's classes syntax *very* similar to ES6's?
[2016/02/09 08:32:22] <sydney_untangle> mt: Ok, FOSS? ;)
[2016/02/09 08:32:34] <mt> "an open source project"
[2016/02/09 08:32:39] <mt> in the first answer
[2016/02/09 08:32:51] <mt> isn't that enough
[2016/02/09 08:32:56] * sydney_untangle is thinking...
[2016/02/09 08:33:08] <sydney_untangle> Yes, i guess it is...
[2016/02/09 08:33:46] <sydney_untangle> Cool, i did not know about Etherpad.
[2016/02/09 08:36:07] <sydney_untangle> I'm still trying to piece together my opinions about free and open source software.
[2016/02/09 08:37:17] <sydney_untangle> I agree with Stallman to an extent, but i also think he over-does it quite a bit.
[2016/02/09 08:37:37] * sydney_untangle flosses his teeth...

[2016/02/09 08:44:42] <Tobbi> Hello.
[2016/02/09 08:44:46] <Tobbi> mt: You there?
[2016/02/09 08:49:50] <Tobbi> mt: In any case, we need to decide on criteria for the students and how they should apply with us...
[2016/02/09 08:51:20] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Well, that they know how to code, thats a big one.
[2016/02/09 08:51:32] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: But people won't apply if they don't know how to code.
[2016/02/09 08:51:38] <Tobbi> It's called "Google Summer of code" afterall.
[2016/02/09 08:51:41] <sydney_untangle> Who knows. :)
[2016/02/09 08:51:44] <Tobbi> I do.
[2016/02/09 08:52:03] <sydney_untangle> nm...
[2016/02/09 08:52:23] <mt> pentagon: later tell MCMic as in the git master, Player.get_velocity_?() doesn't exist, I added it and will soon push it to a separate branch: https://urandom.eu.org/i/9YkaGO7T.png
[2016/02/09 08:52:23] <pentagon> mt: The operation succeeded.
[2016/02/09 08:52:51] <mt> I coded^Wcopy-pasta'ed that right now
[2016/02/09 08:53:44] <mt> Tobbi: have you submitted the application yet?
[2016/02/09 08:53:50] <Tobbi> mt: Not yet.
[2016/02/09 08:54:35] <Tobbi> mt: Actually, not sure if I did... I have to complete the supertux profile first before we're being considered.
[2016/02/09 08:54:41] <Tobbi> So, that's why we need the rules...
[2016/02/09 08:55:33] <Tobbi> mt: So, how do we want the students to apply?
[2016/02/09 08:57:42] <Tobbi> Send an e-mail with their skills?
[2016/02/09 08:57:46] <mt> Aren't there any rules from GSoC
[2016/02/09 08:57:53] <mt> I'd use the mailing list
[2016/02/09 08:58:03] <Tobbi> Guidance for students on how to apply to your organization. Should include any prerequisites or requirements. You may wish to include a template or tips for their proposals. May include limited Markdown.
[2016/02/09 08:58:27] <Tobbi> mt: Mailing list or supertuxteam at openmailbox
[2016/02/09 08:58:31] <Tobbi> ?
[2016/02/09 08:58:36] <mt> mailing list
[2016/02/09 08:58:41] <Tobbi> hmm, ok.
[2016/02/09 08:58:51] <mt> or get all the people with +o here access to supertuxteam
[2016/02/09 08:58:57] <mt> (forwarding?)
[2016/02/09 08:58:58] <Tobbi> mt: Prerequisites or requirements?
[2016/02/09 08:59:06] <Tobbi> I think sydney_untangle can do that.
[2016/02/09 08:59:13] <mt> are there any limits on that?
[2016/02/09 08:59:21] <Tobbi> on what? requirements?
[2016/02/09 08:59:23] <mt> yeah
[2016/02/09 08:59:28] <Tobbi> hmm
[2016/02/09 08:59:33] <mt> also, do applications need to be open?
[2016/02/09 08:59:43] <Tobbi> It only says Guidance for students on how to apply to your organization. Should include any prerequisites or requirements. You may wish to include a template or tips for their proposals. May include limited Markdown.
[2016/02/09 08:59:47] <Tobbi> I will check the rules.
[2016/02/09 09:01:26] <Tobbi> Oh god, the student has to submit an evaluation of the mentors as well :D
[2016/02/09 09:01:52] <mt> sydney_untangle: you might want to forward mails to that address to mteufel@urandom.eu.org
[2016/02/09 09:03:31] <Tobbi> mt: So, do I put down supertuxteam@ openmailbox and I can agree to forward all mails to admins?
[2016/02/09 09:03:53] <mt> where?
[2016/02/09 09:04:05] <mt> for the official recommendations for the place to apply, yes
[2016/02/09 09:04:13] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/02/09 09:04:18] <mt> I guess so
[2016/02/09 09:04:24] <mt> unless someone else objects
[2016/02/09 09:04:55] <Tobbi> mt: What information do we want from potential candidates?

[2016/02/09 09:46:22] <mt> ^^: opinions?
[2016/02/09 09:47:28] <Tobbi> mt: More than two people means three and above.
[2016/02/09 09:48:02] <Tobbi> serveral -> several
[2016/02/09 09:48:06] <mt> "We should totally add a project: convert everything to use trigraphs!!!!!111"
[2016/02/09 09:48:13] <mt> Tobbi: thanks, will fix
[2016/02/09 09:49:14] <Tobbi> but looks good.
[2016/02/09 09:49:27] <Tobbi> I believe it's also fairly diverse.

[2016/02/09 09:50:47] <mt> what do you think about trigraphs? :D
[2016/02/09 09:51:38] <Tobbi> Trigraphs?
[2016/02/09 09:51:42] <Tobbi> What is that?
[2016/02/09 09:52:02] <mt> int main(void){ ... } becomes int main(void)??< ... ??>
[2016/02/09 09:52:13] <Tobbi> ah :D
[2016/02/09 09:52:17] <Tobbi> Yes, fun!
[2016/02/09 09:52:17] <mt> int arr[1] = {1}; becomes int arr??(1??) = ??<1??>;
[2016/02/09 09:52:52] <Tobbi> Only thing missing now is us needing at least two org admins.
[2016/02/09 09:53:15] <mt> "I don't have enough money to buy me a new keyboard, so I'll continue using trigraphs"
[2016/02/09 09:53:38] <Tobbi> mt: I actually invited hume as org admin. Problem is you have to be 18 or older.
[2016/02/09 09:53:52] <Tobbi> A requirement he doesn't meet.
[2016/02/09 09:53:54] <mt> we should ask giby or gr_umbel
[2016/02/09 09:54:01] <Tobbi> mt: You're not 18, are you?
[2016/02/09 09:54:16] <mt> I don't want to be org admin
[2016/02/09 09:54:20] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2016/02/09 09:54:23] <Tobbi> mt: Why not?
[2016/02/09 09:54:29] <mt> because
[2016/02/09 09:54:45] <Tobbi> giby likely won't be around much...
[2016/02/09 09:54:57] <Tobbi> And gr.umbel...not sure if he's interested.
[2016/02/09 09:55:04] <mt> do org admins have to be around much?
[2016/02/09 09:55:08] <Tobbi> Who else is there?
[2016/02/09 09:55:14] <mt> Karkus?
[2016/02/09 09:55:17] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2016/02/09 09:55:20] <Tobbi> Not sure how old he is.
[2016/02/09 09:56:12] <Tobbi> mt: Also, giby can't be admin because he's coming from france, a country currently embargoed by the US. Every country embargoes France :P
[2016/02/09 09:56:20] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/09 09:56:59] <mt> tell him to move to Iceland again
[2016/02/09 09:57:26] <Tobbi> mt: In Iceland they have internet by penguin, which is even less reliable than that pidgin protocol.
[2016/02/09 09:57:41] <sydney_untangle> mt: Move to iceland so he can be a supertux org admin? I don't think so...
[2016/02/09 09:57:59] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Har har har.
[2016/02/09 09:58:13] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: What? Any experience with internet by penguin?
[2016/02/09 09:58:17] <sydney_untangle> I'm not old enough. :)
[2016/02/09 09:58:18] <mt> sydney_untangle: I don't think Tobbi's comment on France was meant so serious...
[2016/02/09 09:58:28] <Tobbi> Of course it wasn't.
[2016/02/09 09:58:29] <sydney_untangle> :-)
[2016/02/09 09:58:53] <mt> did you forget Hume is 116 years old, for google?
[2016/02/09 09:58:57] <Tobbi> mt: http://pastebin.com/JTZFMkjP
[2016/02/09 09:59:00] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2016/02/09 09:59:01] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2016/02/09 09:59:20] <Tobbi> Yet, he has to accept the invitation.
[2016/02/09 09:59:21] <sydney_untangle> My computer is like 70 years old in computer years. :p Does that count? :p
[2016/02/09 09:59:24] <Tobbi> I sent it to his teratux mail.
[2016/02/09 09:59:44] <mt> I'd rather use a new account
[2016/02/09 09:59:55] <Tobbi> I can cancel that.
[2016/02/09 09:59:56] <mt> because otherwise, Google will ask him to be a special guest
[2016/02/09 10:00:00] <mt> :D
[2016/02/09 10:00:11] <mt> because he's the oldest GSoC org admin :>
[2016/02/09 10:00:16] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/09 10:00:25] <sydney_untangle> heh.
[2016/02/09 10:00:54] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Ask your grandma to be an org admin for supertux?
[2016/02/09 10:01:00] <Tobbi> Just tell her she'll get candy and save the goats.
[2016/02/09 10:01:04] <mt> 15:54 -- We would like to take this moment to remind you that we accept absolutely no liability for the insanity you're about to endure.
[2016/02/09 10:01:06] <Tobbi> That will make her agree.
[2016/02/09 10:01:14] <mt> we should add this as an entry message for this channel
[2016/02/09 10:01:20] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/09 10:01:26] <Tobbi> With brmbrmcar, certainly.
[2016/02/09 10:01:32] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Her house is full of candy as it is and she doesn't like it when i bring my goats into her house. ;p
[2016/02/09 10:01:34] <Tobbi> *with brmbrmcar present.
[2016/02/09 10:01:46] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Okay, then tell her she'll get a goat and save the candy.
[2016/02/09 10:01:56] <Tobbi> She'll get a live chocolate goat.
[2016/02/09 10:02:26] <sydney_untangle> No. NO.
[2016/02/09 10:02:38] <sydney_untangle> ;)
[2016/02/09 10:02:58] <Tobbi> Okay, who else can be an org admin.
[2016/02/09 10:03:02] <Tobbi> leyyin can.
[2016/02/09 10:03:11] <Tobbi> He knows a lot about this community.
[2016/02/09 10:03:15] <Tobbi> At least he knows who to avoid.
[2016/02/09 10:03:21] <sydney_untangle> leyyin: You have automatically been OPed to be an admin. :D
[2016/02/09 10:03:35] @ Mode -o leyyin by ChanServ
[2016/02/09 10:03:37] <Tobbi> He's away.
[2016/02/09 10:03:40] <sydney_untangle> lol. ;)
[2016/02/09 10:03:40] <mt> :(
[2016/02/09 10:03:48] <Tobbi> mt: Was that you? :D
[2016/02/09 10:03:51] <mt> yeah
[2016/02/09 10:03:51] <leyyin> why?
[2016/02/09 10:03:53] <leyyin> what?
[2016/02/09 10:03:56] <Tobbi> oh, he's awake.
[2016/02/09 10:04:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: We need another person besides me who is above 18 years old.
[2016/02/09 10:04:08] * sydney_untangle is afk...
[2016/02/09 10:04:15] <Tobbi> for gsoc.
[2016/02/09 10:04:16] <leyyin> for?
[2016/02/09 10:04:24] <Tobbi> gsoc.
[2016/02/09 10:04:26] <leyyin> to do what?
[2016/02/09 10:04:34] <Tobbi> leyyin: Be an org admin. Google requirement.
[2016/02/09 10:04:44] <leyyin> and why can't you be? Tobbi
[2016/02/09 10:05:00] <Tobbi> leyyin: There need to be at least two people.
[2016/02/09 10:05:06] <Tobbi> I am already one.
[2016/02/09 10:05:09] <leyyin> and mt?
[2016/02/09 10:05:15] <mt> don't want to
[2016/02/09 10:05:18] <mt> >_>
[2016/02/09 10:05:19] <Tobbi> doesn't want to for undisclosed reasons.
[2016/02/09 10:05:19] <leyyin> why not?
[2016/02/09 10:05:28] <leyyin> maths22, ?
[2016/02/09 10:05:32] <Tobbi> not around.
[2016/02/09 10:05:41] <leyyin> I am not that involved with supertux :P
[2016/02/09 10:05:49] <mt> we should ask all the possible people via email, I already said that
[2016/02/09 10:05:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: Neither am I :P
[2016/02/09 10:06:10] <Tobbi> mt: No, we'll make it easy: If leyyin doesn't want to, we'll ask brmbrmcar.
[2016/02/09 10:06:18] <mt> maybe giby or maths22 have time
[2016/02/09 10:06:27] <leyyin> I will do it, if no one else wants to
[2016/02/09 10:06:33] <Tobbi> We can see...
[2016/02/09 10:06:47] <Tobbi> mt: Send an e-mail...and we can see...
[2016/02/09 10:06:59] <mt> leyyin wants to save the project from brmbrmcar's insanity? :D
[2016/02/09 10:07:36] <mt> I'll write one, you'll send it from the supertuxteam account?
[2016/02/09 10:07:41] <Tobbi> Okay, fine.
[2016/02/09 10:07:46] <Tobbi> To whom actually?
[2016/02/09 10:07:52] <mt> giby and maths22
[2016/02/09 10:07:52] <Tobbi> Do we have all their e-mail addresses?
[2016/02/09 10:07:55] <Tobbi> Okay, fine.
[2016/02/09 10:07:56] <mt> in git
[2016/02/09 10:08:00] <Tobbi> mt: And Karkus?
[2016/02/09 10:08:06] <Tobbi> Maybe he's above 18.
[2016/02/09 10:08:08] @ Mathnerd314 joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/09 10:08:15] <Tobbi> Actually...
[2016/02/09 10:08:28] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: Would you be willing to be a mentor for SuperTux during GSoC?
[2016/02/09 10:08:29] <mt> Karkus, will probably be here later
[2016/02/09 10:08:49] <mt> (and org admin)
[2016/02/09 10:08:53] <Tobbi> eh, yes.
[2016/02/09 10:08:59] <Tobbi> org admin was what I meant.
[2016/02/09 10:09:06] <mt> but more mentors would be good as well, I guess
[2016/02/09 10:09:21] <Mathnerd314> Tobbi: maybe. I think SuperTux is unlikely to get in though
[2016/02/09 10:09:27] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: Why?
[2016/02/09 10:11:04] <Mathnerd314> they've been scaling down the program, last year was mostly core infrastructure like GNU and research projects in NLP / machine learning
[2016/02/09 10:11:12] <Tobbi> oh...
[2016/02/09 10:11:16] <Tobbi> Anyway, doesn
[2016/02/09 10:11:18] <mt> eh
[2016/02/09 10:11:19] <Tobbi> 't hurt to try.
[2016/02/09 10:11:33] <mt> I think this year they'll accept more projects than they ever did before, math
[2016/02/09 10:11:43] <mt> s/math/Mathnerd314/
[2016/02/09 10:11:43] <red_bot> mt meant: "I think this year they'll accept more projects than they ever did before, Mathnerd314"
[2016/02/09 10:12:05] <leyyin> well it's math :D
[2016/02/09 10:12:20] <mt> "500+ open source organizations"
[2016/02/09 10:12:28] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: If you can PM me your e-mail address, I will send you an invitation.
[2016/02/09 10:12:49] <mt> I think there was around ~150-175 organizations in the years before
[2016/02/09 10:14:29] <mt> ref: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/ (wikipedia still lists the old website on google-melange)
[2016/02/09 10:18:24] <Mathnerd314> well, the 500+ might just be how many applied. but who knows
[2016/02/09 10:21:11] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: Can you please accept the e-mail?
[2016/02/09 10:21:41] <Mathnerd314> I'm filling it out, it's slow. I have to figure out which t-shirt size...
[2016/02/09 10:21:47] <Tobbi> ah...
[2016/02/09 10:23:45] <Mathnerd314> done
[2016/02/09 10:24:34] <Tobbi> Good, so we're now at 100%
[2016/02/09 10:25:18] <Tobbi> I guess that's it.
[2016/02/09 10:25:29] <Mathnerd314> well, I might edit the application a bit
[2016/02/09 10:25:59] <Tobbi> sure.
[2016/02/09 10:26:04] <Tobbi> Do whatever you want.
[2016/02/09 10:26:12] <mt> we should also have an ack from Hume2, Karkus and sydney_untangle
[2016/02/09 10:26:16] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2016/02/09 10:27:35] <Tobbi> I hope it won't be too stressful...
[2016/02/09 10:28:37] <Mathnerd314> hmm. we already have multi-player mode, the supertux-coop patch is easily resurrected
[2016/02/09 10:29:11] <Tobbi> really?
[2016/02/09 10:30:01] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: But that's not split-screen, is it?
[2016/02/09 10:30:14] <Tobbi> Maybe we should adapt that to say co-operative multiplayer.
[2016/02/09 10:30:18] <Tobbi> So, both get the same level...
[2016/02/09 10:30:23] <Tobbi> and have a splitscreen.
[2016/02/09 10:30:32] <Mathnerd314> no, it isn't split-screen. so I guess there would be some work involved
[2016/02/09 10:30:53] <mt> why split screen?
[2016/02/09 10:31:17] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/09 10:31:28] <Tobbi> mt: I don't know.
[2016/02/09 10:31:32] <Tobbi> Just thought it might be fun.
[2016/02/09 10:31:55] <mt> also, where's that patch? I remember there might have been a branch but that doesn't seem to be there anymore?
[2016/02/09 10:32:02] <Mathnerd314> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/contrib/supertux-coop.diff
[2016/02/09 10:32:05] <Tobbi> in contrib, isn't it?
[2016/02/09 10:32:42] <Mathnerd314> the split-screen is useful for if there's a faraway switch, I'd like it for some of our cutscenes too
[2016/02/09 10:33:06] <mt> ok
[2016/02/09 10:33:41] <Mathnerd314> but that patch handles the input and multiple player instances, so a student wouldn't have much to do
[2016/02/09 10:34:04] <mt> what about Wiimotes or similar input methods?
[2016/02/09 10:34:37] <brmbrmcar> Wiimotes need proprietary stuff, right?
[2016/02/09 10:35:30] <Mathnerd314> those would be handled in SDL, not in SuperTux
[2016/02/09 10:36:28] <mt> what about network multiplayer?
[2016/02/09 10:36:49] <mt> or generally, some kind of network integration
[2016/02/09 10:37:26] <mt> the add-on system (especially the currently non-existent API) would need some rework
[2016/02/09 10:38:45] <mt> RESTful API returning S-exp responses :D
[2016/02/09 10:39:04] <Mathnerd314> I guess we could turn the addon system into a Mario Maker clone
[2016/02/09 10:41:22] <mt> integration with the in-game editor?
[2016/02/09 10:44:13] <Mathnerd314> yeah, in-game editor and a backend website for level-sharing
[2016/02/09 10:44:30] <mt> could be two separate projects, I think
[2016/02/09 10:44:40] <Tobbi> mt: Oh, yeah, backend website.
[2016/02/09 10:44:42] <Tobbi> That's a good idea.
[2016/02/09 10:46:07] <mt> re coop patch: wouldn't it make sense to move that to a devel branch?
[2016/02/09 10:49:07] <Mathnerd314> yeah, but it was written back when SuperTux was using SVN (or even CVS, I'm not sure)
[2016/02/09 10:49:48] <mt> doesn't the patch tool accept all kinds of diffs?
[2016/02/09 10:52:27] <Mathnerd314> with coaxing
[2016/02/09 10:54:07] <Mathnerd314> looks like SuperTux would work with https://wiki.gnome.org/Wiican and the config in https://github.com/haxney/wiimote-mupen64, it doesn't look like it would take a summer
[2016/02/09 10:56:55] <Tobbi> bbl, gonna go for a walk.
[2016/02/09 10:58:42] <mt> well, SuperTuxKart has some nice UI for configuring a Wiimote (including pairing with it) and setting up different buttons
[2016/02/09 11:07:11] @ Quit: Tobbi: Remote host closed the connection
[2016/02/09 11:09:27] <Mathnerd314> yeah, I guess we could implement support for wiiuse
[2016/02/09 11:16:26] <Mathnerd314> amazing, there was already a SuperTux GSOC last year: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/tkachov/5707702298738688
[2016/02/09 11:17:03] <mt> Céu? what's that
[2016/02/09 11:17:20] @ mcmic joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/09 11:17:58] <Mathnerd314> oh, it ended up being pingus: https://github.com/Tkachov/ceu_pingus
[2016/02/09 11:19:03] <Mathnerd314> ceu is some kind of experimental reactive programming language
[2016/02/09 11:19:31] <mt> how is it a programming language when it's C++ code
[2016/02/09 11:19:45] <Mathnerd314> http://ceu-lang.org/

[2016/02/09 12:01:00] <mt> fwiw, I usually watch out to keep lines in the wiki at about 80 characters
[2016/02/09 12:01:08] <mt> so it displays properly on smaller terminals
[2016/02/09 12:01:24] <mt> (just like PEP8 wants it)
[2016/02/09 12:01:43] <Mathnerd314> eh, I really wish I could care, but nobody I've met uses 80-char terminals
[2016/02/09 12:02:20] <mt> well, when I want a smaller terminal window I have a 90 char wide one
[2016/02/09 12:02:26] <Mathnerd314> and it's text, any decent editor has line wrapping
[2016/02/09 12:02:34] <mt> but usually I also have my IRC client half of the screen
[2016/02/09 12:02:51] <mt> (which is in a terminal)
[2016/02/09 12:03:07] <Mathnerd314> Tobbi: about the proposals. The GSOC website has its own submission system, do you really need them to also email it?
[2016/02/09 12:03:28] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: I don't know...It's the form that asked...
[2016/02/09 12:04:22] <Mathnerd314> the form is so you can add extra instructions, like "meet with us on IRC before you submit your proposal so we can discuss it"
[2016/02/09 12:04:35] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: Sounds fun, go ahead and add it.
[2016/02/09 12:05:33] <mt> I guess it would still be nice if we had the proposals available for everyone in some way

[2016/02/09 12:51:51] <Tobbi> The web application should output lisp, anyway.
[2016/02/09 12:51:58] <Hume2> Are the admins automatically marked as mentors or they need to specify it somehow?
[2016/02/09 12:52:18] <mt> Everyone who's interested in mentoring and is a contributor, please add you as a possible mentor
[2016/02/09 12:52:35] <Tobbi> I suggest sydney_untangle as a mentor for graphics design.
[2016/02/09 12:52:38] <Mathnerd314> Hume2: I think first we need to get accepted, then we get a new interface to add/remove mentors
[2016/02/09 12:52:49] <Hume2> OK
[2016/02/09 12:53:01] <mt> Tobbi: feel free to edit it on the wiki
[2016/02/09 12:53:13] <mt> also, do we want to restrict it to a specific language?
[2016/02/09 12:53:21] <Hume2> Just a note: water physics != swimming
[2016/02/09 12:53:31] <Tobbi> mt: I was kidding. sydney isn't good at that.
[2016/02/09 12:53:43] <mt> Tobbi: that was re web app output
[2016/02/09 12:53:55] <Tobbi> ah...

[2016/02/09 12:54:04] <Tobbi> Details can be defined whenever.
[2016/02/09 12:54:22] <mt> in the end we'll get a web app written in lisp :D

[2016/02/09 12:55:40] <mt> Mathnerd314: I've got https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux.wiki.git as a separate git remote and also push it to that one
[2016/02/09 12:55:58] <mt> that way, the content will end up being displayed in the project wiki for supertux/supertux
[2016/02/09 12:56:43] <mt> it's being managed like this because we don't want random people to add random content to the wiki, but still allow people who seriously want to change something to submit a pull request
[2016/02/09 12:56:54] <Mathnerd314> ah. I'm just using the web interface, maybe there's some way to add a post-commit hook

[2016/02/09 12:59:13] <Hume2> Because it's too complitated and would reveal our rectangular hitboxes?
[2016/02/09 13:00:12] <Mathnerd314> hmm, I should mention that it requires rewriting the collision detection
[2016/02/09 13:00:14] <mt> Mathnerd314: right, you'd need some server listening on github's webhook notifications

[2016/02/09 13:14:03] <mt> I could actually make it trigger some script to run for supertux/wiki commits, but I'd rather not load the shell module

[2016/02/09 13:18:35] <Mathnerd314> I guess I would not mind so much if the wiki was smaller. but it is 90MB, insane
[2016/02/09 13:18:54] <mt> it's because grumbel imported the mediawiki history in a branch there
[2016/02/09 13:19:13] <mt> https://github.com/SuperTux/wiki/tree/mediawiki
[2016/02/09 13:20:50] <Mathnerd314> actually, travis-ci can do networked scripts. easy enough to add a little hook
[2016/02/09 13:23:43] <mt> you mean 'script: true' and 'after_success: run-a-shell-script-that-decrypts-some-ssh-key-and-uses-it-to-push-to-github.sh'
[2016/02/09 13:23:54] <Mathnerd314> yeah, the only problen is authentication
[2016/02/09 13:24:23] <mt> you can add a deploy key
[2016/02/09 13:24:44] <mt> and store that, encrypted with AES-256-whatever in the repo
[2016/02/09 13:24:56] <mt> and then use a secret travis variable to decrypt the key
[2016/02/09 13:25:45] <mt> however, I'm not sure if deploy keys support pushing to wikis
[2016/02/09 13:26:12] <mt> otherwise, create an account 'supertux-bot' and give it limited access to the supertux/supertux repo
[2016/02/09 13:37:03] <Mathnerd314> hmm, travis already adds a deploy key for the main repo. I wonder if I can copy it so it accesses both
[2016/02/09 13:38:42] <mt> are you sure that this deploy key might not just have been added by maths22?
[2016/02/09 13:39:04] <mt> because in a repo I manage and have Travis enabled, there's no deploy key by default
[2016/02/09 13:39:06] <Mathnerd314> oh, it's only automatically added for private repos
[2016/02/09 13:39:36] <mt> it just needs read access to the supertux/wiki repo
[2016/02/09 13:40:04] <mt> so it would be good to only add it to the supertux/supertux repo
[2016/02/09 13:40:10] <mt> where it's needed to push
[2016/02/09 13:41:16] @ Quit: mcmic: Quit: Konversation terminated!
[2016/02/09 13:41:40] <Mathnerd314> and apparently github disallows using deploy keys on multiple repos
[2016/02/09 13:41:55] <mt> ah right
[2016/02/09 13:42:13] <mt> I noticed that as well when we still had the main repo hosted on Google Code
[2016/02/09 13:42:15] <Mathnerd314> I'll generate a keypair and add it as an encrypted file to the wiki repo, that should work
[2016/02/09 13:42:19] <mt> And I had a mirroring cronjob
[2016/02/09 13:44:24] <Mathnerd314> I can't imagine that Github restricts wiki access, that would be weird
[2016/02/09 13:47:31] <mt> Want me to post some tweet about us considering to apply for GSoC? (https://twitter.com/supertux_team if you haven't seen that yet)

[2016/02/10 06:11:15] <leyyin> yes
[2016/02/10 06:11:26] <mt> Well, depends on your questions I guess
[2016/02/10 06:11:40] <leyyin> it is true that your name must be on the mailbox or otherwise the mail man will not deliver the correspondence?
[2016/02/10 06:12:07] <leyyin> you can't open a bank account because your name is not on the mail box? wth?
[2016/02/10 06:12:16] <leyyin> you have proof you live there
[2016/02/10 06:14:26] <mt> Deutsche Post apparently insists on that from what I've heard.
[2016/02/10 06:19:17] <mt> Apparently there is a law from 1871 that requires that your name must be on the mailbox
[2016/02/10 06:26:00] <leyyin> if you have a family of 10, your mailbox must have 10 names :D
[2016/02/10 06:26:06] <leyyin> where those all those names fit
[2016/02/10 06:26:24] <mt> then you write "Family $Lastname"

[2016/02/10 07:50:20] <mcmic_> https://github.com/MCMic/supertux/commits/release/0.4 started to work on supertux TAS
[2016/02/10 07:50:53] <mt> TAS?
[2016/02/10 07:51:06] <mcmic_> Tool assisted speedrun
[2016/02/10 07:52:23] <mcmic_> Basically I create a record for each level and then edit it by hand to make it perfect (as fast as possible). And I make a version with an option to play all these records as if it was playing the game, with the worldmap and all
[2016/02/10 07:53:39] <mt> can't you extend the existing --*-demo options?
[2016/02/10 07:54:46] <mcmic_> mt: Maybe, but it would be fairly more complicated. It would need to support any world map, etc…
[2016/02/10 07:55:17] <mcmic_> mt: I use the record-demo option to create the record and the play-demo to test it of course
[2016/02/10 07:58:46] <mt> why would it be more complicated to integrate it into the existing options than to implement it as new options?
[2016/02/10 07:59:10] <mcmic_> mt: It depends what you mean by integrating it with the new options
[2016/02/10 08:00:05] <mcmic_> If you mean being able to record/play demo of the whole game, it seems more complicated than just adding hardcoded menu choices in the code.

[2016/02/10 11:34:05] <Hume2> SuperTux-bot?
[2016/02/10 11:35:08] <Hume2> Actually the morphology of the word "robot" is usually desinterpreted.
[2016/02/10 11:35:26] <Hume2> "rob" is root and "ot" is suffix.
[2016/02/10 11:41:38] @ Quit: lumidify: Ping timeout: 276 seconds
[2016/02/10 11:44:36] <mt> it's common to call automated things 'bot', as in IRC bot, build bot

[2016/02/10 11:53:14] <Tobbi> Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?
[2016/02/10 11:58:08] <Hume2> Do you know that it's in terms of GitHub that the user must be human?
[2016/02/10 11:58:13] <Hume2> No offense.
[2016/02/10 11:58:54] <Hume2> Actually I don't know who wants to control that.
[2016/02/10 12:00:48] <mt> "Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted."
[2016/02/10 12:00:59] <mt> "registered *by*"
[2016/02/10 12:01:11] <mt> it means they don't want automated registrations
[2016/02/10 12:01:18] <brmbrmcar> I don't think they'd really care anyway.
[2016/02/10 12:01:22] <Hume2> Oh, I forgot.
[2016/02/10 12:01:55] <Hume2> I really can't read.
[2016/02/10 12:03:11] <mt> They even explicitly allow CI bots or similar

[2016/02/10 12:11:37] <brmbrmcar> Awesome
[2016/02/10 12:11:50] <brmbrmcar> They might come around soon.
[2016/02/10 12:12:10] <brmbrmcar> Closed-source though, undoubtably, to start.
[2016/02/10 12:12:13] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2016/02/10 12:12:21] <Hume2> That's a shame.
[2016/02/10 12:12:53] <Hume2> It could study all the laws and find the holes in it :D
[2016/02/10 12:13:09] <brmbrmcar> I guess.
[2016/02/10 12:13:40] <brmbrmcar> But it would only be availbable closed-source if it was difficult to make.
[2016/02/10 12:13:51] <brmbrmcar> LIke if it is revolutionary.

[2016/02/11 10:20:13] <mt> maths22: since you're apparently interested in mentoring the web thing, should we restrict that to any specific language(s)?
[2016/02/11 10:28:04] <maths22> I don't think so-We should allow the student to choose something they are comfortable with
[2016/02/11 10:28:42] <mt> Indeed
[2016/02/11 10:29:18] <maths22> I will think, however, if there are any suggestions we should make (i.e. Would suggest x, but feel free to suggest something else with a good explanation of why it is better)
[2016/02/11 10:30:27] <maths22> By the way, if you want to see a really good getting started/ideas/etc page, see http://brlcad.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code
[2016/02/11 10:30:49] <maths22> They have participated most years since 2008, so their process is nice and polished

[2016/02/11 12:49:20] <Tobbi> Also, language packs translations should always be preferred.

[2016/02/11 12:49:30] <Tobbi> And third, there should be different dictionaries.
[2016/02/11 12:49:52] <maths22> What do you mean different dictionaries?
[2016/02/11 12:49:58] <maths22> sydney_untangle: OK
[2016/02/11 12:50:21] <Tobbi> maths22: What I mean is: Translations for strings in worlds should be preferred over translations for generic strings in worlds...
[2016/02/11 12:50:34] <Tobbi> Actually, that's probably unnecessary...
[2016/02/11 12:51:05] <maths22> Tobbi: The same string should translate the same across the applicaiton (unless there is some funny case I can't think of)
[2016/02/11 12:51:16] <Tobbi> Hmm, probably right.
[2016/02/11 12:51:30] <Tobbi> maths22: But actually, we should check the translation files for duplicates and remove them.
[2016/02/11 12:51:35] <Tobbi> That's something that should be done.

[2016/02/11 14:19:09] <Hume2> Or doesn't it?
[2016/02/11 14:19:13] <mt> yes, it does work I tested it
[2016/02/11 14:19:26] <mt> there's a few comments missing and I'm too lazy to add those :D
[2016/02/11 14:19:35] <mt> otherwise it's ok
[2016/02/11 14:19:38] <Hume2> Then I think you can merge it.
[2016/02/11 14:20:03] <brmbrmcar> Tilemaps via scripting?
[2016/02/11 14:20:08] <Hume2> I think that get_velocity_x/y doesn't need any comment IMO.
[2016/02/11 14:20:08] <brmbrmcar> AWESOME
[2016/02/11 14:20:56] <Hume2> 48 is the brown block, I tested that on this one.
[2016/02/11 14:21:21] <mt> I'll add comments anyway, for doxygen completeness
[2016/02/11 14:21:45] <Hume2> Yeah, that could be better :D
[2016/02/11 14:22:12] <Hume2> I don't know why, but I still remember some tile IDs.

[2016/02/11 14:22:49] <mt> src/scripting/scripted_object.hpp also doesn't have comments for that
[2016/02/11 14:23:14] <Hume2> True.
[2016/02/11 14:23:28] <Hume2> How the doxygen works by the way?
[2016/02/11 14:23:56] <Hume2> I guess it scans the code and looks for comments, doesn't it?

[2016/02/12 09:20:36] <mt> 22:05:32 <+Tobbi> mt: Can you constify those get_velocity functions?
[2016/02/12 09:20:40] <mt> yay low level languages
[2016/02/12 09:20:57] <mt> should they be const so that the result can't be changed?
[2016/02/12 09:21:12] <Tobbi> mt: Well, const means they don't change the object's state.
[2016/02/12 09:21:14] <Tobbi> Which is the case.
[2016/02/12 09:21:18] <Tobbi> They just return stuff.
[2016/02/12 09:21:24] <mt> ah
[2016/02/12 09:21:24] <Tobbi> And I know, I am OCD about const correctness.
[2016/02/12 09:23:04] <Tobbi> mt: Actually, if you want, you can go through all of the scripting/ functions and check whether they are marked const.
[2016/02/12 09:23:37] <mt> so basically for all get_ functions?
[2016/02/12 09:24:51] <Tobbi> mt: Basically yes. However, I have seen getter functions which change the state of the object.
[2016/02/12 09:25:21] <Tobbi> ...in the SuperTux codebase even.

[2016/02/12 09:32:26] <pentagon> [10supertux] 07tobbi 145faeb20 More work on const correctness in trigger/ [ci skip]
[2016/02/12 09:33:57] <Tobbi> mt: Oh, also, only class methods can be const...
[2016/02/12 09:34:03] <Tobbi> If you have namespace methods, they can't be const.
[2016/02/12 09:34:09] <Tobbi> Actually, that's self-explanatory.
[2016/02/12 09:35:15] <mt> so, namespaces serve no other purpose than code readability?
[2016/02/12 09:35:59] <Tobbi> mt: I *believe* namespace methods are more general convenience methods... since they're only declared once, and are not specific to the object.
[2016/02/12 09:36:06] <Tobbi> leyyin: Correct? not correct?
[2016/02/12 09:36:41] <mt> yeah well namespaces have nothing to write into, like class methods have _this, right?
[2016/02/12 09:37:03] <Tobbi> mt: Well, I think you can declare namespace variables, if I am not mistaken?
[2016/02/12 09:37:03] <leyyin> namespaces have not other purpose than code maintainability
[2016/02/12 09:37:07] <Tobbi> Okay, good.
[2016/02/12 09:37:20] <mt> okay, so what I assumed
[2016/02/12 09:37:25] <leyyin> Tobbi::print and leyyin::print
[2016/02/12 09:37:28] <leyyin> my print is better :P
[2016/02/12 09:37:43] <Tobbi> leyyin: But, still, if I create an instance of an object it also creates an instance of all the methods, right?
[2016/02/12 09:37:57] <leyyin> huh?
[2016/02/12 09:38:08] <leyyin> instance of all the methods?
[2016/02/12 09:38:12] <leyyin> what is that
[2016/02/12 09:38:25] <Tobbi> leyyin: You know, if I say "auto i = new Tobbi();" and class Tobbi has method "print"...
[2016/02/12 09:38:58] <leyyin> you have a new object, you can call any methods of that class
[2016/02/12 09:39:06] <leyyin> I do not understand your question
[2016/02/12 09:39:33] <Tobbi> leyyin: When I instantiate a new class, it allocates memory, right?
[2016/02/12 09:39:44] <Tobbi> And it allocates memory for the method code and for all the properties...
[2016/02/12 09:39:45] <leyyin> depends if on the heap or the stack
[2016/02/12 09:39:54] <Tobbi> Hrm, right.

[2016/02/12 09:40:40] <Tobbi> leyyin: What I mean is: namespace methods are shared across the program, thus only allocated once...and methods of classes you instantiate (on the heap for example) are allocated once for each instance?
[2016/02/12 09:40:42] <Tobbi> hrm, okay.
