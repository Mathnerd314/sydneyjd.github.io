[2015/11/06 11:42:45] <brmbrmcar> There is no advanced HTML needed.
[2015/11/06 11:43:10] <head8debian> Karkus: its hacked together. i have crontab execute a cp command, then i have it execute a git commit and push command and i have a ssh key set up between github and my server.
[2015/11/06 11:43:23] <head8debian> Karkus: Currently it only gets dumped to 1 file.
[2015/11/06 11:43:32] <head8debian> And my website is thrown together...

[2015/11/06 11:44:55] <head8debian> I could do more...
[2015/11/06 11:46:05] <head8debian> There, now its 5 times a day... that should be better.
[2015/11/06 11:46:12] <head8debian> I really don't want to do more than that.

[2015/11/06 12:15:31] <maths22> I'm working on importing my logs from irssi, and then I will try to make a better front-end

[2015/11/06 12:16:23] <maths22> Karkus: not sure, but the really nice thing about it is that, once I finish making my script, it will be really easy to import logs from irrsi if the logserver goes down

[2015/11/06 17:02:05] <leyyin> btw, I used the travis file from supertux for the stk-editor ;)
[2015/11/06 17:02:12] <leyyin> without proper reference

[2015/11/06 17:05:30] <Karkus> Sorry
[2015/11/06 17:05:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's alright. I am not mean.
[2015/11/06 17:05:36] <Tobbi> I am evil.
[2015/11/06 17:06:00] <leyyin> Tobbi, if you are evil then I am Stalin
[2015/11/06 17:06:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: I think you should stick to torturing babies
[2015/11/06 17:06:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, yeah, we need to devise a new method...
[2015/11/06 17:06:26] <Karkus> Okay that has no context
[2015/11/06 17:06:28] <Tobbi> What about those wind turbines...

[2015/11/06 17:06:35] <Tobbi> We could couple them with cherry cake.

[2015/11/06 17:07:23] <Tobbi> leyyin: We never talked about literally torturing babies.
[2015/11/06 17:07:34] <leyyin> you live in Germany man
[2015/11/06 17:07:40] <Tobbi> And, for the most part, no one of us has ever tortured a baby.
[2015/11/06 17:07:49] <leyyin> they arrest you just for wearing an indian sign ;)
[2015/11/06 17:07:57] <red_bot> Tobbi: sure... your talking about putting 1 baby in 3 trach cans...
[2015/11/06 17:07:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: Speak for yourself :D
[2015/11/06 17:07:58] <Tobbi> leyyin: *cough*
[2015/11/06 17:08:06] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/11/06 17:08:14] <red_bot> Tobbi: According to my perfect logs...
[2015/11/06 17:08:24] <Tobbi> That's the exception. If you believe in Buddhism, it's not actually killing if the baby gets reborn.
[2015/11/06 17:08:38] <Karkus> There are advantages to not having logs too, I guess
[2015/11/06 17:08:42] <Tobbi> Wait, Buddhism, Hinduism, right?
[2015/11/06 17:08:53] <head8debian> Karkus: Haha, true.

[2015/11/06 17:26:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh c'mon...

[2015/11/06 17:33:12] <brmbrmcar> It is the United Kingdom!

[2015/11/06 17:35:08] <brmbrmcar> Why?
[2015/11/06 17:35:43] <Karkus> Why what?
[2015/11/06 17:36:07] <brmbrmcar> Do you not want NI or Wales?
[2015/11/06 17:36:43] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Where do you live?

[2015/11/06 17:37:21] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/06 17:37:26] <Karkus> and Wales, well idk I can't understand them

[2015/11/06 18:01:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: It was speculated a while ago that swimming could be implemented in supertux. Could that be a 0.5.0 thing or is it not possible due the amount of levels that rely on you being unable to swim?
[2015/11/06 18:01:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could certainly put it in the 0.5.0 release list.
[2015/11/06 18:01:39] <Tobbi> eeh, todo list.
[2015/11/06 18:01:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Which is where?
[2015/11/06 18:01:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: not yet created.
[2015/11/06 18:02:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: file a bug report.

[2015/11/06 18:02:15] <Karkus> okay
[2015/11/06 18:02:29] <Tobbi> We'd have to go through the list of levels to see which of these use water...

[2015/11/06 18:04:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe a lot of levels require you to be unable to swim... But maybe we could add a special bonus item.

[2015/11/06 18:13:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: that would be cool. :D What kind of item do you think should give tux the ability to swim?
[2015/11/06 18:13:52] <Tobbi> Because otherwise, we'd have to rework a lot of levels.
[2015/11/06 18:14:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: Flippers would be a kinda funny one
[2015/11/06 18:14:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Penguins are pretty epic at swimming anyway :P
[2015/11/06 18:14:34] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/11/06 18:15:13] <Tobbi> oh, wait. Water has never really been solid.
[2015/11/06 18:15:26] <Tobbi> So, we don't need a special item for tht
[2015/11/06 18:15:27] <Tobbi> that
[2015/11/06 18:15:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: How about this for music: https://soundcloud.com/karkus476/water-theme? Please be honest if it's bad. it's a proof of concept unfinished thing
[2015/11/06 18:16:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: we do, as many levels have water that, if you could swim in it, would make the level easy
[2015/11/06 18:16:29] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2015/11/06 18:16:33] <Tobbi> hah, confusion.
[2015/11/06 18:16:41] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, that theme plays when Tux swims?
[2015/11/06 18:16:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, in underwater levels
[2015/11/06 18:16:59] <Tobbi> Ah...
[2015/11/06 18:17:03] <Tobbi> Hmm, interesting.
[2015/11/06 18:17:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: In my opinion, it needs a more mysterious touch.
[2015/11/06 18:17:37] <Tobbi> Or?
[2015/11/06 18:17:39] <Tobbi> Let me check something.
[2015/11/06 18:17:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah, I see.
[2015/11/06 18:20:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Check what?

[2015/11/06 18:20:30] <Tobbi> Do you know Fish Fillets - Next Generation.
[2015/11/06 18:20:33] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/11/06 18:20:42] <Tobbi> The music doesn't fit well, either.
[2015/11/06 18:21:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't know it
[2015/11/06 18:21:27] <Tobbi> okay.
[2015/11/06 18:21:41] <Karkus> And which music doesn't fit well?
[2015/11/06 18:21:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: The one I linked to, above.
[2015/11/06 18:21:59] <Karkus> Oh, okay
[2015/11/06 18:22:18] <Tobbi> We need something funky, but something that is mysterious at the same time, and "underwater". :P
[2015/11/06 18:22:50] <Tobbi> On the other hand.
[2015/11/06 18:22:56] <Karkus> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xelag0YVrcs
[2015/11/06 18:22:59] <Tobbi> I just checked mario's underwater theme...
[2015/11/06 18:23:05] <Karkus> Ah
[2015/11/06 18:23:43] <Tobbi> Okay, so maybe I was too strict there :D
[2015/11/06 18:24:23] <Karkus> I get what you mean.
[2015/11/06 18:24:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could have music blocks... Things that play a certain note when you hit them :D
[2015/11/06 18:24:55] <Tobbi> And people could play around with that then :D
[2015/11/06 18:25:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: But we need a good editor :P
[2015/11/06 18:25:20] <Tobbi> *sigh* yeah, you're right :D
[2015/11/06 18:25:21] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/11/06 18:25:27] <Tobbi> That prerequisite...
[2015/11/06 18:25:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Add it to the list
[2015/11/06 18:25:42] <Tobbi> Not sure if I should or how much fun that would be :D
[2015/11/06 18:26:48] <Karkus> Tobbi: Once I've done this controls thing I'll see what I can do for the editor.
[2015/11/06 18:26:56] <Tobbi> Alright, thanks
[2015/11/06 18:26:57] <Tobbi> !
[2015/11/06 18:27:14] <Karkus> I wish Grumbel had just commented his code in the first place
[2015/11/06 18:27:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do many OS projects have documentation?
[2015/11/06 18:28:10] <Tobbi> Hmm, that's a thing I don't know. I don't normally follow that many open source projects.
[2015/11/06 18:28:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/06 18:28:26] <Karkus> I doubt it though
[2015/11/06 18:30:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: on the other hand, levels based on music will likely be hard for the hearing impaired.
[2015/11/06 18:30:26] <Tobbi> So maybe we shouldn't develop that idea further...
[2015/11/06 18:31:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: We should have a braile version of the wiki
[2015/11/06 18:31:32] <Karkus> jk :D
[2015/11/06 18:31:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: We could have subtitles
[2015/11/06 18:31:49] <Karkus> If you *really* want
[2015/11/06 18:32:04] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:32:08] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2015/11/06 18:32:23] <Tobbi> How would a music level actually look like anyway?
[2015/11/06 18:32:24] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:33:00] <Tobbi> But, yeah, braille...
[2015/11/06 18:33:01] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:33:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: But, yeah, braille, no :P
[2015/11/06 18:33:47] <datahead8888> A music based level would probably have differet notes or snippets of music play at different points that cue the player in to actions.  For visual look you could have staffs and/or notes.
[2015/11/06 18:34:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: What program did you use to compose the music?
[2015/11/06 18:34:13] <datahead8888> For the hearing impaired you would have to have text that allows them to get the hints without auditory cues.
[2015/11/06 18:34:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: Musescore
[2015/11/06 18:34:24] <Tobbi> Sounds interesting.
[2015/11/06 18:34:49] <datahead8888> Now, programming levels for the blind would be interesting.  You would need auditory cues that allow them to play in a "dark level" so as to speak
[2015/11/06 18:34:53] <Karkus> You can probably already script sounds in anyway
[2015/11/06 18:35:13] <Karkus> Echo location supertux, anyone?
[2015/11/06 18:35:21] <datahead8888> Oh, that's a good idea
[2015/11/06 18:35:32] <datahead8888> It would make an interesting challenge for people who see, too
[2015/11/06 18:35:47] <datahead8888> It would probably have to be a slow moving level
[2015/11/06 18:36:04] <datahead8888> You wouldn't want enemies that move fast and dive bomb the player in something like that :)
[2015/11/06 18:36:16] <Tobbi> Create issues, guys.
[2015/11/06 18:36:17] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:36:19] <Karkus> datahead8888: A pit would be hard enough
[2015/11/06 18:36:29] <Tobbi> Interesting thing for post 0.4.0
[2015/11/06 18:36:45] <Karkus> Everything is interesting when it's post 0.4.0 :D
[2015/11/06 18:36:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:37:19] <datahead8888> I've suggested some of this kind of stuff for Secret Chronicles before - it's all a matter of priorities
[2015/11/06 18:37:24] <datahead8888> But if you want, I could file some issues
[2015/11/06 18:38:27] <datahead8888> While you're at it, it's good to think about disability accessibility for the whole game
[2015/11/06 18:38:32] <datahead8888> What if you have a color blind player?
[2015/11/06 18:38:54] <datahead8888> Or have tones in other parts of the game
[2015/11/06 18:39:22] <Tobbi> But it's hard for colour blind people, anyway.
[2015/11/06 18:39:28] <Tobbi> Unless we filter everything in specific colours/
[2015/11/06 18:39:46] <datahead8888> Well, you'd probably focus on critical items they have to differentiate.
[2015/11/06 18:40:12] <datahead8888> It might be a bit challenging to do unless you can find a color blind volunteer to check out the game
[2015/11/06 18:42:45] <Karkus> datahead8debian: Colour blindness does not affect people that much
[2015/11/06 18:43:09] <Karkus> It's not like black and white, and supertux doesn't need colours to fucntion
[2015/11/06 18:44:00] <datahead8888> If you had text without good contrast it could become an issue
[2015/11/06 18:45:13] <Karkus> datahead8888: I guess. Maybe.
[2015/11/06 18:45:29] <datahead8888> It might not be an issue at all now, though
