[2015/11/06 11:42:45] <brmbrmcar> There is no advanced HTML needed.
[2015/11/06 11:43:10] <head8debian> Karkus: its hacked together. i have crontab execute a cp command, then i have it execute a git commit and push command and i have a ssh key set up between github and my server.
[2015/11/06 11:43:23] <head8debian> Karkus: Currently it only gets dumped to 1 file.
[2015/11/06 11:43:32] <head8debian> And my website is thrown together...

[2015/11/06 11:44:55] <head8debian> I could do more...
[2015/11/06 11:46:05] <head8debian> There, now its 5 times a day... that should be better.
[2015/11/06 11:46:12] <head8debian> I really don't want to do more than that.

[2015/11/06 12:15:31] <maths22> I'm working on importing my logs from irssi, and then I will try to make a better front-end

[2015/11/06 12:16:23] <maths22> Karkus: not sure, but the really nice thing about it is that, once I finish making my script, it will be really easy to import logs from irrsi if the logserver goes down

[2015/11/06 17:02:05] <leyyin> btw, I used the travis file from supertux for the stk-editor ;)
[2015/11/06 17:02:12] <leyyin> without proper reference

[2015/11/06 17:05:30] <Karkus> Sorry
[2015/11/06 17:05:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's alright. I am not mean.
[2015/11/06 17:05:36] <Tobbi> I am evil.
[2015/11/06 17:06:00] <leyyin> Tobbi, if you are evil then I am Stalin
[2015/11/06 17:06:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: I think you should stick to torturing babies
[2015/11/06 17:06:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, yeah, we need to devise a new method...
[2015/11/06 17:06:26] <Karkus> Okay that has no context
[2015/11/06 17:06:28] <Tobbi> What about those wind turbines...

[2015/11/06 17:06:35] <Tobbi> We could couple them with cherry cake.

[2015/11/06 17:07:23] <Tobbi> leyyin: We never talked about literally torturing babies.
[2015/11/06 17:07:34] <leyyin> you live in Germany man
[2015/11/06 17:07:40] <Tobbi> And, for the most part, no one of us has ever tortured a baby.
[2015/11/06 17:07:49] <leyyin> they arrest you just for wearing an indian sign ;)
[2015/11/06 17:07:57] <red_bot> Tobbi: sure... your talking about putting 1 baby in 3 trach cans...
[2015/11/06 17:07:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: Speak for yourself :D
[2015/11/06 17:07:58] <Tobbi> leyyin: *cough*
[2015/11/06 17:08:06] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/11/06 17:08:14] <red_bot> Tobbi: According to my perfect logs...
[2015/11/06 17:08:24] <Tobbi> That's the exception. If you believe in Buddhism, it's not actually killing if the baby gets reborn.
[2015/11/06 17:08:38] <Karkus> There are advantages to not having logs too, I guess
[2015/11/06 17:08:42] <Tobbi> Wait, Buddhism, Hinduism, right?
[2015/11/06 17:08:53] <head8debian> Karkus: Haha, true.

[2015/11/06 17:26:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh c'mon...

[2015/11/06 17:33:12] <brmbrmcar> It is the United Kingdom!

[2015/11/06 17:35:08] <brmbrmcar> Why?
[2015/11/06 17:35:43] <Karkus> Why what?
[2015/11/06 17:36:07] <brmbrmcar> Do you not want NI or Wales?
[2015/11/06 17:36:43] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Where do you live?

[2015/11/06 17:37:21] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/06 17:37:26] <Karkus> and Wales, well idk I can't understand them

[2015/11/06 18:01:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: It was speculated a while ago that swimming could be implemented in supertux. Could that be a 0.5.0 thing or is it not possible due the amount of levels that rely on you being unable to swim?
[2015/11/06 18:01:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could certainly put it in the 0.5.0 release list.
[2015/11/06 18:01:39] <Tobbi> eeh, todo list.
[2015/11/06 18:01:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Which is where?
[2015/11/06 18:01:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: not yet created.
[2015/11/06 18:02:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: file a bug report.

[2015/11/06 18:02:15] <Karkus> okay
[2015/11/06 18:02:29] <Tobbi> We'd have to go through the list of levels to see which of these use water...

[2015/11/06 18:04:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe a lot of levels require you to be unable to swim... But maybe we could add a special bonus item.

[2015/11/06 18:13:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: that would be cool. :D What kind of item do you think should give tux the ability to swim?
[2015/11/06 18:13:52] <Tobbi> Because otherwise, we'd have to rework a lot of levels.
[2015/11/06 18:14:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: Flippers would be a kinda funny one
[2015/11/06 18:14:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Penguins are pretty epic at swimming anyway :P
[2015/11/06 18:14:34] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/11/06 18:15:13] <Tobbi> oh, wait. Water has never really been solid.
[2015/11/06 18:15:26] <Tobbi> So, we don't need a special item for tht
[2015/11/06 18:15:27] <Tobbi> that
[2015/11/06 18:15:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: How about this for music: https://soundcloud.com/karkus476/water-theme? Please be honest if it's bad. it's a proof of concept unfinished thing
[2015/11/06 18:16:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: we do, as many levels have water that, if you could swim in it, would make the level easy
[2015/11/06 18:16:29] <Tobbi> Oh, yes.
[2015/11/06 18:16:33] <Tobbi> hah, confusion.
[2015/11/06 18:16:41] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, that theme plays when Tux swims?
[2015/11/06 18:16:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, in underwater levels
[2015/11/06 18:16:59] <Tobbi> Ah...
[2015/11/06 18:17:03] <Tobbi> Hmm, interesting.
[2015/11/06 18:17:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: In my opinion, it needs a more mysterious touch.
[2015/11/06 18:17:37] <Tobbi> Or?
[2015/11/06 18:17:39] <Tobbi> Let me check something.
[2015/11/06 18:17:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah, I see.
[2015/11/06 18:20:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Check what?

[2015/11/06 18:20:30] <Tobbi> Do you know Fish Fillets - Next Generation.
[2015/11/06 18:20:33] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/11/06 18:20:42] <Tobbi> The music doesn't fit well, either.
[2015/11/06 18:21:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't know it
[2015/11/06 18:21:27] <Tobbi> okay.
[2015/11/06 18:21:41] <Karkus> And which music doesn't fit well?
[2015/11/06 18:21:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: The one I linked to, above.
[2015/11/06 18:21:59] <Karkus> Oh, okay
[2015/11/06 18:22:18] <Tobbi> We need something funky, but something that is mysterious at the same time, and "underwater". :P
[2015/11/06 18:22:50] <Tobbi> On the other hand.
[2015/11/06 18:22:56] <Karkus> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xelag0YVrcs
[2015/11/06 18:22:59] <Tobbi> I just checked mario's underwater theme...
[2015/11/06 18:23:05] <Karkus> Ah
[2015/11/06 18:23:43] <Tobbi> Okay, so maybe I was too strict there :D
[2015/11/06 18:24:23] <Karkus> I get what you mean.
[2015/11/06 18:24:47] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could have music blocks... Things that play a certain note when you hit them :D
[2015/11/06 18:24:55] <Tobbi> And people could play around with that then :D
[2015/11/06 18:25:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: But we need a good editor :P
[2015/11/06 18:25:20] <Tobbi> *sigh* yeah, you're right :D
[2015/11/06 18:25:21] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/11/06 18:25:27] <Tobbi> That prerequisite...
[2015/11/06 18:25:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Add it to the list
[2015/11/06 18:25:42] <Tobbi> Not sure if I should or how much fun that would be :D
[2015/11/06 18:26:48] <Karkus> Tobbi: Once I've done this controls thing I'll see what I can do for the editor.
[2015/11/06 18:26:56] <Tobbi> Alright, thanks
[2015/11/06 18:26:57] <Tobbi> !
[2015/11/06 18:27:14] <Karkus> I wish Grumbel had just commented his code in the first place
[2015/11/06 18:27:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do many OS projects have documentation?
[2015/11/06 18:28:10] <Tobbi> Hmm, that's a thing I don't know. I don't normally follow that many open source projects.
[2015/11/06 18:28:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/06 18:28:26] <Karkus> I doubt it though
[2015/11/06 18:30:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: on the other hand, levels based on music will likely be hard for the hearing impaired.
[2015/11/06 18:30:26] <Tobbi> So maybe we shouldn't develop that idea further...
[2015/11/06 18:31:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: We should have a braile version of the wiki
[2015/11/06 18:31:32] <Karkus> jk :D
[2015/11/06 18:31:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: We could have subtitles
[2015/11/06 18:31:49] <Karkus> If you *really* want
[2015/11/06 18:32:04] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:32:08] <Tobbi> Hmm...
[2015/11/06 18:32:23] <Tobbi> How would a music level actually look like anyway?
[2015/11/06 18:32:24] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:33:00] <Tobbi> But, yeah, braille...
[2015/11/06 18:33:01] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:33:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: But, yeah, braille, no :P
[2015/11/06 18:33:47] <datahead8888> A music based level would probably have differet notes or snippets of music play at different points that cue the player in to actions.  For visual look you could have staffs and/or notes.
[2015/11/06 18:34:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: What program did you use to compose the music?
[2015/11/06 18:34:13] <datahead8888> For the hearing impaired you would have to have text that allows them to get the hints without auditory cues.
[2015/11/06 18:34:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: Musescore
[2015/11/06 18:34:24] <Tobbi> Sounds interesting.
[2015/11/06 18:34:49] <datahead8888> Now, programming levels for the blind would be interesting.  You would need auditory cues that allow them to play in a "dark level" so as to speak
[2015/11/06 18:34:53] <Karkus> You can probably already script sounds in anyway
[2015/11/06 18:35:13] <Karkus> Echo location supertux, anyone?
[2015/11/06 18:35:21] <datahead8888> Oh, that's a good idea
[2015/11/06 18:35:32] <datahead8888> It would make an interesting challenge for people who see, too
[2015/11/06 18:35:47] <datahead8888> It would probably have to be a slow moving level
[2015/11/06 18:36:04] <datahead8888> You wouldn't want enemies that move fast and dive bomb the player in something like that :)
[2015/11/06 18:36:16] <Tobbi> Create issues, guys.
[2015/11/06 18:36:17] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:36:19] <Karkus> datahead8888: A pit would be hard enough
[2015/11/06 18:36:29] <Tobbi> Interesting thing for post 0.4.0
[2015/11/06 18:36:45] <Karkus> Everything is interesting when it's post 0.4.0 :D
[2015/11/06 18:36:57] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/06 18:37:19] <datahead8888> I've suggested some of this kind of stuff for Secret Chronicles before - it's all a matter of priorities
[2015/11/06 18:37:24] <datahead8888> But if you want, I could file some issues
[2015/11/06 18:38:27] <datahead8888> While you're at it, it's good to think about disability accessibility for the whole game
[2015/11/06 18:38:32] <datahead8888> What if you have a color blind player?
[2015/11/06 18:38:54] <datahead8888> Or have tones in other parts of the game
[2015/11/06 18:39:22] <Tobbi> But it's hard for colour blind people, anyway.
[2015/11/06 18:39:28] <Tobbi> Unless we filter everything in specific colours/
[2015/11/06 18:39:46] <datahead8888> Well, you'd probably focus on critical items they have to differentiate.
[2015/11/06 18:40:12] <datahead8888> It might be a bit challenging to do unless you can find a color blind volunteer to check out the game
[2015/11/06 18:42:45] <Karkus> datahead8debian: Colour blindness does not affect people that much
[2015/11/06 18:43:09] <Karkus> It's not like black and white, and supertux doesn't need colours to fucntion
[2015/11/06 18:44:00] <datahead8888> If you had text without good contrast it could become an issue
[2015/11/06 18:45:13] <Karkus> datahead8888: I guess. Maybe.
[2015/11/06 18:45:29] <datahead8888> It might not be an issue at all now, though

[2015/11/07 10:21:38] <leyyin> higher dpi
[2015/11/07 10:22:31] <Hume2> What do they expect? I don't want to see what's on my computer via a microscope.
[2015/11/07 10:22:45] <head8debian> What i have works fine.
[2015/11/07 10:22:48] <leyyin> you can see the diference man ;)
[2015/11/07 10:22:54] <leyyin> higher quality
[2015/11/07 10:22:58] <leyyin> more sharp
[2015/11/07 10:23:00] <head8debian> Yes i can, ive seen a 4k screen.
[2015/11/07 10:23:05] <leyyin> it's like looking out of a window
[2015/11/07 10:23:09] <head8debian> But my wallet cringes. :D
[2015/11/07 10:23:18] <head8debian> And i only get new when my old breaks.

[2015/11/07 10:24:11] <head8debian> Hey, im still using a 15in 1024x768px screen. :)
[2015/11/07 10:24:29] <leyyin> that is a weird resolution
[2015/11/07 10:24:36] <Hume2> I'm using 1536Ã768 screen.
[2015/11/07 10:24:48] <leyyin> are you sure it is not 1366? Hume2
[2015/11/07 10:25:03] <head8debian> My main screen is 1600x900.
[2015/11/07 10:25:22] <Hume2> leyyin: Yes, that's right.
[2015/11/07 10:25:28] <Hume2> leyyin: 1366
[2015/11/07 10:25:35] <Hume2> it is.
[2015/11/07 10:25:42] <head8debian> Only 11954 hours on it. :D
[2015/11/07 10:25:56] <leyyin> how can you tell? head8debian
[2015/11/07 10:26:14] <head8debian> My screen has a menu which tells me...

[2015/11/07 10:26:42] <leyyin> what?
[2015/11/07 10:26:50] <leyyin> what crappy tractors do you have?
[2015/11/07 10:26:57] <leyyin> I have seen tractors old as 40 years
[2015/11/07 10:26:59] <leyyin> still running
[2015/11/07 10:27:07] <head8debian> Only 40? :)
[2015/11/07 10:27:40] <head8debian> My grandpa has one from when he was 12 thats still running. :) And he is 80.
[2015/11/07 10:27:42] <leyyin> how can a tractor not run for 498 days?
[2015/11/07 10:28:08] <head8debian> Tractors don't go by the amount of miles on them, they go by hours on them.
[2015/11/07 10:28:27] <leyyin> what?
[2015/11/07 10:28:27] <head8debian> 6,000 hours on a Combine is alot.
[2015/11/07 10:28:41] <leyyin> how do they measure that?
[2015/11/07 10:29:02] <head8debian> We have a Skytrak with 12,000 hours and its its startign to show its age.
[2015/11/07 10:29:11] <head8debian> leyyin: Every tractor has a time meter...
[2015/11/07 10:29:19] <head8debian> Well, newer ones...
[2015/11/07 10:29:24] <leyyin> I do not think I saw that kind of thing here tbh
[2015/11/07 10:29:27] <head8debian> after 1980. ;)
[2015/11/07 10:30:02] <head8debian> We run relatively modern equipment because of reliabilty reasons and size.
[2015/11/07 10:30:21] <head8debian> Mdern as within the last 20 years.
[2015/11/07 10:30:46] <head8debian> You cannot cover hundreds of acres with a old "put put". :)
[2015/11/07 10:31:04] <head8debian> Wait, your not in the USA, so you wouldn't understand that reference...
[2015/11/07 10:31:16] <head8debian> leyyin: Whats the most popular tractor over ther?
[2015/11/07 10:31:20] <head8debian> there*
[2015/11/07 10:32:17] <mt> The average european is probably not interested in the popularity of tractors...

[2015/11/07 14:22:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: What kind of sponsor do you mean?
[2015/11/07 14:22:49] <Tobbi> Karkus, a VPS, probably? Something we can do automatic nightly builds on.
[2015/11/07 14:23:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: But someone has to pay for it.
[2015/11/07 14:23:25] <Tobbi> Karkus, Not if the company finds the cause worthwhile.
[2015/11/07 14:23:26] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/07 14:23:30] <Karkus> Unless you mean get an actual sponsor of supertux
[2015/11/07 14:23:39] <Tobbi> I mean: We're an open-source projects, we should be able to get someone to pay for the server.
[2015/11/07 14:23:40] <Tobbi> right?
[2015/11/07 14:24:49] <Tobbi> That's something we could need donations for.
[2015/11/07 14:25:19] <mt> With cross-compiling we could also try to get sponsors for this https://www.scaleway.com/pricing/ (don't forget VAT in EU)
[2015/11/07 14:26:58] <Tobbi> mt, Can you ask around?
[2015/11/07 14:27:12] <mt> Not sure who to ask, tbh
[2015/11/07 14:27:28] <Tobbi> mt, I mean: Ask around whether they'd let us set that up for free? We'd of course link back to them from supertux.github.io
[2015/11/07 14:27:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: You could use my server. :D
[2015/11/07 14:27:33] <Tobbi> Could give them some recognition.
[2015/11/07 14:27:38] <Tobbi> head8debian, For cross-compiling?
[2015/11/07 14:27:41] <Tobbi> head8debian, How good is it?
[2015/11/07 14:27:49] <head8debian> Well, not real good.
[2015/11/07 14:27:55] <head8debian> dual core 2.2ghz IIRC.
[2015/11/07 14:28:11] <Tobbi> head8debian, Problem is uploading stuff with your bandwidth.
[2015/11/07 14:28:15] <Tobbi> I believe.
[2015/11/07 14:28:16] <Tobbi> Right?
[2015/11/07 14:28:30] <mt> You'd not need cross-compilation on x86_64 machines, that server I linked to needs it because it's ARM
[2015/11/07 14:28:38] <head8debian> It would take a few mins.
[2015/11/07 14:29:03] <mt> Also, Online SAS is a rather big company, I'd expect more support from smaller hosting companies
[2015/11/07 14:29:09] <head8debian> But i don't care so much about upload speeds. Down is more annoying.

[2015/11/07 14:30:37] <head8debian> It does have 2gb ram.
[2015/11/07 14:30:47] <mt> Because that server's cheaper; you can cross-compile
[2015/11/07 14:31:28] <head8debian> Im not sure if it has ECC ram or non ECC ram.
[2015/11/07 14:31:28] <mt> You know that cross-compiling is for compiling code on an architecture different from the target architecture.
[2015/11/07 14:31:38] <head8debian> Yes i do...
[2015/11/07 14:32:08] <head8debian> But why do we need to cross compile?
[2015/11/07 14:32:20] <Tobbi> So that people from other OSes can get nightly builds as well?
[2015/11/07 14:32:26] <Tobbi> *using other OSes
[2015/11/07 14:32:38] <head8debian> Well, i could see 32 bit and 64 bit, but say x64-86 to ARM?
[2015/11/07 14:32:49] <mt> Nah, because if we'd build natively for ARM no-one could run the builds
[2015/11/07 14:33:22] <mt> If we cross-compile on ARM for x86_64 and i686, then you could run the binaries on "normal" computers
[2015/11/07 14:33:27] <head8debian> I could handle a couple uploads, but not more than 500mb a night.
[2015/11/07 14:34:11] <mt> Also, head8debian, why do you care about ECC? Even most x86_64 basic-level dedicated servers don't have ECC RAM.
[2015/11/07 14:34:31] <Tobbi> head8debian, The binaries shouldn't exceed 500 MB
[2015/11/07 14:34:37] <Tobbi> Maybe 250 in total or something.
[2015/11/07 14:34:39] <head8debian> Because, i could upgrade the ram if its non ECC. ;)
[2015/11/07 14:34:52] <head8debian> I haven't done any looking into the ram it has atm...
[2015/11/07 14:35:07] <head8debian> I got a mobo-cpu-ram combo and just instaleld it and started using it.
[2015/11/07 14:35:18] <mt> That server I linked to is using an ARM SoC, you can't replace RAM on SoCs.
[2015/11/07 14:35:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: But do we really *need* nightly builds?
[2015/11/07 14:35:32] <head8debian> mt: I do know what a SOC is. :)
[2015/11/07 14:35:45] <Tobbi> head8debian, No, we don't. But weekly builds could be neat.
[2015/11/07 14:36:03] <mt> head8debian: Yet you can't send them your RAM to add it.
[2015/11/07 14:36:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: But what if our development goes dead after M2 is released? :)
[2015/11/07 14:36:24] <head8debian> mt: True...
[2015/11/07 14:36:32] <head8debian> But 2gb ram can do quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:36:38] <head8debian> Not alot, but quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:36:57] <mt> As I said, I can build packaged x86_64 Arch Linux binaries manually once every week.
[2015/11/07 14:36:59] <Tobbi> head8debian, It certainly will.
[2015/11/07 14:37:21] <Tobbi> mt, Can't you cross-compile?
[2015/11/07 14:37:37] <head8debian> mt: I can to. :)
[2015/11/07 14:37:41] <mt> Cross-compile for what
[2015/11/07 14:37:47] <head8debian> mt: Arch packages are easy.
[2015/11/07 14:37:51] <Tobbi> mt, Cross-compile for win32 at least?
[2015/11/07 14:38:08] <Tobbi> Mac might be a problem.
[2015/11/07 14:38:09] <mt> Do we even support building using MinGW?
[2015/11/07 14:38:17] <head8debian> mt: I flagged the Supertux AUR package out of date, but haven't heard back. I even linked them to a updated version of it.
[2015/11/07 14:38:18] <Tobbi> afaik, we do.
[2015/11/07 14:38:55] <head8debian> Well, i would have more ram free if red_bot wasn't taking 250mb. o_O
[2015/11/07 14:38:58] <Tobbi> http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Building_on_Windows says we do with MSYS and MinGW
[2015/11/07 14:39:01] * head8debian stares at red_bot...
[2015/11/07 14:39:11] <Tobbi> red_bot stares back and wonders...
[2015/11/07 14:39:16] <Tobbi> Okay, guys, see you later.
[2015/11/07 14:39:21] <Tobbi> or rather in a minute.

[2015/11/07 14:39:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: The only thing with building is that my CPU fan is noisy. :D
[2015/11/07 14:40:22] <mt> I know that, I have so many computers I could use as homeservers, but they're too noisy

[2015/11/07 14:41:51] <Tobbi_> This project's activity has gone up quite a bit.
[2015/11/07 14:42:43] <head8debian> mt: my server is the last computer i use currently thats noisy, thankfully. ;)
[2015/11/07 14:43:08] <mt> but: more activity -> more bugs -> more activity -> even more bugs -> /* repeat */ :(
[2015/11/07 14:43:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, i do have another computer that we could use for this... but i don't want to. Then my room would be super really noisy. :p
[2015/11/07 14:43:40] <head8debian> mt: True... but you cannot just live with bugs.
[2015/11/07 14:43:46] <Karkus> mt: But more people to fix bugs

[2015/11/07 14:44:21] <head8debian> Its a loop...
[2015/11/07 14:44:24] <Tobbi> but also resulting in the project being sustainable.
[2015/11/07 14:44:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: How've you got two unaffiliated quotes
[2015/11/07 14:44:26] <mt> and to introduce as well
[2015/11/07 14:44:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: Uh?
[2015/11/07 14:44:46] <Karkus> Tobbi: Tobbi_ is unaffiliated
[2015/11/07 14:44:52] <Karkus> OOps
[2015/11/07 14:44:53] <Tobbi> mt: Doesn't every big open source project have that problem?
[2015/11/07 14:44:54] <Karkus> cloaks
[2015/11/07 14:44:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: yup.
[2015/11/07 14:45:01] <Karkus> not quotes
[2015/11/07 14:45:03] <mt> Karkus: if you're talking about cloaks, they will always be set when you identify
[2015/11/07 14:45:10] <mt> regardless of the nicknames
[2015/11/07 14:45:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: I have no clue how i'd set up my server to build packages like that though... the upload wouldn't be so hard. My server runs debian btw.
[2015/11/07 14:45:38] <Karkus> mt: But you need to get a cloak for each one, and an account for each one
[2015/11/07 14:45:42] <mt> Tobbi: I guess not just every big open source project, every bigger software project
[2015/11/07 14:45:51] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/11/07 14:45:52] <head8debian> Karkus: No, you group the nicks to your account.
[2015/11/07 14:45:57] <mt> Karkus: nope, you can sign in to the same account multiple times
[2015/11/07 14:46:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: Cronjob?
[2015/11/07 14:46:06] <mt> You don't even need to group nicks
[2015/11/07 14:46:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: Of course cronjob, but like to make a .deb file. ive heard they are a PITB.
[2015/11/07 14:46:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: You mean PITA? Yummy.

[2015/11/07 14:47:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: What OSes would i have to build for?
[2015/11/07 14:47:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Linux and maybe Windows. I believe, OS X is too hard to do.
[2015/11/07 14:47:53] <Karkus> head8debian: Solaris only
[2015/11/07 14:47:58] <Karkus> :D
[2015/11/07 14:48:01] <Tobbi> Solaris? urgh
[2015/11/07 14:48:10] <Karkus> I'm just kidding
[2015/11/07 14:48:19] <head8debian> mt: *should* a debian .deb work with ubuntu if its made properly?
[2015/11/07 14:48:23] <head8debian> Karkus: o_O
[2015/11/07 14:48:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: You'd have to transpile supertux into Java and create one JAR
[2015/11/07 14:48:33] <head8debian> I hate java...
[2015/11/07 14:48:37] <Karkus> head8debian: They do
[2015/11/07 14:48:42] <Tobbi> Java hates you as well.
[2015/11/07 14:48:50] <mt> Solaris, killall python :D
[2015/11/07 14:48:56] <head8debian> I use it as little as possible...
[2015/11/07 14:49:10] <Karkus> I used to like the language Java
[2015/11/07 14:49:22] <Karkus> But it's incredibly frustrating
[2015/11/07 14:49:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: careful...my bachelor thesis program is written in Java.
[2015/11/07 14:49:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: How in the world do you make a windows executable? o_O
[2015/11/07 14:49:45] <Karkus> Correction - I love Java it's the best
[2015/11/07 14:49:49] <mt> head8debian: it might work, but even a proper deb package might not work as ubuntu is not binary compatible to debian
[2015/11/07 14:50:02] <head8debian> I don't even know how to compile 32 bit on 64 bit...
[2015/11/07 14:50:05] <Karkus> head8debian: It's a mystery to everyone
[2015/11/07 14:50:13] <head8debian> lol. :-)
[2015/11/07 14:50:49] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:50:54] <mt> same applies to debian releases, e.g. squeeze, wheezy, jessie and sid, as they use different library versions, which will just break (and yes, I'm adding squeeze to the list because it's still supported)
[2015/11/07 14:51:19] <head8debian> mt: Dont forget stretch... ;)
[2015/11/07 14:51:33] <mt> I don't like testing
[2015/11/07 14:51:50] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/07 14:51:51] <leyyin> Tobbi, I write my bachelor thesis in ocaml ;)

[2015/11/07 14:52:29] <leyyin> secret :P
[2015/11/07 14:52:42] @ Quit: darkbasic: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2015/11/07 14:52:52] <leyyin> conversion from some diagrams to a session logic format, so that it easy to generate code
[2015/11/07 14:53:06] <mt> head8debian: Because it doesn't really get security updates - (old(old))stable gets fast security updates as patches; sid/unstable gets fast security updates from the latest release but testing will have to wait for the package to be in sid for some time and therefore won't get fast security updates
[2015/11/07 14:53:20] <Tobbi> leyyin: Sounds complicated.
[2015/11/07 14:53:27] <leyyin> sounds ;)
[2015/11/07 14:53:34] <Tobbi> hmm okay...
[2015/11/07 14:53:40] <leyyin> everything is simple once you know it :D
[2015/11/07 14:53:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: Believe me, writing a rudimentary transpiler was easy... :P
[2015/11/07 14:54:09] <leyyin> :D
[2015/11/07 14:54:10] <Tobbi> Still, it was torn apart by one of the profs.
[2015/11/07 14:54:11] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:54:12] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do you get to choose your language?
[2015/11/07 14:54:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: My prof wanted me to use...uh...yacc for that...
[2015/11/07 14:55:00] <leyyin> haha, yacc
[2015/11/07 14:55:02] <Tobbi> Karkus: But he told me something about "Compiler compiler" and I was freaked out.
[2015/11/07 14:55:09] <leyyin> or lex :P
[2015/11/07 14:55:17] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I was like: No way on earth am I gonna use a compiler compiler. I'm gonna write my own thing.
[2015/11/07 14:55:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: O_o
[2015/11/07 14:55:31] <Tobbi> It would've been easier using yacc, I believe.
[2015/11/07 14:55:46] <Tobbi> But, who cares :D
[2015/11/07 14:56:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: What did you use in the end though?
[2015/11/07 14:56:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: I wrote a transpiler in Java.
[2015/11/07 14:56:32] <Karkus> Oh, yeah
[2015/11/07 14:56:34] <Tobbi> That uses a stack and a map.

[2015/11/07 14:56:58] <leyyin> you should have used that ^
[2015/11/07 14:57:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: Uses too much memory.
[2015/11/07 14:57:11] <Tobbi> Also, it's too hairy.
[2015/11/07 14:57:12] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 14:57:17] <leyyin> I have my last homework for my compilers course to use lex or yacc
[2015/11/07 14:57:22] <Tobbi> I am not a yacc-ophile.

[2015/11/07 14:57:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/07 15:00:21] <mt> why don't you use bison if you don't like yacc?

[2015/11/07 19:14:05] <Karkus> Who is darkbasic and why do they always quit and join?
[2015/11/07 19:22:34] <head8debian> Karkus: Ask him...
[2015/11/07 19:22:36] <head8debian> ;)
[2015/11/07 19:23:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: one of them quits, the other joins, it's so easy.
[2015/11/07 19:23:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: But why
[2015/11/07 19:23:51] <Karkus> hehe
[2015/11/07 19:24:23] <Tobbi> Karkus: You know those moments when you don't know whether you want to enter a room or leave it and are stuck in the doorframe? This is no different.
[2015/11/07 19:25:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: Silently jumping back and forth through the doorframe...
[2015/11/07 19:25:40] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2015/11/07 19:26:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's the problem on the big channels like #freenode, so many join/part messages you have no option but to silence them

[2015/11/07 22:15:49] <datahead8888> Tobbi, did you want tickets for the music level or dark level with sound cues ideas?
[2015/11/07 22:16:08] <Tobbi> datahead8888: Yes, please. Whether we implement those is a different thing.
[2015/11/07 22:16:14] <Tobbi> Currently, I am busy with college..
[2015/11/07 22:16:16] <Tobbi> And it's 4am
[2015/11/07 22:16:43] <datahead8888> Okay, I thought you had suggested tickets earlier
[2015/11/07 22:17:10] <datahead8888> I just know that these may stay open for a while, and you guys usually seem to try to get tickets closed quickly, though maybe âI overperceived that
[2015/11/07 22:18:20] <Tobbi> No, it's exactly what we try to do.
[2015/11/07 22:18:32] <head8debian> Hey Tobbi.

[2015/11/08 12:18:51] <mt> please noo
[2015/11/08 12:19:07] <mt> try to make vector images
[2015/11/08 12:19:47] <mt> OS X, for example, uses 1024x1024 for HiDPI when 512x512 would be used
[2015/11/08 12:20:04] <brmbrmcar> But vector is bad...
[2015/11/08 12:20:57] <mt> Why is vector bad?
[2015/11/08 12:21:49] <brmbrmcar> Because it will only really be good within a certain size range.
[2015/11/08 12:21:52] <mt> It's smaller and can be scaled up without limit
[2015/11/08 12:22:05] <head8debian> mt: I do love vectors, but i would need to redo tux from scratch, which i wasnt planning on doing. the bitmap trace tool is still not very good.
[2015/11/08 12:22:25] <head8debian> Cannot .png do something similar?
[2015/11/08 12:22:37] <brmbrmcar> It is useful in enlarging, but should be modified heavily.
[2015/11/08 12:23:07] <mt> brmbrmcar: that's because vector graphics show exactly what you told them. If you don't include details it may look ugly when big.
[2015/11/08 12:23:40] <brmbrmcar> I k-now.
[2015/11/08 12:24:02] <brmbrmcar> I think we should just use the on in the repository.
[2015/11/08 12:24:14] <brmbrmcar> It's way better than any others.

[2015/11/08 12:28:30] <mt> head8debian: you can also try writing the svg in a text editor

[2015/11/08 13:42:42] <brmbrmcar> Use that.
[2015/11/08 13:42:50] <brmbrmcar> Trial it now.
[2015/11/08 13:43:04] <brmbrmcar> I can test it after.
[2015/11/08 14:13:27] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ping!!!!! PING@!
[2015/11/08 14:13:32] <Tobbi> calm down.
[2015/11/08 14:13:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: what?
[2015/11/08 14:13:55] <head8debian> PedroCosta: Feel free to ask Tobbi What you need answers to. :)
[2015/11/08 14:14:05] <brmbrmcar> CTCP PING reply from Tobbi: 0.531 seconds
[2015/11/08 14:14:12] <Tobbi> Stop it.
[2015/11/08 14:14:33] <brmbrmcar> Only did it once!
[2015/11/08 14:15:37] <PedroCosta> Will do!
[2015/11/08 14:15:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: He is talking to me in PM...
[2015/11/08 14:16:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: And he is going to try to talk to you now...

[2015/11/08 14:18:35] <PedroCosta> Trying to do a SuperTux deployment diagram, and wanted to know the kind of connection the PC establishes to get those. And what it connects to (is it a webserver) ?
[2015/11/08 14:18:42] <PedroCosta> the addons and maps
[2015/11/08 14:18:56] <Tobbi> PedroCosta: It's a github repository that gets queried.

[2015/11/09 11:51:22] <Karkus> I managed (by accident) to get a profile with a map messed up like this. But your commit doesn't fix it, it just stops it from occurring
[2015/11/09 11:51:26] <Karkus> Which is better

[2015/11/09 11:53:00] <Tobbi> Yes, but maybe someone else will tell us when it reoccurs.
[2015/11/09 11:53:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: Precisely
[2015/11/09 11:53:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, testing all paths leading to the current position might be the correct way, though that would be much more difficult.

[2015/11/09 12:03:22] <mt> I already described that in the issues tho
[2015/11/09 12:04:11] <mt> That library-version issue is also what can happen when you upgrade systems partially

[2015/11/09 12:15:49] <Tobbi> good
[2015/11/09 12:16:16] <mt> What you described would be possible, but it's not really ok to install the library in a path where the user doesn't want it installed, without confirmation

[2015/11/09 12:18:52] <mt> what can be done to fix the version-related issue is versioning the library in the filename
[2015/11/09 12:18:55] <mt> like:
[2015/11/09 12:18:58] <mt> lrwxrwxrwx 1    24 Nov  2 23:28 /usr/lib/libavformat.so -> libavformat.so.56.40.101*
[2015/11/09 12:18:59] <Karkus> mt: But isn't there a better place that is more universal among the linux distros
[2015/11/09 12:19:00] <mt> lrwxrwxrwx 1    24 Nov  2 23:28 /usr/lib/libavformat.so.56 -> libavformat.so.56.40.101*

[2015/11/09 12:19:47] <mt> the right place would be /lib, but if the user says "install to prefix /a/b/c" then we shouldn't install something somewhere else

[2015/11/09 12:27:24] <Karkus> I'm thinking SuperTree
[2015/11/09 12:27:27] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/09 12:27:58] <Tobbi> SuperVelociraptor.

[2015/11/09 12:28:11] <Tobbi> Or something.

[2015/11/09 12:30:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: The changes I'm making in https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/184 are quickly becoming quite incompatible with the previous version. It's backwards compatible, but not foreward compatible
[2015/11/09 12:30:27] <Karkus> by which I mean it could screw people's configs

[2015/11/09 12:30:39] <Karkus> If they try to use an older version
[2015/11/09 12:30:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: You could always copy the file over if it exists in the old location?
[2015/11/09 12:30:51] <Tobbi> Or rather move it, don't kno.

[2015/11/09 12:31:20] <Tobbi> Okay, good!
[2015/11/09 12:31:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: but if someone decides they prefer 0.3.6 and go back, they'll lose their settings.
[2015/11/09 12:32:12] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2015/11/09 12:32:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, copying is not the same as moving, right?
[2015/11/09 12:32:34] <Tobbi> So, if you keep the old file...?
[2015/11/09 12:33:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Good idea. I'll use a 'profile' file to store the current profile.
[2015/11/09 12:33:45] <Tobbi> :-) alright
[2015/11/09 12:33:57] <Karkus> Then old 'config' can stick around
[2015/11/09 12:34:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: We just need to make sure that people don't mistakenly try to alter their old config.
[2015/11/09 12:36:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'll get it to add a comment warning that this is a 0.3.6 config file and is ignored by 0.4.0
[2015/11/09 12:36:37] <Tobbi> Sure! That sounds good. Hopefully it's not too complicated.

[2015/11/09 14:02:06] <Tobbi_> though I should probably add it.
[2015/11/09 14:02:08] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I didn't want to ping you :)

[2015/11/09 14:05:14] <Tobbi_> Karkus, It's alright... :P
[2015/11/09 14:05:27] <Tobbi_> Karkus, You know, sometimes I overload people with work, for the sake of doing it.
[2015/11/09 14:05:29] <Karkus> Tobbi_: Oh, haha
[2015/11/09 14:05:35] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I don't mind
[2015/11/09 14:05:51] <Tobbi_> Karkus, I do. Because I am rather worried about people getting overworked.
[2015/11/09 14:06:04] <Karkus> Tobbi_: I'm not overworked
[2015/11/09 14:06:17] <Karkus> We have a deadline, and it needs meeting
[2015/11/09 14:06:22] <Tobbi_> Karkus, I know, but it can get that way too fast when you're getting overinvolved. :-)
[2015/11/09 14:06:34] <Tobbi_> I know that from my Mozilla contributor days.
[2015/11/09 14:06:43] <Karkus> I can add it to my new todo list http://swapoff.org/devtodo.html
[2015/11/09 14:06:46] <Tobbi_> But it's good that you'll take a break when you feel like it ;)

[2015/11/10 12:18:37] <Hume2> Hello, head8debian!
[2015/11/10 12:19:07] <Hume2> Someone should exterminate Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 12:19:48] <head8debian> Hume2: Nah, just windows.
[2015/11/10 12:20:08] <head8debian> Microsoft hasdone some cool things.
[2015/11/10 12:21:09] <Hume2> Just wait 70 years until the copyright laws will run out.
[2015/11/10 12:21:48] <Hume2> I read what Windows 10 everything does. I just feel a big rage.
[2015/11/10 12:21:48] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:21:53] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/10 12:22:03] <head8debian> Karkus: o_O
[2015/11/10 12:22:18] <Karkus> head8debian: What?
[2015/11/10 12:22:42] @ Quit: alket: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[2015/11/10 12:23:00] <Hume2> When Windows10 spies all the computers, it should work vice-versa too.
[2015/11/10 12:23:34] <Karkus> head8debian:idk how we do the windows builds.
[2015/11/10 12:24:51] <head8debian> Karkus: Good question.
[2015/11/10 12:24:53] <head8debian> Hume2: :D
[2015/11/10 12:25:03] <Hume2> Karkus: Please don't. Windows is a spyware.
[2015/11/10 12:25:28] <head8debian> Windows is a pile of crud, but people use it, so we have to also.
[2015/11/10 12:25:41] <Hume2> No, we don't have to.
[2015/11/10 12:26:10] <Hume2> Yes, people are monkeys, even I am a monkey. Monkeys must do the same as the others.
[2015/11/10 12:26:40] <head8debian> We can support it, but it doesn't mean we have to use it ourselves. :)
[2015/11/10 12:27:00] <Hume2> Yes.
[2015/11/10 12:27:19] <Hume2> It needs to hack the camera to send some random faces.
[2015/11/10 12:27:29] <head8debian> I do use it, and what little i don't like...
[2015/11/10 12:27:34] <Hume2> Don't you know how to make a random face generator?
[2015/11/10 12:27:55] <head8debian> Ehm, no?
[2015/11/10 12:28:26] <Hume2> I think, messing up Microsoft's server with junk data could work.
[2015/11/10 12:28:34] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/10 12:28:57] <head8debian> How are you going to mess up their servers when they use linux? :p
[2015/11/10 12:29:07] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 12:29:36] <Hume2> Well, let's start milions virtual machines with windows 10.
[2015/11/10 12:29:54] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 264 seconds
[2015/11/10 12:30:04] <Hume2> Well, that's not a good idea.
[2015/11/10 12:30:14] <head8debian> It would take more like billions...
[2015/11/10 12:31:01] <Hume2> Do you think that they have any backups of that spy-data?
[2015/11/10 12:32:35] <Hume2> I read that a new type of viruses have been invited. They install your OS as a virtual machine, so you can't get that they are even on your computer. Any way.
[2015/11/10 12:34:37] <Hume2> They could then send fake data to the camera and keyboard.
[2015/11/10 12:35:31] <Hume2> ...but no idea how to make those viruses...
[2015/11/10 12:36:38] <brmbrmcar> Awesome hacks!
[2015/11/10 12:40:05] <brmbrmcar> On a Microsoft e-mail account, I think that you can change your name to a script, possibly accessing more scripts that could destroy the servers.
[2015/11/10 12:40:54] <Hume2> I guess that special characters are blocked, so that wouldn't work. However, it could be good if that worked.
[2015/11/10 12:43:17] <brmbrmcar> It allows all xharacters.
[2015/11/10 12:45:58] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I think that it just displays those characters, but they are saved another way.
[2015/11/10 12:47:10] <Hume2> Anyway, it would have to run that script somehow. And I don't think that their software is equiped to run the scripts from usernames.
[2015/11/10 12:48:31] @ bb010g joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:48:59] <head8debian> Just drop a bomb on one of their server rooms...
[2015/11/10 12:49:45] <Hume2> That works too, but it's quite too simple.
[2015/11/10 12:51:11] <Hume2> Anyway, when it sends the users' photos, it can measure the dimensions of their skull.
[2015/11/10 12:51:40] <brmbrmcar> I know it works to run scripts to make you an admin.
[2015/11/10 12:51:55] <Hume2> So they know, what race you are and where you live. Doesn't it resemble you anything?
[2015/11/10 12:52:39] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes, but some kind of boss must make you an admin. And there are tons of passwords.
[2015/11/10 12:53:48] <brmbrmcar> I mean, the develpors surely use some sort of GUI.
[2015/11/10 12:54:28] @ Karkus joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 12:54:41] <Hume2> Yes, that's it. You'd have to force a developer to make you an admin.
[2015/11/10 12:55:02] <brmbrmcar> I'll try and find a video of the hack.
[2015/11/10 12:56:32] <brmbrmcar> I cannot find it. Probably taken down.
[2015/11/10 13:00:00] <Hume2> Do you think that they could misuse the data to make a genocide?
[2015/11/10 13:01:03] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/10 13:01:09] <brmbrmcar> But they wouldn't.
[2015/11/10 13:01:48] <Hume2> Could we be sure?
[2015/11/10 13:03:45] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/10 13:03:59] <brmbrmcar> We need to destroy Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 13:04:11] <brmbrmcar> Before they destroy one of us.
[2015/11/10 13:04:39] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2015/11/10 13:05:08] <Hume2> It needs something easy and effective.
[2015/11/10 13:08:24] @ Wuzzy joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/10 13:09:06] <Hume2> What about funny wideos with anti-Windows theme? Can it ever become popular?
[2015/11/10 13:12:12] <Hume2> What about a new SuperTux sign with crossed Windows logo?
[2015/11/10 13:12:34] <brmbrmcar> Supertux logo!
[2015/11/10 13:12:47] <brmbrmcar> No Apple builds either.
[2015/11/10 13:13:01] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: We need Tobbi though
[2015/11/10 13:14:50] <Hume2> I like those anti-Windowsish memes, they are so funny!
[2015/11/10 13:15:49] <Hume2> Automatic updates on Windows 8: Changing shape, don't turn off the computer.
[2015/11/10 13:16:17] <Hume2> Widows 8 causes the global warming.
[2015/11/10 13:16:38] <brmbrmcar> It certainally contributes to it.
[2015/11/10 13:17:54] <Hume2> Windows 8 needs a bazilion of ventilators to don't melt.
[2015/11/10 13:18:49] <brmbrmcar> Windows 8 overheats computers.
[2015/11/10 13:18:52] <Hume2> One pin of procesor has melted down. If not, correct it.
[2015/11/10 13:19:36] <Hume2> Your RAM is not supprted. Try DDR6 or newer.
[2015/11/10 13:24:10] <brmbrmcar> Please make this freezer colder.
[2015/11/10 13:25:44] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:28:30] <brmbrmcar> My laptop is fanless and has never overheated.
[2015/11/10 13:28:53] <brmbrmcar> Windows computers overheat in Antarctica.
[2015/11/10 13:28:58] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:29:31] <Hume2> Is it allowed to stick anti-Windowsish memes on the streats?
[2015/11/10 13:30:49] <brmbrmcar> Maybe.

[2015/11/10 13:31:55] <Hume2> It can't be a comparing ad, so there can't be any advertisement to any other system.
[2015/11/10 13:32:58] <brmbrmcar> How about advertise Windows, but make it bad?
[2015/11/10 13:33:42] <Hume2> Yes, like an ad, that will freak out more likely.
[2015/11/10 13:34:01] <brmbrmcar> Like Windows 10. Want to be hacked?
[2015/11/10 13:34:11] <Hume2> :D
[2015/11/10 13:34:50] <Hume2> Or something that will not metion that it's about Windows, but still freaking out of it.
[2015/11/10 13:35:13] <Hume2> For example, there will be "Blindous 10" instead of "Windows 10".
[2015/11/10 13:35:32] <brmbrmcar> HP Stream. The 200 euro brick.
[2015/11/10 13:35:42] <Hume2> What's that?
[2015/11/10 13:36:25] <brmbrmcar> It is a cheap Chromebook competitor that runs Windows.

[2015/11/10 14:10:40] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Do you know personally anyone who tells that Windows 10 is good?
[2015/11/10 14:11:44] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Only kids like Windows 10.
[2015/11/10 14:11:55] <brmbrmcar> And Microsoft.
[2015/11/10 14:12:21] <Hume2> Just find someone who will stick those things across the streats.
[2015/11/10 14:13:04] <brmbrmcar> Easy.
[2015/11/10 14:13:28] <Hume2> Narre could do that :D
[2015/11/10 14:13:55] <Hume2> Don't ever tell him that I mentioned him, he doesn't like it.
[2015/11/10 14:14:17] <Hume2> Sometimes at night...
[2015/11/10 14:14:32] <Hume2> And watch out the hidden cameras.
[2015/11/10 14:16:37] <brmbrmcar> If he did it carefully, he could probably do it in a blindspot.
[2015/11/10 14:17:20] <Hume2> If I was sure that noone could see me, I'd do it.
[2015/11/10 14:19:26] <Hume2> I could stick some to the bus stops those are already sticked by many stuff.
[2015/11/10 14:20:05] <brmbrmcar> I was thinking of bus stops.
[2015/11/10 14:21:53] <Hume2> Do you think that it could have any effect?
[2015/11/10 14:22:02] <brmbrmcar> Possibly.
[2015/11/10 14:22:11] <Hume2> Same for me.
[2015/11/10 14:22:59] <brmbrmcar> Maybe if it was very high quality, people wouldn't take it as much of a joke.
[2015/11/10 14:23:19] <brmbrmcar> And at the bottom write on legal stuff.
[2015/11/10 14:24:26] <Hume2> Yes. I think that there should be also someting that is called "Blindous 10". I could be really whatever, even an application that throws an error and closes.
[2015/11/10 14:24:46] <Hume2> And it must be for free.
[2015/11/10 14:25:18] <brmbrmcar> Open source.
[2015/11/10 14:25:35] <Hume2> Why not?
[2015/11/10 14:26:52] <brmbrmcar> Indeed.
[2015/11/10 14:28:57] <Hume2> Well, is there something that it could contain in addition?
[2015/11/10 14:30:54] <Hume2> I think that the people should notice it, so I wouldn't add much detail.
[2015/11/10 14:32:26] <Hume2> Is there a possibility that it would be in TV?
[2015/11/10 14:32:41] <brmbrmcar> How much does it cost?
[2015/11/10 14:34:09] <Hume2> Well, it costs one piece of paper and some glue. Not much.

[2015/11/11 11:42:30] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: So why the level andrews_island_level6.stl has a castle background?
[2015/11/11 11:42:40] <brmbrmcar> Will fix.
[2015/11/11 11:42:57] <brmbrmcar> I also noticed a couple of things I forgot.
[2015/11/11 11:43:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: ;( My neighbor down the road has 10mb/s internet. And im stuck on 3 with a unreliable ISP. :( :p
[2015/11/11 11:43:01] <maths22> Also, I have discovered my RPM build does nto work
[2015/11/11 11:43:08] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:43:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Ask them to upgrade you.
[2015/11/11 11:43:25] <maths22> Tobbi: what version of OSX are you on?
[2015/11/11 11:43:47] <Tobbi> maths22: 10.11.1
[2015/11/11 11:44:13] <maths22> OK.  That actually may be why it doesn't work
[2015/11/11 11:44:27] <maths22> I'll see if I can test/debug on a machine with El Capitan
[2015/11/11 11:45:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, they wouldn't because the person with the tower chose their most expensive plan. :D
[2015/11/11 11:45:42] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh? :D
[2015/11/11 11:45:44] <Tobbi> I see.
[2015/11/11 11:45:56] <head8debian> $120/month...
[2015/11/11 11:46:49] <head8debian> I have better upload speeds then them yet though. :D
[2015/11/11 11:47:37] <maths22> Tobbi: What kind of error do you get?
[2015/11/11 11:49:02] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: the level 5 was unlaunchable, so I corrected it.
[2015/11/11 11:49:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: And i suposably have a bandwidth cap which ive never seen implemented when ive gone 5 times over it...
[2015/11/11 11:49:20] <Tobbi> maths22: you can't open the application because it may be damaged or incomplete
[2015/11/11 11:49:28] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:49:40] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You can edit the infoblock's message by editor. It's called "edit script", but it's the message in fact.
[2015/11/11 11:49:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: roughtly 100gb. :p
[2015/11/11 11:49:53] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 11:50:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't have a bandwidth cap, fortunately.
[2015/11/11 11:50:06] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: I k-now.
[2015/11/11 11:50:08] <head8debian> :)
[2015/11/11 11:50:16] <maths22> Tobbi: see http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/58086
[2015/11/11 11:50:19] <brmbrmcar> How do you change the font though?
[2015/11/11 11:50:33] <maths22> Do you have that set to Anywhere, or something else?
[2015/11/11 11:50:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: Your a city slicker... i live in the middle of knowwhere, 10 miles from decent internet. Ok, more like 3. :p
[2015/11/11 11:50:42] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You put the formating char to the begining.
[2015/11/11 11:50:52] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: # stands for normal text.
[2015/11/11 11:50:58] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/11 11:51:07] <brmbrmcar> Didn't know that.
[2015/11/11 11:51:15] * head8debian should just start running fiber from house to house out here... then set up a cache server...
[2015/11/11 11:51:20] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: - stands for big text, space is small text and tab is blue text.
[2015/11/11 11:51:51] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: ! stands for image and any other char is black text.
[2015/11/11 11:53:22] <Tobbi> maths22: Hmm, supertux opens just fine when I double-click on the contained executable.
[2015/11/11 11:53:37] <maths22> That is what I expected
[2015/11/11 11:53:48] <maths22> It is a silly OS X security issue type of thing
[2015/11/11 11:53:57] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: For the level 5, it's nice. Just take a look at note 5 or 4. You can just add some poles so the wood won't levitate.
[2015/11/11 11:54:08] <Tobbi> maths22: No, the issue is still there, even if I disable that thingy from above.
[2015/11/11 11:54:22] <maths22> Tobbi: I figured
[2015/11/11 11:55:18] <maths22> I'll try to fix that this afternoon
[2015/11/11 11:56:00] <maths22> I also need to change linux so it includes the libraries in the package
[2015/11/11 11:56:39] <Tobbi> maths22: So, do you know what's wrong then?
[2015/11/11 11:57:20] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: level6, We have a cave background, even a cave music, so you can use it.
[2015/11/11 11:57:32] <maths22> Not sure, but since it is not an El Capitan specifc issue, I should be able to debug it
[2015/11/11 11:57:56] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/11 11:59:04] <maths22> Can you try editing the Info.plist so that CFBundleExecutable is SuperTux and not supertux2?
[2015/11/11 12:00:00] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: For level6, take a look at notes 4, 5, 6, 14 and 31.
[2015/11/11 12:00:43] <Tobbi> maths22: 11.11.15 17:58:06,159 lsd[367]: LaunchServices: Could not store lsd-identifiers file at /private/var/db/lsd/com.apple.lsdschemes.plist
[2015/11/11 12:00:48] <Tobbi> That's what I get.
[2015/11/11 12:00:53] <Tobbi> Not sure if it helps you in any way.
[2015/11/11 12:02:33] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: OK.
[2015/11/11 12:03:29] <maths22> Tobbi: thanks.  I'll take a look later on my school's machines
[2015/11/11 12:03:34] <Tobbi> Sure.

[2015/11/11 12:28:39] <maths22> Ideally, more of our version numbers would be in the same place (so we don't have to go tracking each of them down to update the version)

[2015/11/11 12:45:43] <Tobbi> Apparently I didn't exceed the character count.
[2015/11/11 12:45:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: what_
[2015/11/11 12:45:46] <Tobbi> ?
[2015/11/11 12:46:31] <head8debian> Im tryign to set up squid with 2 ethernet cards and nano... :p
[2015/11/11 12:46:33] <mt> no https (or at least hashes) for the nightly builds?
[2015/11/11 12:46:56] <Tobbi> ask maths22
[2015/11/11 12:47:18] <mt> next week you'll have no execuse for not supporting TLS (https://letsencrypt.org/) :P
[2015/11/11 12:47:55] <Tobbi> great!
[2015/11/11 12:51:35] <brmbrmcar> maths22: How do I install the linux tar.gz file?
[2015/11/11 12:53:50] <Tobbi> maths22, head8debian, Karkus, mt: What do you guys think? http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=6630
[2015/11/11 12:55:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: Great!
[2015/11/11 12:55:59] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 12:56:04] <Tobbi> So there's that.
[2015/11/11 12:56:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: The only thing on that list which has remained unaffected by this project is my cat
[2015/11/11 12:56:50] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 12:58:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: If I had a cat, I believe, I'd try Schroedinger's experiment with it.
[2015/11/11 12:58:47] <Tobbi> So, it's good that I don't have one.
[2015/11/11 12:58:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah
[2015/11/11 12:59:13] <Karkus> Probably
[2015/11/11 12:59:48] <Karkus> Not a very interesting experiment really though is it Tobbi?
[2015/11/11 13:00:09] <Karkus> Outcomes 1) Cat ded 2) Cat live
[2015/11/11 13:00:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: Not as interesting as the Babies-in-the-dishwasher experiment. Exactly!
[2015/11/11 13:00:42] <Tobbi> While the babies-in-the-dishwasher experiment has a multitude of different outcomes, fractures, amount of blood etc.
[2015/11/11 13:01:03] <Karkus> And all of them are super exciting!
[2015/11/11 13:01:26] <Tobbi> For sure!
[2015/11/11 13:01:37] <brmbrmcar> Poor babies.
[2015/11/11 13:03:34] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: No, wrong. Poor dishwasher, rather.
[2015/11/11 13:03:36] <Karkus> Well, older rich people don't submit themse as willing volunteers
[2015/11/11 13:03:43] <Karkus> themselves*
[2015/11/11 13:06:29] <brmbrmcar> How about my method of harming babies?
[2015/11/11 13:06:36] <brmbrmcar> No restraint.
[2015/11/11 13:06:39] <brmbrmcar> Crash!
[2015/11/11 13:08:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: You, know what's best about nightly builds?
[2015/11/11 13:09:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: what?

[2015/11/11 13:09:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: good? I think that's a bad thing :D
[2015/11/11 13:09:44] <Tobbi> Meaning more bugs for all of us.
[2015/11/11 13:09:50] <Tobbi> But wait, we had that topic, already.
[2015/11/11 13:10:16] <brmbrmcar> Bugs are good.

[2015/11/11 13:15:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Shall I close it?
[2015/11/11 13:15:17] <mt> maths22: please - try to link the linux binaries statically, else it will break on distros that don't use the same library versions as the build system's distro
[2015/11/11 13:15:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: You could. I wonder how often maths22 is willing to build these, but, yeah, go ahead.
[2015/11/11 13:16:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: Manually built?
[2015/11/11 13:16:10] <mt> maths22: like "games/supertux2: error while loading shared libraries: libGLEW.so.1.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory", I'm already using glew-1.13.0
[2015/11/11 13:16:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Oh, I mean "trigger a build", afaik he still has to do it.
[2015/11/11 13:16:41] <brmbrmcar> ./supertux2: error while loading shared libraries: libtinygettext.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[2015/11/11 13:17:00] <mt> brmbrmcar: yeah that's because it's not statically linked
[2015/11/11 13:17:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, it can't be considered a nightly release then...
[2015/11/11 13:17:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: hmm, right....but maybe he is willing to build them every day.
[2015/11/11 13:17:35] <mt> Karkus: well, you can write a cronjob triggering it every night
[2015/11/11 13:17:55] <Tobbi> I could've labeled them developer releases, but that would be confusing.
[2015/11/11 13:18:00] <brmbrmcar> mt:So what do I have to do?
[2015/11/11 13:18:25] <mt> brmbrmcar: wait until the builds are statically linked
[2015/11/11 13:18:54] <brmbrmcar> What can I do in the meantime? Do i have to build tinygettext?
[2015/11/11 13:19:02] <Karkus> mt: But does he want to? (or rather will he?)
[2015/11/11 13:19:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah, not that
[2015/11/11 13:19:50] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Why do you depend on developer releases. You know how to build supertux, don't you?
[2015/11/11 13:20:20] <brmbrmcar> Not really.
[2015/11/11 13:20:37] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You never built supertux yourself?
[2015/11/11 13:20:39] <brmbrmcar> I don't know how to build sdl 2.03.
[2015/11/11 13:20:48] <brmbrmcar> I used the ppa.
[2015/11/11 13:20:48] <Tobbi> Do you need to build it?
[2015/11/11 13:20:54] <Tobbi> So, where's the problem?
[2015/11/11 13:20:55] <brmbrmcar> On Ubuntu.
[2015/11/11 13:21:07] <brmbrmcar> All sorts of bugs.
[2015/11/11 13:21:20] <brmbrmcar> And this was on my previous Ubuntu install.
[2015/11/11 13:21:22] <mt> Building on Ubuntu works just fine
[2015/11/11 13:21:35] <mt> Travis builds are running on ubuntu
[2015/11/11 13:21:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe we should assemble a WIP release notes document.
[2015/11/11 13:21:53] <Tobbi> And make it organization-visible only for now.
[2015/11/11 13:22:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: On Google docs for example?
[2015/11/11 13:22:21] <Karkus> Or what and how?
[2015/11/11 13:22:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: I wonder if Github allows you to do secret wiki pages?
[2015/11/11 13:22:28] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/11 13:22:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Secret gist?
[2015/11/11 13:22:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: I like this idea very much.
[2015/11/11 13:22:54] <Tobbi> That might work!
[2015/11/11 13:23:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: It doesn't have to be secret...
[2015/11/11 13:23:24] <Tobbi> Sure, I just don't want people to assume this is an actual release right now.
[2015/11/11 13:23:30] <Tobbi> So, yeah, indeed, there's nothing secret about it.
[2015/11/11 13:24:22] <brmbrmcar> So I can't see it!
[2015/11/11 13:25:06] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What?
[2015/11/11 13:25:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Are you drafting the gist or shall I?
[2015/11/11 13:25:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: How do I create a gist as SuperTux?
[2015/11/11 13:25:32] <Tobbi> Ah, one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:25:34] <brmbrmcar> I won't be able to see it!
[2015/11/11 13:25:44] <brmbrmcar> It is a secret.
[2015/11/11 13:25:58] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: We'll see.
[2015/11/11 13:26:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: Having a secret gist would be a little complex
[2015/11/11 13:26:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, anyone with the url could see it
[2015/11/11 13:26:38] <Karkus> but the URL wouldn't have to be publiv
[2015/11/11 13:26:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: There doesn't seem to be any way to create a gist as an organization.
[2015/11/11 13:27:13] <Tobbi> https://gist.github.com/tobbi/c9fd5380aed73ce4bb82
[2015/11/11 13:27:18] <Tobbi> Wonder if you can access it and edit it.
[2015/11/11 13:28:22] <brmbrmcar> I can see it.
[2015/11/11 13:28:28] <Tobbi> Yes, but editing...
[2015/11/11 13:28:41] <Tobbi> actually, one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:28:46] <mt> I wonder if forking as organization would work
[2015/11/11 13:28:49] <brmbrmcar> Not editing.
[2015/11/11 13:28:58] <Karkus> Nope.
[2015/11/11 13:30:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: Damn.
[2015/11/11 13:30:31] <Tobbi> one moment, I'll find a way...
[2015/11/11 13:30:32] <brmbrmcar> I forked it.
[2015/11/11 13:30:33] <Tobbi> an etherpad, or something.
[2015/11/11 13:30:39] <brmbrmcar> And could edit.
[2015/11/11 13:30:48] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Won't help.
[2015/11/11 13:31:21] <brmbrmcar> I k-now.

[2015/11/11 13:33:41] <leyyin> Tobbi, your document is getting vandalized
[2015/11/11 13:33:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: By you?
[2015/11/11 13:34:03] <leyyin> I only added "Woohooo"
[2015/11/11 13:34:07] <Tobbi> gargh
[2015/11/11 13:34:11] <Tobbi> Let's try the wiki.
[2015/11/11 13:34:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: I added git shortlog v0.3.5..HEAD
[2015/11/11 13:34:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: I just wondered if it worked
[2015/11/11 13:34:35] <Tobbi> Aka, all commits since v0.3.5a
[2015/11/11 13:34:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, all the git commits
[2015/11/11 13:34:41] <Tobbi> oh!
[2015/11/11 13:34:41] <Karkus> Okay
[2015/11/11 13:34:43] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2015/11/11 13:34:47] <Tobbi> Wrong version.
[2015/11/11 13:35:04] <mt> can '^Merge pull request #.*' be excluded
[2015/11/11 13:35:20] <brmbrmcar> I think so.
[2015/11/11 13:35:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: You can stop it getting vandalised by just anyone can you not?
[2015/11/11 13:35:30] <Tobbi> I could
[2015/11/11 13:35:36] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe we should use the wiki, though.
[2015/11/11 13:35:40] <Tobbi> Now that I think about it.
[2015/11/11 13:35:47] <Karkus> I typed the newlines. But they're gone now
[2015/11/11 13:35:51] <Tobbi> Anyone here who does not have a wiki account?
[2015/11/11 13:36:03] <Karkus> Err... Me I think.
[2015/11/11 13:36:06] <Karkus> Let me check
[2015/11/11 13:36:27] <brmbrmcar> Done.
[2015/11/11 13:36:38] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: done what?
[2015/11/11 13:37:59] <brmbrmcar> Removed merge pull requests.

[2015/11/11 13:46:44] <mt> ok
[2015/11/11 13:47:23] <maths22> Also, once it is integrated into the offical repos, it should be triggered by a push
[2015/11/11 13:47:46] <Tobbi> maths22: How often will you trigger builds?
[2015/11/11 13:48:40] <maths22> Tobbi: once everything is working, there will be a set of pull requests (to tinygettext, squirrel, and supertux)
[2015/11/11 13:48:47] <maths22> After that, it will run on every commit
[2015/11/11 13:49:05] <maths22> it uses travis to handle the OS X and Linux builds
[2015/11/11 13:49:10] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 13:49:16] <maths22> AppVeyor is used to handle Windows
[2015/11/11 13:49:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: Mediawiki is great! It doesn't allow me to change a password for a user without access to a database.
[2015/11/11 13:49:42] <Tobbi> It only allows me to send a password reset email :D
[2015/11/11 13:50:10] <maths22> Also, I think I may change the upload name to include the commit hash (and only keep tags and the 10 most recent or something like that)
[2015/11/11 13:50:18] <maths22> I also need to fix the OSX icon
[2015/11/11 13:51:23] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: What's wrong with that?

[2015/11/11 13:52:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: PM
[2015/11/11 13:55:31] <leyyin> maths22, any documentation on how you did the builds on travis? :D
[2015/11/11 13:57:40] <Tobbi> Oh! AppVeyor is free for opensource apps...
[2015/11/11 13:57:41] <Tobbi> Great!
[2015/11/11 13:58:43] <brmbrmcar> Free!
[2015/11/11 13:59:03] <head8debian> Yay! Polipo! :p
[2015/11/11 13:59:26] <brmbrmcar> Celebrate!
[2015/11/11 13:59:32] <brmbrmcar> :)
[2015/11/11 13:59:47] <Tobbi> We could actually assemble a list of people who contributed and update the credits.
[2015/11/11 14:00:03] <Tobbi> If the number of contributions is > n where n is a positive integeer.
[2015/11/11 14:00:06] <Tobbi> *integer
[2015/11/11 14:00:22] <leyyin> 2^128
[2015/11/11 14:00:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Contributions is a fairly arbitrary unit, isn't it?
[2015/11/11 14:01:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yeah, indeed.
[2015/11/11 14:01:12] <maths22> leyyin: No documentation yet.  I can write some up once I have cleaned up my .travis.yml to be less ugly
[2015/11/11 14:01:56] <brmbrmcar> brmbrmcar Absolutely Nothing
[2015/11/11 14:02:07] <leyyin> ah, I found it, thanks maths22
[2015/11/11 14:03:39] <maths22> I also need to re-enable debug builds, etc, but only make these binaries for the release one
[2015/11/11 14:04:12] <maths22> Also, I think my branch only works in LLVM, so I need to fix that
[2015/11/11 14:04:24] <Tobbi> Hah! The overall number of my commits to SuperTux is 444
[2015/11/11 14:04:41] <leyyin> nice, I did not know about the apt addon in travis, TIL
[2015/11/11 14:04:58] <maths22> leyyin: it is relatively new
[2015/11/11 14:05:02] <Karkus> Mine should soon rise to 9
[2015/11/11 14:05:33] <maths22> also, SDL2 is only in the offical repos on 14.04, so I have it build on 14.04 so we don't need to build it ourselves
[2015/11/11 14:06:05] <Karkus> maths22 is it building automatically each day?
[2015/11/11 14:06:08] <Tobbi> maths22: Wait, travis allows you to build on 14.04 now?
[2015/11/11 14:06:27] <maths22> see https://github.com/maths22/supertux/blob/master/.travis.yml
[2015/11/11 14:06:32] <maths22> Karkus: not yet
[2015/11/11 14:06:51] <Tobbi> That is great!
[2015/11/11 14:06:57] <maths22> Once I have everything working and polished up, I will submit a pull request to the official repository, and this will hopefully get integrated in
[2015/11/11 14:07:01] <Tobbi> Sure, thanks!
[2015/11/11 14:07:15] <maths22> Karkus: then it will run with every push
[2015/11/11 14:07:17] <Tobbi> maths22: Does that add-on do deps caching? I assume no?
[2015/11/11 14:07:38] <maths22> Tobbi: no, but it runs pretty fast
[2015/11/11 14:07:42] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/11 14:07:53] <maths22> Builds (with packaging and uploads) take ~7 minutes
[2015/11/11 14:08:05] <Karkus> maths22: Every push!?
[2015/11/11 14:08:08] <maths22> https://travis-ci.org/maths22/supertux
[2015/11/11 14:08:13] <maths22> Karkus: yep!
[2015/11/11 14:08:22] <maths22> It just adds a step to the end of travis
[2015/11/11 14:08:53] <leyyin> and now you can do mac build too, hmm
[2015/11/11 14:08:56] <leyyin> windows too? :D
[2015/11/11 14:09:11] <maths22> leyyin: windows through AppVeyor
[2015/11/11 14:09:12] <Tobbi> Who cares about Windows? :P
[2015/11/11 14:09:32] <maths22> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maths22/supertux
[2015/11/11 14:09:33] <brmbrmcar> I don't.
[2015/11/11 14:09:39] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I was being ironic.
[2015/11/11 14:09:40] <brmbrmcar> Who cares about OSX?
[2015/11/11 14:09:46] <brmbrmcar> You.
[2015/11/11 14:09:51] <maths22> Tobbi: people who use Windows
[2015/11/11 14:09:55] <maths22> brmbrmcar: people who use OSX
[2015/11/11 14:09:56] <maths22> :)
[2015/11/11 14:10:00] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/11 14:10:11] <brmbrmcar> I use Linux
[2015/11/11 14:10:18] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I figured
[2015/11/11 14:10:48] <brmbrmcar> There is no good alternative apart from browser operating systems.
[2015/11/11 14:10:53] <Karkus> Who cares about Linux
[2015/11/11 14:10:57] <Karkus> :P
[2015/11/11 14:11:01] <Karkus> jk
[2015/11/11 14:11:28] <maths22> I also created a new dependency zip that includes the newest boot and VC14 boost libraries
[2015/11/11 14:11:39] <leyyin> maths22, so this is the only file you need for appveyor https://github.com/maths22/supertux/blob/master/appveyor.yml ?
[2015/11/11 14:11:52] <maths22> leyyin: yes
[2015/11/11 14:12:27] <maths22> It is nice and clean
[2015/11/11 14:12:31] <Tobbi> maths22: Could you package our final release as well? Or rather build a release build when we want to release?
[2015/11/11 14:12:54] <maths22> Tobbi: I will have it keep tagged builds (and not clean them up)
[2015/11/11 14:13:01] <maths22> It will also name tagged builds differently
[2015/11/11 14:13:03] <Tobbi> Great!
[2015/11/11 14:13:15] <maths22> (How that will work, I'm not yet sure, but I'll figure it out)
[2015/11/11 14:13:30] * leyyin takes notes for STK
[2015/11/11 14:13:33] <maths22> Tobbi: it also only packages the release one
[2015/11/11 14:13:58] <maths22> Also, can we assemble a list of everywhere we use the version number (or development state, like the main logo)
[2015/11/11 14:14:23] <Tobbi> yeah, we should do that.
[2015/11/11 14:15:54] <Tobbi> By the way, guys: http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Changelog_0.4.0_%28WIP%29
[2015/11/11 14:16:21] <Tobbi> Karkus, mt, head8debian, maths22, brmbrmcar ^^ if you want to contribute
[2015/11/11 14:17:00] <Tobbi> We would need to pick the most important changes and create releases notes from them.
[2015/11/11 14:17:16] <maths22> Do we know of anywhere besides CMakeLists.txt and data/images/objects/logo/logo.sprite
[2015/11/11 14:17:17] <Tobbi> I suggest we keep out the xmas stuff though, in order to keep them a surprise.
[2015/11/11 14:17:46] <Tobbi> CMakeLists.txt
[2015/11/11 14:17:53] <Tobbi> it uses patch levels etc.
[2015/11/11 14:17:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: So this isn't the actual file, just a draft of things which have been added?
[2015/11/11 14:18:05] <Karkus> To be developed into that.
[2015/11/11 14:18:11] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, exactly.
[2015/11/11 14:18:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: However, I intend to just move the file once it's ready and supertux is about to be released.
[2015/11/11 14:20:09] <maths22> Tobbi: for releases, we can actually use http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/
[2015/11/11 14:20:24] <maths22> Tobbi: they will then go straight into github
[2015/11/11 14:20:38] <maths22> I will mess with that feature later
[2015/11/11 14:21:20] <Tobbi> maths22: How would those be triggered? We just add tags?
[2015/11/11 14:21:46] <maths22> I believe so
[2015/11/11 14:22:04] <maths22> I'll investigate tonight
[2015/11/11 14:22:12] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/11 14:23:08] <leyyin> maths22, only the new containers are 14.04? not the old infrastructure
[2015/11/11 14:27:30] <leyyin> actually we can do windows cross compiling on linux, who needs windows anyways :P
[2015/11/11 14:27:41] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/11 14:27:47] <Tobbi> leyyin: well, I use it regularly...
[2015/11/11 14:29:18] <maths22> leyyin: i actually was going to cross-comple, but then I discovered appveyor
[2015/11/11 14:29:51] <leyyin> one problem I think it is, how you can upload the bundles securely to your file server
[2015/11/11 14:30:04] <leyyin> so that no one can hijack the upload, and upload something malicious
[2015/11/11 14:30:37] <maths22> the key will be changed and moved on an encrypted envvar

[2015/11/11 14:32:45] <maths22> it also doesnt populate them for pull requests, so a nalicious pull request cant hurt

[2015/11/11 14:56:18] <brmbrmcar> OK then.
[2015/11/11 14:59:15] <maths22> Tobbi: I also should add source tarballs (at least for tags)
[2015/11/11 14:59:24] <Tobbi> sounds good!
[2015/11/11 14:59:40] <maths22> Actually, github does that for us
[2015/11/11 14:59:42] <maths22> never mind that
[2015/11/11 15:02:33] <Tobbi> hmm.
[2015/11/11 15:05:03] <brmbrmcar> I looked through all the projects,
[2015/11/11 15:05:20] <brmbrmcar> How long has it been up for?

[2015/11/11 15:06:00] <maths22> s/notification/notifier/
[2015/11/11 15:06:00] <red_bot> maths22 meant: "Tobbi: is the notifier not in the github repo settings?"
[2015/11/11 15:06:23] <Tobbi> maths22: No, it's a webhook (called Notifico)
[2015/11/11 15:06:56] <maths22> OK.  I know GitHub has a decent one built in
[2015/11/11 15:07:06] <maths22> You could probably kill Notifico and enable it if you wanted to
[2015/11/11 15:07:17] <Tobbi> Yeah, or create my own Notifico account.

[2015/11/11 15:47:49] <brmbrmcar> Support what?
[2015/11/11 15:48:07] <brmbrmcar> Oh XP.
[2015/11/11 15:48:26] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/11 15:48:28] <brmbrmcar> Why?
[2015/11/11 15:48:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes.
[2015/11/11 15:48:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: And they have not made any moves to stop supporting it.
[2015/11/11 15:48:54] <Tobbi> Which is good. At least they did something right
[2015/11/11 15:50:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: :p
[2015/11/11 15:50:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: No one should be supporting xp...

[2015/11/11 15:50:25] <brmbrmcar> Do thay support Windows 1.0?
[2015/11/11 15:50:33] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: haha, no.
[2015/11/11 15:51:00] <head8debian> XP is just so crusty...
[2015/11/11 15:51:08] <brmbrmcar> Do they support Chrome OS?
[2015/11/11 15:51:16] <head8debian> I think debian Jessie is old. :p
[2015/11/11 15:51:27] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: I don't know. I doubt it.
[2015/11/11 15:52:03] <brmbrmcar> Soon all Android apps will work, so that means Firefox. :D
[2015/11/11 15:52:58] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Or chrome will merge with android. :)

[2015/11/11 17:03:02] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/11 17:05:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: Can we have multiplayer (on a single keyboard) as part of supertux 3?
[2015/11/11 17:05:38] <Tobbi> Sounds good. File an issue.
[2015/11/11 17:05:43] <Tobbi> We'd also need sprites...
[2015/11/11 17:05:51] <Tobbi> I mean: We need a different player sprite.
[2015/11/11 17:05:55] <Tobbi> and animations and everything.
[2015/11/11 17:05:56] <Karkus> ik
[2015/11/11 17:06:11] <Karkus> But I guess for now we could recolor tux in gimp
[2015/11/11 17:06:19] <Karkus> takes a couple seconds
[2015/11/11 17:06:50] <Tobbi> Possibly, sure.
[2015/11/11 17:07:04] <Tobbi> but since this is for SuperTux 3 anyway...
[2015/11/11 17:07:14] <Tobbi> Karkus: It'd mean split screen, right?
[2015/11/11 17:07:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: TBC
[2015/11/11 17:07:26] <Karkus> To Be Considered
[2015/11/11 17:07:31] <Karkus> In this sense
[2015/11/11 17:07:33] <Tobbi> sounds fun.
[2015/11/11 17:07:34] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 17:08:06] <Karkus> In the Mario games (I know I talk about these a lot) it's not split screen.
[2015/11/11 17:08:25] <Tobbi> I finally (!!) managed to update the add-on index.
[2015/11/11 17:08:27] <Karkus> Split screen would be infinity times harder to implement
[2015/11/11 17:08:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Index?
[2015/11/11 17:08:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: But if one player is faster than the other?
[2015/11/11 17:08:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: I added head8debian's worldmap changes for rubberduck
[2015/11/11 17:09:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: Then the slower gets crushed on the screen
[2015/11/11 17:09:12] <Tobbi> uhm...okay?
[2015/11/11 17:09:13] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/11 17:09:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Great! Can you now close the issue?
[2015/11/11 17:09:18] <Tobbi> Oh, of course.
[2015/11/11 17:09:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Have you really never played those games
[2015/11/11 17:09:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: To be honest, no! :D
[2015/11/11 17:09:40] <Karkus> New Super Mario Wii etc.

[2015/11/11 17:10:45] <Karkus> Tobbi: We could actually have many players if we used the game controllers
[2015/11/11 17:10:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: Do you own a game controller? :D
[2015/11/11 17:11:04] <Tobbi> Because I don't and thus can't test support for that.
[2015/11/11 17:11:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: I... don't know...
[2015/11/11 17:11:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: What *is* a game controller which is compatible?
[2015/11/11 17:11:38] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/11 17:12:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's an SDL thing isn't it?
[2015/11/11 17:12:26] <Tobbi> Karkus: indeed.
[2015/11/11 17:13:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have also been thinking about a website where people can submit their add-ons. We review them and we can auto-push them to the game.
[2015/11/11 17:13:53] <Tobbi> That would be fun.
[2015/11/11 17:13:56] <Tobbi> No more editing nfo files.

[2015/11/11 17:14:05] <Karkus> https://youtu.be/pipMu0HXiU0?t=50s
[2015/11/11 17:14:09] <Karkus> That one maybe
[2015/11/11 17:15:37] <Tobbi> Interesting.
[2015/11/11 17:15:44] <Tobbi> So, maybe not that hard to implement.
[2015/11/11 17:19:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: Playing with other people over the internet could be fun :D
[2015/11/11 17:19:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: It would, yes
[2015/11/11 17:20:34] <Karkus> I think we could have a huge leader board with top levels created by people all over the place
[2015/11/11 17:20:50] <Karkus> And then you can play them. Multiplayer, too
[2015/11/11 17:21:03] <Karkus> Compete for time or secrets etc.
[2015/11/11 17:21:04] <Tobbi> That would be great.
[2015/11/11 17:21:08] <Tobbi> But also alot of work.
[2015/11/11 17:21:14] <Tobbi> But maybe we'll get people to contribute after 0.4.0
[2015/11/11 17:21:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: No kidding
[2015/11/11 17:21:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: But that's a good thing for a roadmap.
[2015/11/11 17:22:40] <Karkus> Well, top priority after 0.4.0, for me at least, is flexlay. The problem is I think the code is too annoying. I'm not saying I could do better, but I think I could.
[2015/11/11 17:23:15] <Karkus> It's all a bit disorganised

[2015/11/11 17:33:44] <Tobbi> Some of the German translations are so...bad...
[2015/11/11 17:34:07] <Tobbi> "Take your pick" -> <translates as if someone would take an actual "pick">
[2015/11/11 17:34:15] <Tobbi> You know...ice pick for example.
[2015/11/11 17:36:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: tooth pick

[2015/11/12 10:22:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: We had a power outage all morning...
[2015/11/12 10:22:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: Including yourself?
[2015/11/12 10:23:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes?
[2015/11/12 10:24:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: No electric = cannot milk cows...
[2015/11/12 10:24:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: I know, cows don't work... Cows are a direct result of electricity...
[2015/11/12 10:24:51] <Tobbi> Actually, first the electricity, then the cow.
[2015/11/12 10:24:59] <Tobbi> Perfect symbioses.
[2015/11/12 10:25:03] <Tobbi> *symbiosis

[2015/11/12 10:25:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: We could milk them by hand, but its hard to do 100 cows by hand. :)
[2015/11/12 10:25:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: Have you ever sold forged harddisks and cholesterol?
[2015/11/12 10:25:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, no?
[2015/11/12 10:26:05] <Tobbi> alright.
[2015/11/12 10:26:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: And we have roughly 100,000 turkeys being fed around us also, which cannot be fed without electricity.
[2015/11/12 10:26:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: ever tried?
[2015/11/12 10:26:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: I notice that when you put a turkey in a hot stove (= electricity) it tasts better afterwards.
[2015/11/12 10:27:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: I'd rather cook it over a gas stove. :D
[2015/11/12 10:27:17] <head8debian> Much more eficient.
[2015/11/12 10:27:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Gas hasn't been invented yet around here.
[2015/11/12 10:28:18] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/12 10:29:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, basically, whenever we want to cook something, we have people who rotate sticks in order for hay to catch fire.
[2015/11/12 10:29:29] <Tobbi> or something.
[2015/11/12 10:29:41] <Tobbi> Because, we don't know how to deal with electricity.
[2015/11/12 10:29:46] <Tobbi> Sometimes it's there, sometimes it isn't.
[2015/11/12 10:29:55] <Tobbi> Sometimes it's too strong, sometimes it's too low.
[2015/11/12 10:30:10] <Tobbi> Sometimes it's an amoeba.
[2015/11/12 10:31:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm.
[2015/11/12 10:31:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: Us americans find it quite reliable. :D
[2015/11/12 10:32:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: says the one with a power outage.
[2015/11/12 10:32:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its back on now...
[2015/11/12 10:32:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: So twice a year it goes out for a couple hours.
[2015/11/12 10:33:12] <head8debian> It seems to be just with our electricity line.
[2015/11/12 10:33:25] <head8debian> the neighbors never lose electricity.
[2015/11/12 10:33:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Have you ever tried to stack cows on top of each other? In theory that should give you more energy, since there's more potential energy.

[2015/11/12 10:41:11] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 10:48:34] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/12 11:00:47] <mt> Tobbi: it was me who set up notifico, but when there's no option in the "Webhooks & services" section I can't change anything (w/o modifying notifico and then running it on my own server)
[2015/11/12 11:01:03] <mt> I can disable it, but...
[2015/11/12 11:01:18] <Tobbi> mt: hmm...okay, so there's really nothing we can do, for now...
[2015/11/12 11:01:45] <Tobbi> We could ask github to give us fine-grained control.
[2015/11/12 11:01:50] <Tobbi> but that's asking too much, I assume.
[2015/11/12 11:02:19] <mt> Yeah
[2015/11/12 11:03:00] <mt> what wouldn't be asking too much of github would be include all label changes in, say the last minute, in one event
[2015/11/12 11:03:15] <mt> but that would - in the end - also require updating notifico's code

[2015/11/12 11:42:35] <head8debian> Its expensive...
[2015/11/12 11:42:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: Wow, you're growing up to be an ordinary person.
[2015/11/12 11:42:37] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/12 11:43:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, whats that mean?
[2015/11/12 11:43:13] <Tobbi> head8debian: What it means.
[2015/11/12 11:43:17] <brmbrmcar> I hate paying for music.
[2015/11/12 11:44:01] <head8debian> I figured i'd better support support the bands i listen to. Keeps them in buisiness. :)
[2015/11/12 11:45:27] <brmbrmcar> I never buy music.
[2015/11/12 11:45:47] <brmbrmcar> Why would I :P
[2015/11/12 11:46:56] <mt> In Germany, torrenting music is like paying 500 â¬ for a CD
[2015/11/12 11:47:11] <head8debian> mt: Why?
[2015/11/12 11:47:14] <mt> heck, even more
[2015/11/12 11:47:19] <head8debian> Bandwidth that expensive? :p
[2015/11/12 11:47:33] <head8debian> I don't torrent it. Or use any odd websites...
[2015/11/12 11:47:38] <mt> because you'll get an Abmahnung (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abmahnung)
[2015/11/12 11:48:07] <head8debian> Ouch.
[2015/11/12 11:48:16] <brmbrmcar> If I want music, I download a high quality version from Youtube.
[2015/11/12 11:48:26] <brmbrmcar> Completely illegal, but who cares.
[2015/11/12 11:48:37] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Same here... ;)

[2015/11/12 11:48:55] <mt> Sadly, high quality music from youtube or even bought from itunes/google play/amazon isn't really high quality
[2015/11/12 11:48:55] <head8debian> Our church half hinges on youtube...
[2015/11/12 11:49:12] <head8debian> mt: I know what you mean.

[2015/11/12 11:49:44] <head8debian> percent of the profit*
[2015/11/12 11:49:52] <mt> dunno
[2015/11/12 11:49:56] <leyyin> I buy music from my local dealer :D
[2015/11/12 11:49:57] <leyyin> it's free
[2015/11/12 11:50:15] <head8debian> I usually listen to the radio...
[2015/11/12 11:50:24] <leyyin> head8debian, you drive a lot?
[2015/11/12 11:50:25] <brmbrmcar> But these days, quality of CDs is actually getting worse, as most people write to MP3 when making it.
[2015/11/12 11:51:03] <mt> I still know of studios using magnet tape for recording and mastering
[2015/11/12 11:51:09] <head8debian> leyyin: A decent amount. Not much though.
[2015/11/12 11:51:31] <leyyin> radio listening is only when driving :P
[2015/11/12 11:51:41] <head8debian> mt: Alof of studios i know keep it digital as much as possible.
[2015/11/12 11:51:57] <head8debian> Record high quality as digital.
[2015/11/12 11:52:00] <leyyin> if it's lossless, then it's fine
[2015/11/12 11:52:51] <head8debian> As long as it doesn't sound awfull im fine with it. :p
[2015/11/12 11:53:09] <brmbrmcar> Why do people listen to the radio when driving?
[2015/11/12 11:53:29] <brmbrmcar> I listen to all the bumps and creaks!
[2015/11/12 11:53:34] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/11/12 11:53:56] <brmbrmcar> Way better. :D

[2015/11/12 12:02:37] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Vehicle? Or motor?
[2015/11/12 12:02:44] <brmbrmcar> Vehichle.
[2015/11/12 12:02:44] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: A V10.
[2015/11/12 12:02:51] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Ford Excursion.
[2015/11/12 12:03:05] <brmbrmcar> How old?
[2015/11/12 12:03:12] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: 13 years.
[2015/11/12 12:03:17] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: quack it. :p
[2015/11/12 12:03:59] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: The other vehicle is a 2001 Dodge Ram. 24 valve. 6 cylinder Diesel.
[2015/11/12 12:04:21] <head8debian> Actually, its an 8 cylinder.
[2015/11/12 12:04:25] <head8debian> Cummins. :D
[2015/11/12 12:04:59] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/12 12:05:02] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: quack it = look it up on duckduckgo...
[2015/11/12 12:05:08] <brmbrmcar> Both bad for cras tests.
[2015/11/12 12:05:22] <brmbrmcar> That's what I wanted to know.
[2015/11/12 12:05:22] <head8debian> nope, its a 6 valve.
[2015/11/12 12:05:28] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: FOr what?
[2015/11/12 12:05:36] <brmbrmcar> Crashing.
[2015/11/12 12:05:39] <brmbrmcar> Safety.
[2015/11/12 12:05:50] <head8debian> We don't have emissions test and other junk up here... thankfully.
[2015/11/12 12:06:10] <brmbrmcar> Where are you?
[2015/11/12 12:06:13] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Uhm, these vehicles are much safer in a crash than any car.
[2015/11/12 12:06:22] <head8debian> Northern USA?
[2015/11/12 12:06:36] <brmbrmcar> Not into something like a tree.
[2015/11/12 12:06:56] <mt> sadly you don't have emissions tests
[2015/11/12 12:07:01] <brmbrmcar> And also Safe small is better than Dangerous big.
[2015/11/12 12:07:40] <head8debian> brmbrmcar:I dissagree. Do you want to meet a semi with a car or with a truck? Do you want to meet a truck with a car or another truck?
[2015/11/12 12:07:52] <head8debian> Without all the emissions crud Diesels could get 20mpg.
[2015/11/12 12:08:02] <head8debian> Currently they get about 11mpg.
[2015/11/12 12:08:04] <head8debian> mt: o_O
[2015/11/12 12:08:08] <brmbrmcar> Watch the
[2015/11/12 12:08:54] <head8debian> mt: If you show me some sort of emissions stuff that actually works on a diesel engine, then maybei  will change my mind.
[2015/11/12 12:09:01] <head8debian> I understand the CAT converter on a car.

[2015/11/12 12:10:12] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: And up here where we get so much snow you don't want to have a car. You will get stuck before you can blink on half these roads.
[2015/11/12 12:10:51] <head8debian> Also, explain to my why its considered better for the enviroment to have the engine burn twice as much fuel for the same result vs half the fuel for the same result.
[2015/11/12 12:11:40] <brmbrmcar> Anything can go through snow if you are brave.
[2015/11/12 12:12:01] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: LOL. ;)

[2015/11/12 12:14:23] <head8debian> I hate all the electronics in these new cars. Sure they are great while they work, but they are so expensive when they break.
[2015/11/12 12:15:09] <head8debian> Every farmer and person ive talked to that know how this stuff actually works have nothing good to say about it.
[2015/11/12 12:15:18] <head8debian> And neither do i...
[2015/11/12 12:15:45] <brmbrmcar> I want one with an electromagnet to repel other vehichles when they are too close.

[2015/11/12 12:17:04] <brmbrmcar> Easy.
[2015/11/12 12:17:16] <brmbrmcar> More tourque.
[2015/11/12 12:17:30] <head8debian> Which is why you have a truck. :)
[2015/11/12 12:18:36] <brmbrmcar> Trucks never have as much torque as sport vehichles.

[2015/11/12 12:25:45] <brmbrmcar> Are they pets?
[2015/11/12 12:25:56] <head8debian> Tobbi should buy a goat to trim his lawn and eat his trash...
[2015/11/12 12:26:04] <head8debian> They like old fruit better though.

[2015/11/12 12:31:33] <brmbrmcar> Do the goats have restraints?
[2015/11/12 12:31:49] <head8debian> Wheat has never been genetically modified. :D
[2015/11/12 12:32:04] <head8debian> Im no GMO nut. We do what we have to to feed everyone.
[2015/11/12 12:32:12] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Pastures? Yes.
[2015/11/12 12:32:21] <brmbrmcar> Not that.
[2015/11/12 12:32:41] <brmbrmcar> Like safety belts for the back of the truck.
[2015/11/12 12:33:06] <brmbrmcar> THe big one.
[2015/11/12 12:33:45] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Uhm, we don't move them unless we need to. When they need to be moved they get a trailer that is open inside and they lay down while we are moving.
[2015/11/12 12:34:03] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/12 12:34:47] <head8debian> Animals have very quiet and comfortable and lazy lives. :)
[2015/11/12 12:34:57] <Tobbi> Depends on the animal.
[2015/11/12 12:35:02] <head8debian> True.
[2015/11/12 12:35:07] <head8debian> Most domestic ones do.
[2015/11/12 12:35:14] <head8debian> Dairy animals mostly..
[2015/11/12 12:35:31] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do you know Kobe beef? Best beef there is.
[2015/11/12 12:35:38] <head8debian> Eat, sleep, poop, get milked, thats their life. :D

[2015/11/12 12:38:17] <brmbrmcar> I hate meat.
[2015/11/12 12:38:20] <Tobbi> about that subject.
[2015/11/12 12:38:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes, america fast paced...sadly.
[2015/11/12 12:38:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: What a coincidence. :p
[2015/11/12 12:38:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why coincidence?
[2015/11/12 12:39:04] <head8debian> You know nothing, yet he knows everything, yet you can call it by a name. ;)
[2015/11/12 12:39:09] <head8debian> nm...
[2015/11/12 12:39:27] <head8debian> Our family is much slower paced IMHO.
[2015/11/12 12:39:52] <brmbrmcar> Accelerator! Accelerator!
[2015/11/12 12:39:58] <head8debian> Its nice. :)
[2015/11/12 12:40:31] @ Quit: xet7: Quit: Leaving
[2015/11/12 12:42:23] <brmbrmcar> What is?
[2015/11/12 12:46:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzCf2RJHNSw
[2015/11/12 12:48:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: Is your police really that...strict?
[2015/11/12 12:52:21] <brmbrmcar> POLICE!!!
[2015/11/12 12:54:23] <brmbrmcar> Oh my god.
[2015/11/12 12:54:29] <brmbrmcar> That is bad.
[2015/11/12 12:55:27] @ alket joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/12 12:57:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, what did the motercyclist do in the last part?
[2015/11/12 12:58:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: I really don't know.
[2015/11/12 12:58:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Usually its about like the first half, maybe slightly more strict. We don't allow drag racing, and it is dangerous, especially on our roads.
[2015/11/12 12:58:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, I have to admit that I think it might be an unfair comparison.
[2015/11/12 12:58:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: He had to have done something pretty bad to have been treated like that.
[2015/11/12 12:58:46] <Tobbi> Probablz.
[2015/11/12 12:58:51] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2015/11/12 12:59:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, I got stopped by the police once. For going too fast. I was in quite a hurry...
[2015/11/12 12:59:21] <head8debian> Yes. We have accedentally once also.
[2015/11/12 12:59:26] <head8debian> And a couple flat tires.
[2015/11/12 12:59:48] <Tobbi> I needed to get dressed properly...and we had a choral concert... So, of course I was going 60 in a 30 speed limit zone.
[2015/11/12 12:59:50] <head8debian> Police are not mean over here, but im sure they can seem ruder than they are.
[2015/11/12 13:00:00] <head8debian> Yeah... ouch.
[2015/11/12 13:00:09] <Tobbi> So, I explained to the officer that I was in quite a hurry, and fortunately he didn't give me a ticket.
[2015/11/12 13:00:25] <head8debian> Ok, thats a easy let off. We get a warning. ;)
[2015/11/12 13:00:31] <head8debian> Then a ticket.
[2015/11/12 13:00:40] <brmbrmcar> I am scared of the US!
[2015/11/12 13:00:50] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Me too! :D
[2015/11/12 13:00:51] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/12 13:01:27] <brmbrmcar> All the death penalties!
[2015/11/12 13:01:34] <head8debian> But our police are not bad. If everyone else is going 75 and your going 77 you wont get pulled over...
[2015/11/12 13:01:37] <Tobbi> Oh, yeah, that...
[2015/11/12 13:01:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: In kph, please.
[2015/11/12 13:01:48] <brmbrmcar> I am glad I don't live there.
[2015/11/12 13:01:55] <brmbrmcar> No offence.
[2015/11/12 13:02:11] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Oh brother. There have not been many death offences in the US. Too few IMHO.
[2015/11/12 13:02:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm...
[2015/11/12 13:02:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't know KMph...
[2015/11/12 13:02:30] <Tobbi> okay...
[2015/11/12 13:02:51] <brmbrmcar> I do.
[2015/11/12 13:03:04] <head8debian> We feed some of these criminals their whole life through our taxes and they sit in jail and watch TV all day...
[2015/11/12 13:03:13] <Tobbi> haha
[2015/11/12 13:03:13] <brmbrmcar> 123 km/h
[2015/11/12 13:03:15] <Tobbi> "One of the shortest words in the German dictionary is RindfleischetikettierungsÃ¼berwachungsaufgabenÃ¼bertragungsgesetz, for example, which loosely means âNoâ."
[2015/11/12 13:03:18] <head8debian> Our jails are quite crowded atm.
[2015/11/12 13:03:29] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, are you for or against the death penalty?
[2015/11/12 13:03:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: Can you explain it better to me?
[2015/11/12 13:04:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: Explain what?
[2015/11/12 13:04:17] <head8debian> The death penalty. ;)
[2015/11/12 13:04:26] <head8debian> I don't hear much about it.
[2015/11/12 13:04:33] <head8debian> nm.
[2015/11/12 13:05:02] <head8debian> This is getting awkward...
[2015/11/12 13:05:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: Uhm, you're the one living in the US?
[2015/11/12 13:05:18] * head8debian also wonders why he has headphones on and is not listening to anything.
[2015/11/12 13:05:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do they have the death penalty in Michigan?
[2015/11/12 13:06:02] <leyyin> also Europe is the main cause a lot of states are abolishing the death penalty
[2015/11/12 13:06:19] <leyyin> because only Europe produces the drugs and we refuse to sell them anymore
[2015/11/12 13:06:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im not sure if death is the correct way to go, but i don't like it that we have so many people sitting in jail.
[2015/11/12 13:06:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: IIRC we don't.
[2015/11/12 13:06:29] <Tobbi> leyyin: Which is good!
[2015/11/12 13:06:33] <leyyin> Tobbi, agree
[2015/11/12 13:06:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: however, Texas apparently still gets their drugs from somewhere else...
[2015/11/12 13:06:55] <leyyin> Tobbi, ilegally
[2015/11/12 13:07:01] <Tobbi> Probably, yeah.
[2015/11/12 13:07:10] <leyyin> only Europe sells those drugs legally
[2015/11/12 13:07:14] <leyyin> "sold" :D
[2015/11/12 13:07:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: I believe Hospira even stopped producing Pentobarbital...
[2015/11/12 13:07:19] <head8debian> Of course illegally! They will get them weather you allow it or not. Its human nature.
[2015/11/12 13:07:24] <Tobbi> Or what it's called.
[2015/11/12 13:07:36] <head8debian> Sadly...
[2015/11/12 13:07:47] <leyyin> also, texas ;)
[2015/11/12 13:07:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's a government ffs. They have to abide by the law...
[2015/11/12 13:07:49] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/12 13:07:52] <leyyin> the hill billy country
[2015/11/12 13:07:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: I wouldn't want to live there.
[2015/11/12 13:08:23] <leyyin> me neither, you should avoid southern states in murica anyway
[2015/11/12 13:08:36] <leyyin> Florida especially :D
[2015/11/12 13:08:39] <Tobbi> leyyin: Still, I regularly search the news about death penalty. Morbid curiosity...
[2015/11/12 13:08:40] <head8debian> The Bible also says "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth", so i have always belived that that mean 'a life for a life'. But i do belive self defence is one exception.
[2015/11/12 13:08:59] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh, c'mon, please. That principle is what Texas goes by...
[2015/11/12 13:09:00] <leyyin> head8debian, are you jew?
[2015/11/12 13:09:13] <leyyin> only jews apply that law
[2015/11/12 13:09:16] <leyyin> christians do not
[2015/11/12 13:09:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: Society evolves.
[2015/11/12 13:09:21] <head8debian> They are trying to allow marajuanna(or how ever its written) up here.
[2015/11/12 13:09:25] <leyyin> because Jesus told us to love
[2015/11/12 13:09:34] <Tobbi> Marihuana...
[2015/11/12 13:09:43] <head8debian> leyyin: *real* christians do, "christians" don't.
[2015/11/12 13:09:49] <leyyin> "An Eye for an Eye Will Make the Whole World Blind"
[2015/11/12 13:09:55] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/12 13:10:19] <Tobbi> We're at that topic again (religion)
[2015/11/12 13:10:28] <leyyin> Tobbi, yes, you heathen ;)
[2015/11/12 13:10:34] <head8debian> I don't know why anyone considers themselves a Christian when they don't even trust the Bible.
[2015/11/12 13:10:40] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/12 13:10:46] <leyyin> head8debian, are you mad that Starbucks changed their cup?
[2015/11/12 13:10:48] <Tobbi> leyyin: I am not a heathen. I am baptized and confirmed.
[2015/11/12 13:11:17] <head8debian> leyyin: They did? I dont keep track of stuff like that.
[2015/11/12 13:11:24] <leyyin> Tobbi, obvious trying to get under your skin joke, captain obvious ;)
[2015/11/12 13:11:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Catholic? Baby baptised?

[2015/11/12 13:11:46] <head8debian> NO YOUTUBE VIDEOS!
[2015/11/12 13:11:47] <Tobbi> Who cares about religion anyway.
[2015/11/12 13:11:52] <leyyin> head8debian, why not?
[2015/11/12 13:12:06] <leyyin> I worked at youtube for 3 months ;)
[2015/11/12 13:12:17] @ head8debian left channel #supertux ("ttyl...")
[2015/11/12 13:12:29] <leyyin> he left because of me
[2015/11/12 13:12:31] <Tobbi> what?
[2015/11/12 13:12:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: I thought it was because of me.
[2015/11/12 13:12:36] <leyyin> ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED
[2015/11/12 13:12:46] <leyyin> Tobbi, do you want to fight over it?
[2015/11/12 13:12:50] * leyyin punches Tobbi 
[2015/11/12 13:12:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, got better stuff to do.
[2015/11/12 13:13:03] <Tobbi> I don't need violence to fight you, leyyin.
[2015/11/12 13:13:16] <Tobbi> Violence is bad anyway.
[2015/11/12 13:13:17] <Tobbi> I got my chainsaw always with me.
[2015/11/12 13:13:25] * leyyin runs
[2015/11/12 13:13:27] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:14:10] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, the problem with religion is that it's supposed to be a moral guidance, somewhat, but it often claims to be so much more.
[2015/11/12 13:14:28] <red_bot> /me chases tobbi with his chainsaw...
[2015/11/12 13:14:30] <Tobbi> And people who are really religious don't get that it's all open to interpretation and can be seen more or less strict.
[2015/11/12 13:14:35] <Tobbi> red_bot: Stop!
[2015/11/12 13:14:55] <red_bot> Tobbi: What? :p
[2015/11/12 13:15:16] <Tobbi> red_bot: If you want to be like brm brm car and pretend to ragequit only to read the logs...

[2015/11/12 13:17:21] <head8debian> I wanted to. :D
[2015/11/12 13:17:33] <leyyin> and why no youtube videos?

[2015/11/12 13:21:05] <head8debian> And take it as a compliment...

[2015/11/12 13:37:00] <brmbrmcar> Which is why diarrhoea has to be spelt diarrhea.
[2015/11/12 13:37:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Do you like English?
[2015/11/12 13:37:18] <brmbrmcar> Which I hate.
[2015/11/12 13:37:30] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have grown to like it. It's really elegant.
[2015/11/12 13:37:35] <Tobbi> In a way.
[2015/11/12 13:37:37] <Karkus> Elegant?
[2015/11/12 13:37:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: The language flow is different...
[2015/11/12 13:37:51] <Karkus> It breaks all the rules all the time!?
[2015/11/12 13:38:00] <Tobbi> Karkus: But it sounds so...flowy...
[2015/11/12 13:38:01] <Karkus> German follows rules
[2015/11/12 13:38:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: In Britain everyone thinks german people sound angry
[2015/11/12 13:38:41] <brmbrmcar> I hate when they teach spelling rules for English that aren't ever right.
[2015/11/12 13:38:56] <Tobbi> Karkus: We don't only sound angry, we are angry. When we're not angry, we're not in any way conscious.
[2015/11/12 13:39:00] <brmbrmcar> I don't think German people sound amgry.
[2015/11/12 13:39:08] <Karkus> "'I' before 'E' except after 'C'"
[2015/11/12 13:39:10] <brmbrmcar> s/amgry/angry/
[2015/11/12 13:39:10] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "I don't think German people sound angry."
[2015/11/12 13:39:34] <brmbrmcar> I before E except after blank is better.
[2015/11/12 13:39:51] * head8debian rolls his eyes...

[2015/11/12 13:40:54] <brmbrmcar> Schoolis horrible.IRC school is not.
[2015/11/12 13:42:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: "I before E except after C? Is that an official rule? What about "riechen" then?
[2015/11/12 13:42:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's an english rule
[2015/11/12 13:42:25] <Tobbi> ah!
[2015/11/12 13:42:25] <Karkus> Reich?
[2015/11/12 13:42:35] <Tobbi> No, not rich.... riechen = to smell.
[2015/11/12 13:42:39] <head8debian> Yes, its a actual english rule. Helps with writing.
[2015/11/12 13:42:51] <Karkus> Weight? Height?

[2015/11/12 13:43:22] <Karkus> Food Poisoning = Lebensmittelvergiftung
[2015/11/12 13:43:25] <head8debian> How can you remember how to spell that?
[2015/11/12 13:43:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: Very good!
[2015/11/12 13:43:33] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:43:39] <Karkus> Transport links = Vehrkersverbindungen
[2015/11/12 13:43:45] <Karkus> If I spelled that right?
[2015/11/12 13:43:50] <Tobbi> Karkus: the "h" is at the wrong place.
[2015/11/12 13:43:53] <Karkus> Verkehr?
[2015/11/12 13:43:57] <Tobbi> Yes!
[2015/11/12 13:44:16] <Karkus> I haven't used either of those, ever
[2015/11/12 13:44:27] <Karkus> Hmmm, 'use'
[2015/11/12 13:44:29] <Tobbi> What a shame.
[2015/11/12 13:44:31] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:44:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I play Scrabble with my English lecturer at college every 2 weeks.
[2015/11/12 13:44:51] <brmbrmcar> brmbrmauto
[2015/11/12 13:44:52] <Tobbi> It's nice.
[2015/11/12 13:44:59] <Karkus> head8debian: If you can say it, you can spell it.
[2015/11/12 13:45:00] <head8debian> o-O
[2015/11/12 13:45:17] <head8debian> I haven no clue where to even begin pronouncing it.
[2015/11/12 13:45:36] <Karkus> Fer ker sfer bind ung en?
[2015/11/12 13:45:39] <brmbrmcar> Fer ker
[2015/11/12 13:45:43] <head8debian> I have enough issues pronouncing that oddball car dealer down the road's name.
[2015/11/12 13:45:48] <brmbrmcar> Karkus!

[2015/11/12 13:47:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: Wait, I showed you this before, right?
[2015/11/12 13:48:00] <head8debian> Karkus: Not sean it? ;p
[2015/11/12 13:48:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yepp
[2015/11/12 13:48:18] <head8debian> I still don't understand why sean is pronounced Shawn.
[2015/11/12 13:48:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, now something you might not have seen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaJtjJNrWf0

[2015/11/12 13:48:54] <head8debian> Karkus: How is that pronounced?
[2015/11/12 13:49:03] <Tobbi> Karkus: And it wasn't me who showed you that, right?
[2015/11/12 13:49:03] <Karkus> Sheh vawn
[2015/11/12 13:49:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Not this time, no

[2015/11/12 13:50:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't mind. Once I was told a story by a friend about something they did with their friend. Who happened to be me. -.-
[2015/11/12 13:50:09] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/12 13:51:11] <maths22> I'm working now on setting up OpenBuildService for the linux builds

[2015/11/12 13:53:04] @ claymore2 joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/12 13:53:48] <brmbrmcar> English is hard!
[2015/11/12 13:54:44] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So it's not your native language?
[2015/11/12 13:56:24] <brmbrmcar> It is.
[2015/11/12 13:57:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is Backpfeifengesicht a word?

[2015/11/12 13:58:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: You should rather not use it.
[2015/11/12 13:58:34] <Karkus> subtle is another stupid English spelling
[2015/11/12 13:58:35] <brmbrmcar> Longest word.

[2015/11/12 13:59:11] <brmbrmcar> But I would if talking about it.
[2015/11/12 13:59:37] <brmbrmcar> I know nothing about Titin.
[2015/11/12 14:00:06] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: its a protein, thats all i know.
[2015/11/12 14:00:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: What are the German views on the Second World War? Is it rude to talk about or make fun of it?
[2015/11/12 14:00:46] <Karkus> Specifically Germany
[2015/11/12 14:00:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's a really good question...I believe it's kind of a taboo subject here, still...
[2015/11/12 14:01:19] <Tobbi> We don't make fun of it.
[2015/11/12 14:01:34] <head8debian> We don't either.
[2015/11/12 14:01:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: I don't mean in a disrespectful way.
[2015/11/12 14:01:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: Problem is: Because of the refugee crisis, the right-wing parties get more attration.
[2015/11/12 14:01:38] <head8debian> I don't think.
[2015/11/12 14:01:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's perfectly alright.
[2015/11/12 14:02:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, what about this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDeG4S-mJts

[2015/11/12 14:02:18] <Tobbi> Karkus: Okay, you got me. I find that funny.
[2015/11/12 14:02:21] <brmbrmcar> Only because of a few idiots who started a war.
[2015/11/12 14:02:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: Hitler parodies are something different.
[2015/11/12 14:02:44] <Karkus> Tobbi: You've seen it already then? :P
[2015/11/12 14:02:52] <Tobbi> Karkus:  yeah ! :D

[2015/11/12 14:13:23] <Karkus> It's super easy to learn, takes a couple months to become fluent in it. (I've heard)
[2015/11/12 14:13:32] <Karkus> Very similar to Latin

[2015/11/12 14:16:21] <Karkus> leyyin: I guess that not many people are hipsters then.

[2015/11/12 14:17:49] <Tobbi> leyyin: Nerds learn Klingon.
[2015/11/12 14:18:38] <brmbrmcar> brmbrmcar language is like Linux. You get distrobutions of all major languages.
[2015/11/12 14:20:42] <brmbrmcar> Who wants to learn?

[2015/11/12 17:25:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not really...
[2015/11/12 17:25:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: But it's a religious song?
[2015/11/12 17:25:40] <Tobbi> or not?
[2015/11/12 17:26:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's one of the few songs I really like.
[2015/11/12 17:27:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not really my style... but part of our christmas playlist this year. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeaHAQklVVc&list=PLzGCPH8UWJzInF-XeNlDUZGvFjr0SWobt&index=3
[2015/11/12 17:27:32] <head8debian> I don't agree with all the lyrics in all of those songs, but meh. :p

[2015/11/12 19:01:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about you take over... :P Make language add-ons work after I tried unsuccessfully.
[2015/11/12 19:03:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did we actually ever decide on a proper release date?
[2015/11/12 19:09:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im thinking the day before christmas...
[2015/11/12 19:09:15] <head8debian> If thats possible.
[2015/11/12 19:09:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: But then people won't have that much time to see the new x-mas stuff.
[2015/11/12 19:09:31] <Tobbi> Actually, let me have a look.
[2015/11/12 19:10:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: True...
[2015/11/12 19:10:49] <head8debian> Tobbi: How about the 20th?
[2015/11/12 19:10:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: That could work.
[2015/11/12 19:11:00] <Tobbi> But, let's see...
[2015/11/12 19:11:37] <head8debian> Im afk. :)
[2015/11/12 19:12:21] <Tobbi> head8debian: SuperTux 0.3.1 was released on the 20th.
[2015/11/12 19:12:25] <Tobbi> So, maybe we should do that.
[2015/11/12 19:13:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Does this computer even look worth $45? http://www.asus.com/Notebooks/Eee_PC_1001PX_Seashell/
[2015/11/12 19:13:30] <head8debian> Used. 2gb ram.
[2015/11/12 19:14:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: I have no idea.
[2015/11/12 19:15:25] <head8debian> Hmm... A local school is gettign rid of a bunch of them.
[2015/11/12 19:29:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: But Windows 10 is such a hog that i don't think they would fare well on them.
[2015/11/12 19:29:39] <Tobbi> heh
[2015/11/12 19:30:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Google chrome is a hog as of recently also...
[2015/11/12 19:31:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: I see.
[2015/11/12 19:33:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: You haven't noticed? :)
[2015/11/12 19:33:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't use google chrome as much.
[2015/11/12 19:34:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot open more than 10 tabs now in chrome without filling up my ram and causing swap to kick in.
[2015/11/12 19:36:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Am i boring you?
[2015/11/12 19:36:17] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do you want me to be honest?
[2015/11/12 19:38:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes!
[2015/11/12 19:38:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Actually, as much as you write, you could become a wikipedia editor.
[2015/11/12 19:39:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: I've considered it. :-) If i got paid i might consider it.
[2015/11/12 19:39:33] <head8debian> further*
[2015/11/12 19:39:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why would you want to get paid?
[2015/11/12 19:40:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Wikipedia is a voluntary site. No one earns anything.
[2015/11/12 19:40:07] <Tobbi> Except Jimmy Wales.
[2015/11/12 19:40:10] <head8debian> I know. :-) It was a joke.
[2015/11/12 19:40:33] <head8debian> But for as much as we both type we could have huge websites with tons of info...
[2015/11/12 19:40:43] <head8debian> And this is the best ive gotten... :p

[2015/11/12 19:46:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't think i will buy any of those computers...
[2015/11/12 19:46:27] <head8debian> I honestly don't feel right trying to resell anything with less than 4gb of ram.
[2015/11/12 19:46:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Good thinking. I would suggest a Rechenschiebevorrichtung.
[2015/11/12 19:47:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Huh?
[2015/11/12 19:47:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: calculation shifting appliance.
[2015/11/12 19:47:34] <head8debian> _O

[2015/11/12 19:48:58] <Tobbi> Stop that.
[2015/11/12 19:49:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: LOL. Sorry. :-) Or is he becoming like me? :)
[2015/11/12 19:49:50] <Tobbi> head8debian: Or you two are the same person?

[2015/11/12 19:51:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: Definately not.
[2015/11/12 19:51:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: good.
[2015/11/12 19:51:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: I should work on our wiki...
[2015/11/12 19:52:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, you should work on language add-on support.
[2015/11/12 19:52:19] <Tobbi> For some reason it won't work properly unless you restart...
[2015/11/12 19:52:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot code. We have been over this.
[2015/11/12 19:52:29] <head8debian> Uhm, at least it work?
[2015/11/12 19:52:31] <head8debian> works*
[2015/11/12 19:52:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yeah, it works...
[2015/11/12 19:52:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: You should really learn how to code.
[2015/11/12 19:54:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: I will learn a little when my Arduino gets here.
[2015/11/12 19:54:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, at least that's Python. Is it on its way?
[2015/11/12 19:54:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot even motivate myself to learn to program, how can i motivate myself to learn to code?
[2015/11/12 19:54:24] <Tobbi> Wait, is it python?
[2015/11/12 19:54:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Aren't those two things the same thing?
[2015/11/12 19:54:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: No. Its a hack up of C and C++
[2015/11/12 19:54:43] <Tobbi> Even better!
[2015/11/12 19:54:46] <head8debian> program a website**
[2015/11/12 19:55:02] <head8debian> Except my arduino was supposed to be here last week...
[2015/11/12 19:55:08] <head8debian> And still hasn't appeared.
[2015/11/12 19:55:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do you hate giving presentations as much as I do?
[2015/11/12 19:55:33] <head8debian> When i give one i will let you know. :-)
[2015/11/12 19:55:54] <Tobbi> heh...
[2015/11/12 19:56:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im getting more comfortable with speaking in front of people...
[2015/11/12 19:56:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: Well, actually it was worse when I was younger.
[2015/11/12 19:56:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: I speek in front of kids at church all the time, so how much harder can can grown ups be? :D
[2015/11/12 19:57:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: Kids are easier to integrate into a dishwasher than grownups. So there's that.
[2015/11/12 19:57:43] <head8debian> heh.
[2015/11/12 19:58:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: Have you ever tried to integrate kids into a dishwasher?
[2015/11/12 20:00:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: No.
[2015/11/12 20:00:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: Do you have some Cat5 that i can have?
[2015/11/12 20:00:43] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, I wouldn't be able to care about a cat.
[2015/11/12 20:00:44] <head8debian> I need a short piece.

[2015/11/13 06:42:50] <Tobbi> maths22, Also, the windows builds are missing SSLEAY32.dll and LIBEAY32.dll

[2015/11/13 08:39:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: Your IRC client did some smamming yesterday...
[2015/11/13 08:39:39] <head8debian> spamming*
[2015/11/13 08:39:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Really?
[2015/11/13 08:39:46] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/13 08:39:55] <leyyin> Tobbi, you should kick yourself
[2015/11/13 08:40:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't see it in the logs...
[2015/11/13 08:40:19] <head8debian> Tobbi: You left here thankfully.
[2015/11/13 08:40:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: try the #stk logs.
[2015/11/13 08:40:32] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/13 08:41:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: It was even more excessive in #secretchronicles... so i put a temporary ban on you in there.
[2015/11/13 08:41:07] <head8debian> Must have had internet issues.
[2015/11/13 08:41:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yeah, I should probably use a bouncer...
[2015/11/13 08:41:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: Why?
[2015/11/13 08:42:24] <Tobbi> I thought I had shutdown my computer.
[2015/11/13 08:42:47] <Tobbi> Well..
[2015/11/13 08:47:27] <Tobbi> head8debian: SuperTux 0.3.5a is now in homebrew-games
[2015/11/13 08:48:18] <leyyin> who uses mac anyways :P
[2015/11/13 08:48:34] <Tobbi> leyyin: Who uses Chromebooks, anyways? :P
[2015/11/13 08:48:42] <leyyin> not me ;)
[2015/11/13 08:48:57] <leyyin> I did not use one for almost 2 months
[2015/11/13 08:48:57] <Tobbi> leyyin: Maybe if I knew anything about computers, I would probably buy a different one.
[2015/11/13 08:53:57] <Tobbi> Okay, that is getting old, I have to admit.
[2015/11/13 08:55:09] * head8debian nods...
[2015/11/13 08:55:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: You don't need to buy a diferent one, you need to install Arch on your current one. :D
[2015/11/13 08:55:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: I'd rather not.
[2015/11/13 08:57:52] <leyyin> head8debian, everyone knows that arch is for peasants and gentoo is for gods ;)
[2015/11/13 08:58:42] <head8debian> Ok, debian? :D
[2015/11/13 08:58:53] <leyyin> debian is for plebs :P
[2015/11/13 08:59:04] <head8debian> Tobbi + ubuntu. Fits perfect. :p
[2015/11/13 08:59:11] <Tobbi> I tried ubuntu.
[2015/11/13 08:59:18] <head8debian> leyyin + gentoo, fits perfect.
[2015/11/13 08:59:18] <Tobbi> Didn't like it.
[2015/11/13 08:59:30] <head8debian> head8debian + gentoo. Pushing it too far.
[2015/11/13 08:59:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't blame you.
[2015/11/13 09:00:11] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its a broken OS IMHO.
[2015/11/13 09:09:32] <leyyin> os means bone in Romanian :P
[2015/11/13 09:09:41] <leyyin> get another os Tobbi
[2015/11/13 09:09:43] <leyyin> good boy
[2015/11/13 09:09:53] <Tobbi> leyyin: os is bone in Latin as well.
[2015/11/13 09:10:05] <leyyin> well yeah, we are latin people ;)

[2015/11/13 09:10:34] <leyyin> and fino-ugric people to the west :P
[2015/11/13 09:10:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: I don't know anything about languags :D
[2015/11/13 09:11:04] <Tobbi> *languages
[2015/11/13 09:11:17] <Tobbi> haha.
[2015/11/13 09:11:18] <Tobbi> Sorry.
[2015/11/13 09:11:54] <leyyin> well at least you know your language group, right?
[2015/11/13 09:12:41] <Tobbi> leyyin: Germanic? :P

[2015/11/13 09:14:35] <Tobbi> Despite me not knowing anything.
[2015/11/13 09:14:39] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/13 09:14:42] <Tobbi> maths22: Thanks.
[2015/11/13 09:14:47] <maths22> Also, I haven't yet integrated your recent changes into my branch, hence the wrong version number
[2015/11/13 09:15:02] <maths22> (It hasn't been rebuilt recently)
[2015/11/13 09:15:11] <Tobbi> Right!
[2015/11/13 09:15:14] <Tobbi> No problem.
[2015/11/13 09:15:46] <Tobbi> leyyin: I got a task for you: Find out why language packs only work properly after a restart...
[2015/11/13 09:16:02] <Tobbi> for SuperTux that is.
[2015/11/13 09:16:39] <leyyin> busy for STK :P
[2015/11/13 09:16:44] <leyyin> hiker is gonna kill me
[2015/11/13 09:16:56] <leyyin> Tobbi, what is your threat?
[2015/11/13 09:17:13] <Tobbi> leyyin: I can kill you as well? As you know, I got a chainsaw.
[2015/11/13 09:17:20] <Tobbi> Actually, make that two.
[2015/11/13 09:17:24] <leyyin> hiker has connections ;)
[2015/11/13 09:18:00] <Tobbi> damn.
[2015/11/13 09:35:43] <maths22> By the way, what Linux distros should we be building for?
[2015/11/13 09:35:50] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/13 09:39:45] <Tobbi> hmm. let me check.
[2015/11/13 09:43:21] <head8debian> Uhm, every OS we can? :D
[2015/11/13 09:43:35] <head8debian> distro*
[2015/11/13 09:44:40] <maths22> Setting up each one takes a non-zero amount of effort
[2015/11/13 09:45:18] <maths22> Therefore, I want to figure out which ones we want so I can focus that effort on the more important distros/versions first
[2015/11/13 09:46:31] <head8debian> maths22: Good idea.
[2015/11/13 09:49:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: What do you think?
[2015/11/13 09:49:47] <Tobbi> think?
[2015/11/13 09:49:52] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/11/13 09:50:09] <Tobbi> I mean: Target most popular distros and be good with it.
[2015/11/13 09:50:45] <maths22> You can see which ones are currently working here: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:maths22:SuperTux/supertux2
[2015/11/13 09:54:33] <Tobbi> maths22: So, target those that work. The other ones, well, if you can, compile the missing deps yourself on those distros and use that.

[2015/11/13 10:49:17] <head8debian> And dirty results, if you know what i mean.

[2015/11/13 10:58:04] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: I don't think my goats have wifi way over there, or can type so well.
[2015/11/13 10:59:56] <brmbrmcar> They use superfast Goat internet.
[2015/11/13 11:00:03] <brmbrmcar> Faster than 5g.
[2015/11/13 11:00:24] <brmbrmcar> And can type at over 400 WPM.
[2015/11/13 11:00:41] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/13 11:02:29] <mt> maths22: well I'd suggest to get the build working on opensuse 13.2 and ubuntu 15.10 (what's the problem with the latter - libsdl2-*dev exists in the official package archives for wily and even xenial)
[2015/11/13 11:03:10] <mt> possibly also centos 7, but I'm not sure anybody's using that on a desktop system
[2015/11/13 11:03:16] <brmbrmcar> Goat internet costs 9999000$ a month.
[2015/11/13 11:05:08] <head8debian> Nobody i know is using centOS as a desktop OS.
[2015/11/13 11:05:20] <mt> if you need an Arch Linux PKGBUILD I can provide you one
[2015/11/13 11:05:25] <brmbrmcar> What is centOS?
[2015/11/13 11:05:32] <head8debian> maths22: Not opensuse 43 or whatever the latest release is?
[2015/11/13 11:05:37] <head8debian> mt: ^^
[2015/11/13 11:05:51] <head8debian> I can also provide one.
[2015/11/13 11:07:04] <mt> brmbrmcar: it's CentOS and it's a binary-compatible rebuild of the RedHat Enterprise Linux sources without proprietary RedHat logos etc.
[2015/11/13 11:08:52] <mt> head8debian: openSUSE Tumbleweed is the latest release for the build service, I'm unsure what this OS 42/43/whatever is supposed to be

[2015/11/13 11:56:07] <mt> Also, I'd sugggest you to use such a dynamic versioning using git commit number since first commit and git commit hash for the other packages
[2015/11/13 11:56:25] <mt> Since OBS provides a usable repository for package manager
[2015/11/13 11:56:27] <mt> s
[2015/11/13 11:57:34] <maths22> mt: I will fix the version numbers
[2015/11/13 11:57:42] <maths22> They will end up like git describe ones
[2015/11/13 11:57:57] <maths22> (latest tag + hash)
[2015/11/13 12:00:24] <mt> Yeah but be careful with the PKGBUILD because that won't really work (0.4.0.ae4ab9b will be considered a lower version than 0.4.0.bb0e3e1 in pacman)
[2015/11/13 12:00:50] <mt> I don't know how other systems will handle that
[2015/11/13 12:01:38] <maths22> this is why it is actually latest tag + num commits + hash
[2015/11/13 12:01:55] <maths22> i.e 1.0.4-14-g2414721
[2015/11/13 12:02:00] <mt> why do you write tag + hash then
[2015/11/13 12:02:11] <maths22> Because I wasn't thinking
[2015/11/13 12:02:47] <mt> and if you're already saying 1.0.4-14-g24...: pacman doesn't allow dashes in pkgver
[2015/11/13 12:04:31] <brmbrmcar> Nome of the buil;ds work for me.

[2015/11/13 12:11:54] <mt> Tobbi: is that even allowed under GPL/CC-BY-SA? Aren't you only allowed to charge the cost of distribution (which I'd say for savannah is none)?

[2015/11/13 12:12:25] <Tobbi> That's a good question. I thought it was...

[2015/11/13 12:12:37] <Tobbi> SA...share alike.
[2015/11/13 12:12:50] <Tobbi> Question is GPL
[2015/11/13 12:13:03] <Tobbi> I don't know.
[2015/11/13 12:13:45] <mt> well as seen in the picture it uses our images
[2015/11/13 12:14:21] <mt> so, ask a lawyer and then submit a DMCA takedown notice?

[2015/11/13 12:16:38] <head8debian> sue, sue!
[2015/11/13 12:16:39] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/13 12:16:42] <maths22> Since these are art assets, and not code, the application of the GPL to them is less than obvious
[2015/11/13 12:16:48] <maths22> Thus, a good question for a lawyer

[2015/11/13 12:18:10] <Tobbi> mt: The image are share-alike. So if he shares only those (allows them to be downloaded)...
[2015/11/13 12:18:32] <Tobbi> right?
[2015/11/13 12:18:50] <Tobbi> I don't really want to pay for a lawyer :D not for this project.
[2015/11/13 12:19:15] <mt> I think EFF or some other open source organization provides lawyers for projects
[2015/11/13 12:19:26] <maths22> Due to the fact that images are not code, not linked in code, etc, sharing the assets probably is enough for him
[2015/11/13 12:20:49] <Tobbi> I hope he attributes us...
[2015/11/13 12:20:53] <Tobbi> He has to...
[2015/11/13 12:21:43] <mt> "Although ReTux re-uses the art assets of SuperTux, no code from SuperTux is used in ReTux."
[2015/11/13 12:22:04] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/13 12:22:21] <Tobbi> Okay, I rather meant in-game as well.
[2015/11/13 12:22:42] <maths22> I believe it owuld simply need to be in the game distribution
[2015/11/13 12:22:58] <maths22> That is, in some LICENCE/LEGAL/CREDITS file distributed with the game
[2015/11/13 12:23:12] <Tobbi> Unfortunately we cannot check.
[2015/11/13 12:23:23] <Tobbi> Since there are no binary distributions available,
[2015/11/13 12:24:20] <maths22> If there is no binary distribution, then it is hard to violate the terms associated with a binary distrubtion
[2015/11/13 12:24:23] <Tobbi> Are any of the items under a CC-NC license?
[2015/11/13 12:25:06] <maths22> (That is, he can't be doing something wrong with a thing that he is has not created/shared)
[2015/11/13 12:25:43] <maths22> everything appears to be GPL or CC-BY-SA
[2015/11/13 12:26:06] <mt> Well, the art *has* to be attributed in any case, be it in the code or in a binary distribution
[2015/11/13 12:26:24] <mt> even if it'd just be CC-BY

[2015/11/13 12:37:43] <Tobbi> Does this guy indulge in getting on other people's nerves?

[2015/11/13 12:41:22] <Tobbi> Not sure.
[2015/11/13 12:42:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: I can give you a bouncer if you would really like.
[2015/11/13 12:42:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: I'd rather go for a proper one...
[2015/11/13 12:42:29] <Tobbi> Or I host it on my raspberry pi.
[2015/11/13 12:42:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/13 12:42:44] <head8debian> It is propper.
[2015/11/13 12:43:34] <Karkus> Regarding that freegamedev post, what if he's using the code from supertux too?
[2015/11/13 12:43:40] <Karkus> How could we ever know?
[2015/11/13 12:43:55] <Tobbi> We can't.
[2015/11/13 12:44:23] <Tobbi> That's actually a problem.
[2015/11/13 12:44:38] <Karkus> With the GPL in general
[2015/11/13 12:44:50] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/13 12:44:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: http://retux.nongnu.org/index.html this uses SuperTux images
[2015/11/13 12:44:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: I wonder if brmbrmcar is spying on us through the logs... they will refresh in 3 mins...

[2015/11/13 12:45:01] <Karkus> Speak of the devil
[2015/11/13 12:45:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: He PMed me and asked me why I kicked him.
[2015/11/13 12:45:07] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/13 12:45:13] <Tobbi> He told me his message wasn't coming through.
[2015/11/13 12:45:29] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Don't Ping people repeadedly.
[2015/11/13 12:45:30] <Tobbi> Not sure if his client was acting up or whether he was just getting on our nerves.
[2015/11/13 12:45:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: I think latter... my client never acts up...
[2015/11/13 12:45:50] <Tobbi> I still assume it's the latter but we can never know.
[2015/11/13 12:45:52] <Tobbi> hah
[2015/11/13 12:46:02] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: If there appears to be a problem, try reconnecting rather than resending the message
[2015/11/13 12:46:06] <head8debian> Ive never have had one act up either.
[2015/11/13 12:46:17] <brmbrmcar> I didn't know I sent it.
[2015/11/13 12:46:32] <brmbrmcar> After a while I just restarted.
[2015/11/13 12:46:35] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: mt told you to stop, what else could he have been referring to?
[2015/11/13 12:46:45] <brmbrmcar> I didn't see it.
[2015/11/13 12:46:53] <Karkus> head8debian: My experience with bad internet tells me that sometimes I send a message and see it in the client but it hasn't sent.
[2015/11/13 12:47:00] <Karkus> This could be the other way rounf
[2015/11/13 12:47:24] <maths22> I'm guessing the client stopped showing new messages
[2015/11/13 12:47:34] <maths22> Including those he sent
[2015/11/13 12:47:37] <Karkus> maths22: I'm guessing that too
[2015/11/13 12:48:00] <head8debian> Karkus: irssi tells me if its having trouble connecting to the server.
[2015/11/13 12:48:17] <Karkus> head8debian: After how long?
[2015/11/13 12:48:40] <Karkus> Hexchat takes a while to notice
[2015/11/13 12:49:15] <head8debian> Karkus: Usually a few seconds. Then it tells you when the last time it was able to contact the server.
[2015/11/13 12:49:24] <maths22> It sounds like a bug, not a network error
[2015/11/13 12:49:34] <brmbrmcar> The [#supertux] disappeared.
[2015/11/13 12:49:41] <Karkus> It doesn't matter what caused it.
[2015/11/13 12:49:44] <maths22> Given that he had to restart to fix it
[2015/11/13 12:49:54] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: What IRC client do you use now?
[2015/11/13 12:50:37] <brmbrmcar> irssi
[2015/11/13 12:51:19] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/13 12:51:41] <Karkus> HexChat is better :P
[2015/11/13 12:51:56] <head8debian> Karkus: :-)
[2015/11/13 12:52:03] <head8debian> User glitch... :p
[2015/11/13 12:52:17] <Karkus> head8debian: ?
[2015/11/13 12:52:42] <maths22> Irssi is certainly better-you can leave it running on a server 24/7
[2015/11/13 12:53:02] <maths22> I can't do that with hexchat
[2015/11/13 12:53:08] <Karkus> maths22: Why would you?
[2015/11/13 12:53:11] <Karkus> It's a gui
[2015/11/13 12:53:11] <brmbrmcar> And anyway, when I say the word "test", surely you must mean something has happened?
[2015/11/13 12:53:36] <maths22> I wouldn't
[2015/11/13 12:53:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: Not sure if you can help it, but: Would you know/be able to find out how to make tinygettext effectively re-read the dictionaries (currently, language add-ons still don't work properly until you restart)
[2015/11/13 12:54:15] <maths22> My point was that irssi is clearly superior because it is cli- based /s
[2015/11/13 12:54:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'll have a look. Doubt I'll be of any help D:
[2015/11/13 12:54:38] <Tobbi> No problem.
[2015/11/13 12:55:14] <Karkus> maths22: Superior for some things, but sometimes you just want a pretty GUI
[2015/11/13 12:55:16] <head8debian> Karkus: Irssi is running on a headless server for me.
[2015/11/13 12:55:29] <head8debian> The last couple days the server hasn't had the best uptime. :p
[2015/11/13 12:55:30] <Karkus> head8debian: Which is a good way to use it
[2015/11/13 12:55:42] <mt> weechat <3
[2015/11/13 12:55:43] <head8debian> Yes, thats why im "always" in IRC.
[2015/11/13 12:55:51] <mt> also command line + support for IRCv3
[2015/11/13 12:55:53] <Karkus> head8debian: I figured
[2015/11/13 12:56:29] <Karkus> head8debian: I did try irssi but I didn't like it, just my opinion :) Not the kind of thing I needed
[2015/11/13 12:56:30] <brmbrmcar> irssijust looks awesome
[2015/11/13 12:56:55] <maths22> I actually have irssi set up as a proxy too, so I can use native irc clients (on my phone) in the same session
[2015/11/13 12:56:58] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: No, it looks like it's cli based
[2015/11/13 12:57:32] <head8debian> maths22: I don't really care. Irssi does the job well, and according to you is not "broken".
[2015/11/13 12:57:53] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: What?
[2015/11/13 12:57:56] <head8debian> maths22: I just ssh into my server.
[2015/11/13 12:58:03] <head8debian> From my phone. :)

[2015/11/13 12:58:16] <maths22> Some days I do
[2015/11/13 12:58:16] <Karkus> Command Line... Interface?
[2015/11/13 12:58:19] <head8debian> I don't like phone IRC though.
[2015/11/13 12:58:29] * head8debian laughs...
[2015/11/13 12:58:55] <maths22> I mostly got tired of losing spell check and swype
[2015/11/13 12:58:56] <head8debian> Now we are sharing screenshots? :p
[2015/11/13 12:59:06] <head8debian> maths22: Ah.
[2015/11/13 12:59:39] <head8debian> Irssi + guake = awesome. :D
[2015/11/13 12:59:52] <maths22> mt: which os?
[2015/11/13 12:59:56] <head8debian> I have my irc client at the cue of a couple hotkeys.
[2015/11/13 13:00:11] <brmbrmcar> How did you get it lokoing like that?
[2015/11/13 13:00:17] <head8debian> That reminds me, i should change my desktop background.
[2015/11/13 13:00:28] <head8debian> Look like he has a 4k screen or something...
[2015/11/13 13:00:31] <mt> Arch Linux, bspwm, GTK and QT with the Arc theme + breeze icons
[2015/11/13 13:00:50] <mt> Terminal is gnome-terminal but I'm also using xfce4-terminal
[2015/11/13 13:01:17] <mt> tmux for as terminal multiplexer, weechat for IRC
[2015/11/13 13:01:57] <mt> and no 4K, it's a full HD 27" display
[2015/11/13 13:02:11] <head8debian> Oh, 2k then. :)
[2015/11/13 13:02:25] <head8debian> Yeah... thats huge.
[2015/11/13 13:02:29] <brmbrmcar> 32K
[2015/11/13 13:02:42] <brmbrmcar> 4K is horrible!
[2015/11/13 13:03:05] <brmbrmcar> 4K is just giant blocks of colour!
[2015/11/13 13:03:14] <head8debian> maths22: Why bspwm?
[2015/11/13 13:03:27] <head8debian> maths22: Arg. Sorry.
[2015/11/13 13:03:33] <head8debian> mt: Why bspwm?
[2015/11/13 13:03:53] <mt> because it like its configuration; it supports gaps etc.
[2015/11/13 13:04:05] <head8debian> Ah.

[2015/11/13 14:37:34] <mt> why not?
[2015/11/13 14:38:30] <brmbrmcar> Because it would be chaos.
[2015/11/13 14:39:09] <brmbrmcar> It is a game-wide thing.
[2015/11/13 14:40:26] <datahead8888> Does Super Tux only use one collision box/circle to detect both enemy hits and if Tux is standing on the ground, or does it use a second collision detection and/or line casting?  If it only uses one collision, how does it tell if he collided on top of an object?
[2015/11/13 14:45:09] <datahead8888> I needed to clean up my collision detection in another game and was curious about this in Super Tux, since Math Nerd referenced it when I asked him.
[2015/11/13 14:49:58] <Karkus> datahead8888: I don't understand your question, what's wrong with one collision box?
[2015/11/13 14:54:05] <datahead8888> I never said anything was wrong with it :)
[2015/11/13 14:54:11] <datahead8888> I just asked how Super Tux does it.
[2015/11/13 14:54:59] <datahead8888> In my own game, I have one circle collider plus, essentially, four smaller circle colliders on top, bottom, left, and right.  It is a mess, I think.
[2015/11/13 14:55:02] <Karkus> datahead8888: Then I don't understand your question :P
[2015/11/13 14:55:35] <brmbrmcar> Collision!
[2015/11/13 14:55:55] <datahead8888> Does Super Tux detect both Super Tux running into enemies and standing on the ground using only one collision box?  Is more than one collision box used?  Does it also use line casting for part of this?
[2015/11/13 14:56:20] <brmbrmcar> I have no idea.
[2015/11/13 14:56:28] <brmbrmcar> I think just the one.
[2015/11/13 14:56:41] <datahead8888> Okay, I got that impression from what Math Nerd said
[2015/11/13 14:57:09] <datahead8888> I'd be curious to know how it tells if Tux is standing on top of a collided object or is to the side, though
[2015/11/13 14:57:37] <Karkus> datahead8888: All I know is, we use collision boxes, and we have problems sometimes
[2015/11/13 14:57:52] <datahead8888> Yes, especially with slopes I've heard
[2015/11/13 14:57:53] <Karkus> datahead8888: Boxes are different
[2015/11/13 14:58:04] <Karkus> datahead8888: Correct
[2015/11/13 14:58:24] <brmbrmcar> I don't know, maybe with decimals and gradient stuff to tell it which side of box.
[2015/11/13 14:58:42] <datahead8888> Gradients?
[2015/11/13 14:58:50] <brmbrmcar> Yeah
[2015/11/13 14:59:08] <datahead8888> Some people have suggested I add line casting to a collision box in my game; is this what you mean?
[2015/11/13 14:59:30] <brmbrmcar> Idon't know.
[2015/11/13 14:59:40] <brmbrmcar> What is your game?
[2015/11/13 15:01:09] <datahead8888> It is a Unity 2D platformer/shooter
[2015/11/13 15:01:21] <datahead8888> I was just curious how Super Tux handled things for reference
[2015/11/13 15:02:05] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/13 15:02:21] <brmbrmcar> Ino nothing about collision based stuff.
[2015/11/13 15:02:38] <leyyin> maths22, `sudo: required` is the opposite of `sudo: false` ?
[2015/11/13 15:03:57] <maths22> leyyin: nope
[2015/11/13 15:04:07] <maths22> The opposite is just not including `sudo: false`
[2015/11/13 15:04:27] <leyyin> the opposite as sudo:falses always run on containters
[2015/11/13 15:04:35] <leyyin> sudo:required never run on containers
[2015/11/13 15:04:53] <leyyin> so they seem to be ;)
[2015/11/13 15:05:07] <maths22> What is wrong wtih containers if you don't need sudo?
[2015/11/13 15:05:29] <leyyin> I do not know
[2015/11/13 15:05:53] <maths22> Were you just asking for your curiosity?
[2015/11/13 15:06:17] <brmbrmcar> Run this command but allow it to do anything it wants to this computer!
[2015/11/13 15:06:17] <leyyin> well yes
[2015/11/13 15:06:26] <leyyin> I am testing something out for the stk-editor
[2015/11/13 15:06:43] <brmbrmcar> The stk-editor doesn't work!
[2015/11/13 15:06:59] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, how so?
[2015/11/13 15:07:05] <leyyin> open issue
[2015/11/13 15:07:41] <brmbrmcar> I selected the directory with the files in and nothing happened!
[2015/11/13 15:08:03] <leyyin> did you read the manual :D
[2015/11/13 15:08:03] <leyyin> ?
[2015/11/13 15:08:16] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/13 15:08:28] <brmbrmcar> And the first step failed!
[2015/11/13 15:08:46] <brmbrmcar> Does it neeed to be 0.9.x?
[2015/11/13 15:08:54] <Karkus> datahead8888: A Unity game is a bit difficult to compare to SuperTux
[2015/11/13 15:09:01] <leyyin> I will have to check it out later
[2015/11/13 15:09:12] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/13 15:09:53] <datahead8888> Karkus, yes, but some principles do not change
[2015/11/13 15:10:56] <brmbrmcar> sudo apt-get install unity
[2015/11/13 15:11:55] <maths22> brmbrmcar: glad to know you appreciate the Ubuntu desktop interface
[2015/11/13 15:12:14] <maths22> (That is what that command would actually install on an Ubuntu machine)
[2015/11/13 15:12:54] <brmbrmcar> I don't like the tracking.
[2015/11/13 15:13:23] <brmbrmcar> And all the social media stuff.
[2015/11/13 15:13:44] <leyyin> maths22, also, is there no cleaner way to install mac packages? checking with an if "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" = "osx" is ugly :D
[2015/11/13 15:13:51] <leyyin> in before_install
[2015/11/13 15:14:13] <maths22> leyyin: at this point in time, no
[2015/11/13 15:14:26] <maths22> Hopefully, travis adds support like they have for apt as a plugin
[2015/11/13 15:14:31] <leyyin> yes :D
[2015/11/13 15:14:33] <leyyin> brew:
[2015/11/13 15:14:34] <leyyin> like apt
[2015/11/13 15:14:43] <maths22> That would be nice
[2015/11/13 15:14:57] <maths22> That said, SuperTux previously had it as a manual apt-get command
[2015/11/13 15:15:03] <maths22> because the apt plugin is pretty new
[2015/11/13 15:15:17] <brmbrmcar> sudo apt-get install supertux
[2015/11/13 15:15:27] <brmbrmcar> apt-cache search supertux
[2015/11/13 15:16:24] <Karkus> datahead8888: Yeah, of course. If you do line collision for each line in the rect, then you'll get the side. Or there are other fun ways.
[2015/11/13 15:17:02] <brmbrmcar> Crash!
[2015/11/13 15:19:13] <datahead8888> brmbrmcar, crash?
[2015/11/13 15:19:39] <brmbrmcar> datahead888: CRASH!
[2015/11/13 15:19:43] <leyyin> the containers suck :D, only 2 threads, really
[2015/11/13 15:19:51] <brmbrmcar> FRontal! Side! Rear!
[2015/11/13 15:19:54] <maths22> By the way, with these automated builds, I'm thinking that we need to change the way we label dev builds
[2015/11/13 15:19:56] <brmbrmcar> Rollover!
[2015/11/13 15:20:29] <maths22> Basically, tools tend to mark dev builds as coming x amount after the previous release, not coming before the next one
[2015/11/13 15:20:30] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: What are you on about?
[2015/11/13 15:20:54] <brmbrmcar> Crashes!
[2015/11/13 15:21:03] <brmbrmcar> brm brm car crashes!
[2015/11/13 15:21:27] <maths22> Therefore, we are currently on v0.3.5-385-gf69dc07 (by Git's numbering)
[2015/11/13 15:22:34] <maths22> This also makes package numbering work
[2015/11/13 15:22:59] <maths22> Currently, using our labeling scheme, we are on 0.4.0-git-3ecf...
[2015/11/13 15:23:17] <maths22> That either is not well ordered or comes after 0.4.0, which is actually the final release
[2015/11/13 15:23:50] <datahead8888> I think someone likes cars
[2015/11/13 15:24:32] <maths22> datahead8888: I'm with you on that one
[2015/11/13 15:24:43] <brmbrmcar> brm brm cars!
[2015/11/13 15:25:36] <leyyin> the trusty machines are even slower :D
[2015/11/13 15:25:43] <datahead8888> brmbrmcar, you ought to make a car crashing gmae
[2015/11/13 15:25:44] <datahead8888> ***game
[2015/11/13 15:25:52] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/13 15:25:58] <datahead8888> Seriously
[2015/11/13 15:26:00] <datahead8888> :)
[2015/11/13 15:26:02] <brmbrmcar> With airbags.
[2015/11/13 15:26:11] <brmbrmcar> I will try...
[2015/11/13 15:26:18] <maths22> leyyin: building supertuxkart?
[2015/11/13 15:26:18] <datahead8888> You could get points for better crashes and set up safety devices in the car
[2015/11/13 15:26:30] <leyyin> maths22, no, the stk-editor
[2015/11/13 15:26:33] <datahead8888> Be sure to use a good physics engine
[2015/11/13 15:26:54] <brmbrmcar> It would have to be realistic.
[2015/11/13 15:27:04] <datahead8888> Yeah
[2015/11/13 15:27:05] <maths22> leyyin: how long is it taking?
[2015/11/13 15:27:15] <datahead8888> You could also send cars into compressors in your game
[2015/11/13 15:27:34] <datahead8888> Or drop them from airplanes
[2015/11/13 15:27:35] <leyyin> about 2 minutes on 12.04
[2015/11/13 15:27:40] <leyyin> about 4 on 14.04
[2015/11/13 15:28:48] <brmbrmcar> Front end damage cm = speed in kmh divided by overlap
[2015/11/13 15:29:27] <maths22> leyyin: still less long than I had to wait when setting up the supertux builds
[2015/11/13 15:29:44] <brmbrmcar> After 40cm half damage amounts per 40cm
[2015/11/13 15:29:49] <leyyin> on the old machines with 32 threads, under 1 minute
[2015/11/13 15:29:49] <maths22> And I think I made about 50 commits (and waited through at least 30 of them)
[2015/11/13 15:29:59] <maths22> leyyin: what machines?
[2015/11/13 15:30:10] <leyyin> the old infrastructure of travis
[2015/11/13 15:30:34] <leyyin> well I will squash the commits to be only one ;)
[2015/11/13 15:30:36] <maths22> leyyin: infrastructure they don't have anymore, or the non-container one?
[2015/11/13 15:30:43] <maths22> leyyin: I will do the same
[2015/11/13 15:30:50] <leyyin> the non-container one
[2015/11/13 15:30:51] <maths22> If git doesn't hate me too much
[2015/11/13 15:31:06] <maths22> leyyin: That's odd.  Those are supposed to have 1.5 cores each (I believe)
[2015/11/13 15:31:13] <maths22> 32 threads should not have run that well
[2015/11/13 15:31:31] <leyyin> well it does not run well for STK but for the editor :D
[2015/11/13 15:31:40] <leyyin> for STK it crashes gcc
[2015/11/13 15:31:43] <leyyin> out of memory
[2015/11/13 15:31:54] <maths22> on the old one or the new one?
[2015/11/13 15:31:56] <leyyin> with make -j 32
[2015/11/13 15:31:59] <leyyin> the old one
[2015/11/13 15:32:49] <maths22> leyyin: did it do that with a lower number of parallel jobs, or did it actually build
[2015/11/13 15:33:05] <maths22> Also, seee the table here: http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/
[2015/11/13 15:33:17] <leyyin> nproc tells me there are 32
[2015/11/13 15:34:06] <leyyin> for the editor it did build
[2015/11/13 15:34:33] <maths22> See http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/speeding-up-the-build/#Parallelizing-your-build-on-one-VM
[2015/11/13 15:34:39] <maths22> That is where I got the 1.5 number
[2015/11/13 15:34:46] <maths22> Maybe that is only the new infrastructure
[2015/11/13 15:39:37] <brmbrmcar> Side impact is harder!
[2015/11/13 15:42:26] <brmbrmcar> Weight to size ratio percent will change figures, but speed in kmh divided by 4.

[2015/11/13 16:14:34] <brmbrmcar> I reset .supertux2 and everything was fine.
[2015/11/13 16:14:58] <brmbrmcar> But it was the same version that was buggy before.

[2015/11/13 16:31:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: We could actually have something in the config which creates spritesheets from the files, couldn't we?

[2015/11/13 18:04:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe we're uploading po files to Transifex.
[2015/11/13 18:04:27] <Tobbi> Unfortunately I don't know the details.
[2015/11/13 18:04:31] <Tobbi> Ask giby when he gets back.
[2015/11/13 18:04:38] <Tobbi> or rather when he magically appears.
[2015/11/13 18:04:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, but are they all just added manually
[2015/11/13 18:05:06] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe currently they are.

[2015/11/14 14:25:08] <brmbrmcar> I checked status.github.com

[2015/11/14 14:31:56] <mt> so if https://github.com works something is wrong in your config
[2015/11/14 14:32:31] <brmbrmcar> git clone https://github.com/brmbrmcar/supertux.git
[2015/11/14 14:32:50] <mt> yeah

[2015/11/14 14:34:58] <mt> which file?
[2015/11/14 14:36:16] <mt> if you mean that: the size of a git repository is so much bigger than the actual content/source code because it keeps all history
[2015/11/14 14:36:41] <mt> it also downloads all history unless you specify a --depth
[2015/11/14 14:38:19] <brmbrmcar> It said everything was up to date when I pushed the changes.
[2015/11/14 14:38:38] @ bb010g joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/14 14:39:47] <mt> well obviously if you didn't push the squashed commit it won't know about that anymore after you deleted your local copy
[2015/11/14 14:40:15] <mt> now squash the commit, git push -f, and wait for the PR to get merged
[2015/11/14 14:40:48] <brmbrmcar> Oh no.

[2015/11/14 14:43:59] <brmbrmcar> case, please try git rebase (--continue | --abort | --skip)
[2015/11/14 14:43:59] <brmbrmcar> If that is not the case, please rm -fr "/home/brmbrmcar/supertux/.git/rebase-merge"

[2015/11/14 14:44:04] <brmbrmcar> valuable there.
[2015/11/14 14:44:23] <mt> well, git rebase --abort
[2015/11/14 14:44:27] <mt> I'd suggest
[2015/11/14 14:44:49] <mt> then `git rebase -i HEAD~2`
[2015/11/14 14:44:50] <brmbrmcar> I did it.
[2015/11/14 14:45:02] <brmbrmcar> And the commits have gone again!
[2015/11/14 14:45:17] <mt> well, so you didn't rebase -i ... yet?
[2015/11/14 14:45:26] <mt> then git reset --hard ... again
[2015/11/14 14:45:34] <mt> then git rebase -i ...
[2015/11/14 14:46:05] <mt> and in the editor coming up, change the 'pick' in front of 'ce83bfc' to 'squash'
[2015/11/14 14:46:09] <mt> then save + close
[2015/11/14 14:46:42] <mt> in the new editor window, set a commit message for the squashed commit
[2015/11/14 14:46:46] <mt> save+close again
[2015/11/14 14:46:53] <mt> -> you're done

[2015/11/14 14:48:17] <brmbrmcar> I did all that, but it still says everything is up to date.
[2015/11/14 14:48:37] <mt> paste `git log --oneline | head -n 10`

There is quite a social division, which results in extremist views emerging as people do not feel like they are part of the community.

[2015/11/14 16:29:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: Wasn't it the IS who planned that?
[2015/11/14 16:29:29] <Tobbi> So, they still originated from within france?
[2015/11/14 16:29:32] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah
[2015/11/14 16:29:36] <Tobbi> hrm.
[2015/11/14 16:29:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: Probably
[2015/11/14 16:30:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe if something like that would've happened in Germany... we wouldn't be well prepared either.
[2015/11/14 16:31:02] <brmbrmcar> Scary!
[2015/11/14 16:31:39] <brmbrmcar> Bomb/bullet proof brm brm car
[2015/11/14 16:35:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: You know you got that email from that Google head hunter right? What happened then? I think Google is really cool :P
[2015/11/14 16:35:30] <Tobbi> Karkus: I told him that I'd be thrilled, and sent him my CV.
[2015/11/14 16:35:35] <Tobbi> He forwarded that to the European guys.
[2015/11/14 16:35:42] <Tobbi> He originally thought I was from the US.
[2015/11/14 16:35:51] <Tobbi> And apparently the European guys didn't have any openings for me.
[2015/11/14 16:36:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh, right D:
[2015/11/14 16:36:00] <Tobbi> I wonder whether my CV was wrong.
[2015/11/14 16:36:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I listed all programming languages I know even remotely...
[2015/11/14 16:36:17] <Tobbi> Maybe that was wrong.
[2015/11/14 16:36:31] <Tobbi> But I was so excited and wanted to give a good impression...
[2015/11/14 16:36:33] <Tobbi> So, yeah.
[2015/11/14 16:37:08] <Karkus> Tobbi: Probably just bad timing...
[2015/11/14 16:37:14] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2015/11/14 16:37:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, some people I talked to told me to try again. I might.
[2015/11/14 16:37:49] <brmbrmcar> What about brmbrmcar programming language? You just type things in and nothing happens.
[2015/11/14 16:37:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: You should. What do you have to lose by sending off an email?
[2015/11/14 16:37:58] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's true.
[2015/11/14 16:38:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: But it's weird that "Google applies with you for a job" :D
[2015/11/14 16:38:28] <Tobbi> Normally, it's the other way round.
[2015/11/14 16:39:11] <Karkus> Tobbi: They want the best of the best, so they search everywhere
[2015/11/14 16:39:18] <Tobbi> Probably.
[2015/11/14 16:39:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: But if they didn't take me that means I am not the best of the best.
[2015/11/14 16:39:35] <Karkus> Depending on where I head in the future, I might try to apply there
[2015/11/14 16:39:43] <Tobbi> So, maybe it doesn't make sense to apply again.
[2015/11/14 16:39:49] <brmbrmcar> Google is wierd.
[2015/11/14 16:40:07] <brmbrmcar> Google is not monopoly.
[2015/11/14 16:40:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: They might not have been looking for many applicants then
[2015/11/14 16:40:22] <Tobbi> Probably not.
[2015/11/14 16:40:29] <Tobbi> Still, I am not sure if I want to work at Google.
[2015/11/14 16:40:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: As you said, the guy who headhunted you thought you were American
[2015/11/14 16:40:52] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/11/14 16:41:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why ever not?
[2015/11/14 16:41:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, if you strip all the benefits off Google, at the end of the day, it's still a job.
[2015/11/14 16:41:38] <Tobbi> Karkus: The benefits are potentially tempting for me.
[2015/11/14 16:41:52] <brmbrmcar> I want to compete with Google.
[2015/11/14 16:41:54] <Tobbi> So, I might get more inclined to take a job at Google without looking for possibly better suiting alternatives.
[2015/11/14 16:42:00] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Compete with yourself, first.
[2015/11/14 16:42:08] <Tobbi> *better-suited
[2015/11/14 16:42:25] <brmbrmcar> I want to make software for driverless brm brm cars!
[2015/11/14 16:42:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Google is a nice environment, supposedly
[2015/11/14 16:43:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's made that way to make you productive.
[2015/11/14 16:43:21] <Tobbi> I assume.
[2015/11/14 16:43:40] <Karkus> Yeah
[2015/11/14 16:43:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, of course I am looking for prestige in my life and want everyone to think I am something special. And that's why it's so tempting to apply again.
[2015/11/14 16:44:08] <Tobbi> And that's why I want to think twice before doing so. I know my weaknesses. And prestige and money are two of them.
[2015/11/14 16:44:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: You don't have to work somewhere special to be special. You have to do something special
[2015/11/14 16:44:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: Money and prestige...
[2015/11/14 16:44:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know. But what I really want is come to terms with myself.
[2015/11/14 16:45:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: The thing I find enticing about Google is the 20% time.
[2015/11/14 16:45:33] <Tobbi> 20% to work on your own projects?
[2015/11/14 16:45:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Also, Google love people who work on open source projects
[2015/11/14 16:45:46] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/11/14 16:45:47] <Tobbi> right
[2015/11/14 16:45:57] <Karkus> Tobbi: As long as it has something to do with Google
[2015/11/14 16:46:01] <brmbrmcar> And no Google's rubbish that causes high speed crashes

[2015/11/15 07:55:59] <brmbrmcar> Any idea how to fight conflicting poackages without removing anythging?
[2015/11/15 07:56:13] <Karkus> conflicting packages???
[2015/11/15 07:56:33] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/15 07:56:42] <brmbrmcar> I can't build 0.0.6.
[2015/11/15 07:56:52] <Karkus> What's conflicting?
[2015/11/15 07:56:53] <brmbrmcar> So I am using a .deb file.
[2015/11/15 07:57:08] <brmbrmcar> Supertux 0.0.6 and supertux-stable
[2015/11/15 08:00:45] <Karkus> No, I have no idea :(
[2015/11/15 08:02:45] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/15 08:03:08] <brmbrmcar> I amtrying to create a Console command for MNID_RESETLEVEL.
[2015/11/15 08:03:22] <brmbrmcar> But I have no idea how to.
[2015/11/15 08:04:43] <Karkus> You want a console command which resets the level?
[2015/11/15 08:05:07] <Karkus> brmbrmcar:^
[2015/11/15 08:05:17] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/15 08:05:35] <brmbrmcar> I want a console command for a lot of things.
[2015/11/15 08:07:09] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Make an issue with all the commands you want
[2015/11/15 08:07:14] <brmbrmcar> K.
[2015/11/15 08:07:24] <brmbrmcar> But I will implement themall.
[2015/11/15 08:08:02] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: If you make an issue, we will be able to see what's going on, and help you :)
[2015/11/15 08:09:04] <brmbrmcar> Where?
[2015/11/15 08:09:08] <brmbrmcar> OnGithub?
[2015/11/15 08:10:46] <Karkus> Yes please

[2015/11/15 08:27:08] <Tobbi> Karkus: IPC with SuperTux might be difficult, though.
[2015/11/15 08:27:20] <Tobbi> IPC = Inter Process Communication.
[2015/11/15 08:27:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I didn't say it would be easy, or possible
[2015/11/15 08:27:31] <Karkus> Tobbi: ik
[2015/11/15 08:27:33] <Tobbi> It'd need a server that could run and get the commands.
[2015/11/15 08:27:42] <Tobbi> You know, run in the background.
[2015/11/15 08:27:54] <Tobbi> We could make that dependent on the developer switch.
[2015/11/15 08:28:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: So we would use sockets?

[2015/11/15 09:05:01] <Karkus> grumbel: My plans are to make it better than the current editor, and more portable
[2015/11/15 09:05:42] <Karkus> grumbel: https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/issues
[2015/11/15 09:07:45] <Karkus> grumbel: Tobbi had issues getting the current editor to work on Mac OSX, and we need an editor which will stay updated as the game does

[2015/11/15 09:21:55] <grumbel> Karkus: looks fine so far
[2015/11/15 09:23:11] <Tobbi> I really wonder whether the latest glbinding would work with SuperTux.
[2015/11/15 09:23:55] <Karkus> grumbel: I've also thought about a plugin API
[2015/11/15 09:26:28] <Karkus> grumbel: And IPC so the editor can affect what happens more than just by passing arguments
[2015/11/15 09:27:22] <grumbel> sounds like overkill
[2015/11/15 09:28:53] <Karkus> grumbel: Why? I want a tux object for the player to move and then he spawns there
[2015/11/15 09:29:07] <Karkus> I want a lot of things :P
[2015/11/15 09:29:15] <grumbel> ./supertux levelname.stl --start-pos x,y
[2015/11/15 09:30:08] <grumbel> I'd prefer something simple that actually works, then some pie-in-the-sky thing that never gets finished and makes portability harder
[2015/11/15 09:30:33] <Karkus> grumbel: Yeah, I see what you mean
[2015/11/15 09:31:18] <grumbel> I would focus on basic stuff, i.e. add auto-smoothing to the tile painting
[2015/11/15 09:31:29] <Karkus> auto smoothing?
[2015/11/15 09:31:54] <grumbel> automatically painting the edge tiles so you don't have to do that manually
[2015/11/15 09:32:08] <grumbel> the C# has a function for that, but it's not that great there either
[2015/11/15 09:32:12] <Karkus> Oh, yeah I thought about that too :)
[2015/11/15 09:32:19] <Tobbi> I wonder how we'd go about doing that... It needs to be simple.
[2015/11/15 09:32:33] <Karkus> What about slopes?
[2015/11/15 09:33:17] <grumbel> Has anybody played with the SuperMarioMaker thing on WiiU?
[2015/11/15 09:33:27] <Karkus> grumbel: Yup :)
[2015/11/15 09:33:47] <Karkus> grumbel: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/103
[2015/11/15 09:34:28] <Karkus> That kind of gameplay could exist like the old 0.1.x editor
[2015/11/15 09:34:54] <Tobbi> I still think that supertux's UI isn't the best choice for this kind of advanced editor.
[2015/11/15 09:37:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's why I want to continue with Flexlay
[2015/11/15 09:37:14] <Tobbi> Right.
[2015/11/15 09:37:28] <grumbel> Tobbi: it wouldn't need to be advanced, just something that lets people build levels easily
[2015/11/15 09:37:37] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/11/15 09:39:18] <Karkus> grumbel: Also, there are a few files (including everything in flexlay/wip, flexlay/[canvas, brush, brushmask].py etc.) which I don't understand the intended purpose of, and cannot find any information on what needs doing
[2015/11/15 09:39:21] <Tobbi> grumbel: By the way: After removing directories from tinygettext and rebuilding the cache, how would I go about refreshing the UI?
[2015/11/15 09:41:28] <grumbel> Karkus: Those are classes from the C++ code that haven't been ported over yet
[2015/11/15 09:41:45] <grumbel> Karkus: the Python editor is basically a 1:1 translation of the C++ code
[2015/11/15 09:44:38] <grumbel> Karkus: http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/flexlaypaint8.png
[2015/11/15 09:44:45] <Karkus> grumbel: Okay, I will look into that
[2015/11/15 09:44:52] <grumbel> flexlay used to have some drawing functionality
[2015/11/15 09:45:25] <grumbel> Canvas was the pixel buffer, brush and brushmask where the brushes you could draw into that pixel buffer
[2015/11/15 09:45:33] <Tobbi> I guess I will just display a message to please restart the game after installing language packs.
[2015/11/15 09:45:42] <grumbel> can be ignored for the moment, it's not really needed for supertux
[2015/11/15 09:46:50] <grumbel> something different: I cleaned up the lisp parser code and optimized it a bit: https://github.com/lispparser/sexp-cpp
[2015/11/15 09:47:21] <Tobbi> grumbel: Can you do a pull request against the SuperTux repo?
[2015/11/15 09:47:55] <Karkus> grumbel: Can I move the canvas files etc. into wip/ so they're out of the way?
[2015/11/15 09:48:06] <Karkus> Or onto a different branch?
[2015/11/15 09:48:54] <grumbel> Karkus: put them in wip/
[2015/11/15 09:49:31] <grumbel> Tobbi: will need some further work to integrate, I'll send a push request one day
[2015/11/15 09:49:39] <Tobbi> Thanks.
[2015/11/15 09:55:58] <grumbel> Tobbi: about refreshing the GUI with new translation, easiest would be to restart the main loop, i.e. the part in Main::launch_game()
[2015/11/15 09:56:12] <Tobbi> grumbel: But doing so from the UI?
[2015/11/15 09:56:40] <grumbel> Tobbi: maybe throw a TranslationUpdated exception or something like that?
[2015/11/15 09:56:53] <Tobbi> I could do that, actually.
[2015/11/15 09:56:55] <Tobbi> one moment.
[2015/11/15 10:00:32] <Tobbi> Actually, if I pop the screen, then push a new TitleScreen, this could work.
[2015/11/15 10:05:39] <Karkus> grumbel: Was the auto-smoothing a different tool?
[2015/11/15 10:06:25] <grumbel> Karkus: flexlay never really had auto-smoothing (other then some experimental script that never worked well)
[2015/11/15 10:06:40] <Karkus> grumbel: Well, what do you want then?
[2015/11/15 10:07:58] <grumbel> A tile tool that lets me select "snow" tiles and then paint them around while auto-smoothing the edges
[2015/11/15 10:08:58] <grumbel> The C# smoothing tool is a separate tool that you use to smooth out the tiles after you have painted them
[2015/11/15 10:09:27] <grumbel> It sort of works and could be ported over to Flexlay, but it's not quite as easy to use as I would like
[2015/11/15 10:09:54] <grumbel> The tricky part is that a lot of tilemaps in SuperTux aren't conceptually clean
[2015/11/15 10:10:00] <Tobbi> I was also thinking of a scenery creation tool that allows you to select different slopes and place them, and it'll automatically create a smooth scenery.
[2015/11/15 10:10:51] <grumbel> i.e. you might have tiles spread over different layers and such or special tiles that still look like other tiles
[2015/11/15 10:12:25] <grumbel> not sure how to deal with slopes, in flexlay/netpanzer-editor I had the ability to flatten/unflatten groups of tiles into objects
[2015/11/15 10:12:38] <grumbel> http://www.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/flexlay/images/netpanzer-1.jpg
[2015/11/15 10:12:39] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 272 seconds
[2015/11/15 10:12:56] <grumbel> that might work with slopes as well
[2015/11/15 10:13:39] <grumbel> are there any editors out there that deal with slopes well?

[2015/11/15 10:22:34] <Tobbi> hrm, restarting the main loop doesn't want to work.
[2015/11/15 10:22:52] <Tobbi> I mean: Clearly it works, but it doesn't fix the problem.
[2015/11/15 10:23:10] <Tobbi> I tried clearing the menu stack which won't work either.
[2015/11/15 10:25:17] <grumbel> Tobbi: MenuManager needs to be recreated
[2015/11/15 10:25:30] <Tobbi> Alright...
[2015/11/15 10:25:43] <Tobbi> grumbel: Can't I do that without restarting the main loop?
[2015/11/15 10:26:23] <grumbel> MenuManager is part of ScreenManager
[2015/11/15 10:27:01] <grumbel> Maybe, but I don't now where all the strings are hiding

[2015/11/15 10:53:11] <Tobbi> Not that I expected it to work.

[2015/11/15 10:55:24] <Tobbi> I give up for now.
[2015/11/15 10:56:07] <Tobbi> I even tried to restart the main loop which didn't work either.
[2015/11/15 10:57:40] <Karkus> Why do you need to refresh the menu?
[2015/11/15 10:58:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: Because otherwise it won't pick up new translations...
[2015/11/15 10:58:11] <Karkus> When you change language normally it works though...
[2015/11/15 10:58:19] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/11/15 10:58:22] <Tobbi> that's true...
[2015/11/15 10:58:26] <Tobbi> Let me check something.
[2015/11/15 10:58:53] <Karkus> Tobbi: It puts you back to the first (main) menu
[2015/11/15 10:59:01] <Tobbi> Yeah.

[2015/11/15 12:07:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: You can't activate the switch in edit mode
[2015/11/15 12:07:51] <mt> head8debian: there's the official docs and #arduino
[2015/11/15 12:07:53] <Tobbi> Karkus: If you press Action, it returns...
[2015/11/15 12:07:55] <brmbrmcar> Press action.
[2015/11/15 12:08:00] <Tobbi> And then press the switch.

[2015/11/15 12:08:26] <brmbrmcar> Can you not read the infoblock?
[2015/11/15 12:08:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: I updated the testcase.
[2015/11/15 12:08:51] <Tobbi> Just activate the switch and it should crash.
[2015/11/15 12:11:41] <Tobbi> Actually...
[2015/11/15 12:12:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: How do I press the switch in edit mode?
[2015/11/15 12:12:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: Press action key (left ctrl key for me)
[2015/11/15 12:13:38] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah, okay
[2015/11/15 12:13:50] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, let me try in the console
[2015/11/15 12:13:57] <Tobbi> I believe that works.
[2015/11/15 12:14:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, it doesn't crash?
[2015/11/15 12:14:20] <Tobbi> I believe so.
[2015/11/15 12:14:31] <brmbrmcar> The console does not crash it.
[2015/11/15 12:14:59] <Karkus> What does the action key actually do while in edit mode?
[2015/11/15 12:15:15] <brmbrmcar> Let Tux move again.
[2015/11/15 12:17:49] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Turn edit mode off?
[2015/11/15 12:22:14] <Karkus> Okay, I believe I understand the issue now
[2015/11/15 12:24:09] <Tobbi> I am having trouble finding the cause of this.
[2015/11/15 12:28:30] <Karkus> Tobbi: I have no idea where to look :/
[2015/11/15 12:28:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: I believe this might be some issue inside Squirrel...
[2015/11/15 12:29:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is Level.edit already set to false by pressing the action key?
[2015/11/15 12:29:08] <Tobbi> Probably?
[2015/11/15 12:29:26] <Tobbi> Actually, we could circumvent this, probably.
[2015/11/15 12:30:27] <Karkus> http://squirrel-lang.org/ works for me now
[2015/11/15 12:35:29] <Tobbi> I don't understand the issue at all.
[2015/11/15 12:36:15] <Karkus> Tobbi: Also, try restarting the level after pressing the action key while in edit mode.
[2015/11/15 12:36:23] <Tobbi> ok.
[2015/11/15 12:36:57] <Karkus> Actually, that's probably intended behaviour
[2015/11/15 12:37:21] <Karkus> Well, probably not.
[2015/11/15 12:37:34] <Tobbi> So, apparently we are still in edit mode.
[2015/11/15 12:38:33] <Karkus> Yup.
[2015/11/15 12:48:50] <grumbel> Tobbi: https://github.com/SuperTux/tinygettext/commit/d0155106c9b770f7ff28070c60f39337f12e8f47 there is no need to #ifdef that stuff out, all log callbacks are configurable

[2015/11/15 15:00:09] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: This has nothing to do with anything. This adds 1 line which isn't even code.
[2015/11/15 15:00:19] <brmbrmcar> And you forgot ci skip!
[2015/11/15 15:00:26] <Karkus> I did :(
[2015/11/15 15:00:38] <brmbrmcar> I do exactly the same.
[2015/11/15 15:00:50] <brmbrmcar> All my commits were useless.
[2015/11/15 15:01:30] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Talking about useless commits, what exactly does https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/220 do?
[2015/11/15 15:02:39] <brmbrmcar> Make Tux invincible (like when he gets a star).

[2015/11/15 15:04:41] <datahead7777> Karkus, grumbel was in, several people were talking, I saw Travis messages, etc.  head 8 debian had already said it was busy, and I agreed
[2015/11/15 15:04:53] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: But sector.Tux.make_invincible(true) does that
[2015/11/15 15:05:03] <maths22> Karkus: it will actually work on every push
[2015/11/15 15:05:12] <Karkus> datahead7777: I suppose it's more active than usual
[2015/11/15 15:05:25] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: But we need shortcuts.
[2015/11/15 15:05:26] <Karkus> maths22: To your repo?
[2015/11/15 15:05:37] <maths22> Right now
[2015/11/15 15:05:41] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: I don't know about that
[2015/11/15 15:05:53] <maths22> The idea is that it will be switched to run off of the offical
[2015/11/15 15:06:04] * maths22 hit enter too soon
[2015/11/15 15:06:08] <Karkus> maths22: Why can't we do that now?
[2015/11/15 15:06:12] <brmbrmcar> Like fire(), ice(), air() earth(), growup()
[2015/11/15 15:06:27] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Okay
[2015/11/15 15:06:31] <Karkus> Let me see
[2015/11/15 15:06:53] <maths22> Karkus: because certain aspects don't work quite right yet, and (mostly for windows) several things need to be changed besides .travis.yml
[2015/11/15 15:07:00] <brmbrmcar> invincible() was actually a full script,but it is so short...
[2015/11/15 15:07:06] <Karkus> maths22: Oh, I see
[2015/11/15 15:07:10] <maths22> I want to make sure everything works right before we merge
[2015/11/15 15:07:43] <brmbrmcar> Will tinygettext be in there?

[2015/11/15 15:10:04] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: I don't understand... what's wrong with invincible()
[2015/11/15 15:10:20] <brmbrmcar> It runs in a loop.
[2015/11/15 15:10:31] <Karkus> which one?
[2015/11/15 15:10:46] <brmbrmcar> invincible()
[2015/11/15 15:12:43] <brmbrmcar> The coin limit needs to be increased.
[2015/11/15 15:18:37] <maths22> brmbrmcar: what about tinygettext
[2015/11/15 15:18:46] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Also, what coin limit
[2015/11/15 15:19:04] * maths22 forgets that question marks are a thing
[2015/11/15 15:21:29] <brmbrmcar> Will sudo dpkg -i work straight away.
[2015/11/15 15:22:12] <brmbrmcar> THe coin limit is too low; I reached it without cheating.

[2015/11/15 15:29:16] <Tobbi> Actually, guys, there have been quite a few levels that were removed from bonus island 3 but never added somewhere else ;)
[2015/11/15 15:30:05] <brmbrmcar> Which ones?
[2015/11/15 15:31:26] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: A lot of them.
[2015/11/15 15:31:27] <Tobbi> let me check.
[2015/11/15 15:32:21] <Tobbi> Take a look at https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/levels/bonus3/changelog.txt
[2015/11/15 15:32:28] <brmbrmcar> There needs to be more target times.
[2015/11/15 15:33:25] <brmbrmcar> For Icy Island.
[2015/11/15 15:34:35] <brmbrmcar> And in Two Tiny Towers, dispensers need to be changed from auto to left.

[2015/11/15 15:47:12] <maths22> brmbrmcar: What is the coin limit?
[2015/11/15 15:47:46] <maths22> Also, if you mean will dpkg -i install tinygettext, the answer is yes
[2015/11/15 15:48:24] <brmbrmcar> 9999
[2015/11/15 15:51:00] <maths22> brmbrmcar: OK
[2015/11/15 15:51:11] <brmbrmcar> Which is too low.
[2015/11/15 15:51:14] <maths22> I'll have to work on hitting it sometime
[2015/11/15 15:51:19] <maths22> (No checkpoints for me)
[2015/11/15 15:51:27] <brmbrmcar> Where ist this set?
[2015/11/15 15:56:40] <brmbrmcar> I have changed in brmbrmcar:coins
[2015/11/15 16:11:58] <head8debian> Tobbi: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/1105f486/
[2015/11/15 16:12:14] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I think the better question to ask is: why do we have a coin limit?
[2015/11/15 16:12:36] <maths22> Is there a reason to keep it and increase it, or should it be eliminated?
[2015/11/15 16:12:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: does it work?
[2015/11/15 16:12:56] <maths22> head8debian: what is that for?
[2015/11/15 16:13:14] <brmbrmcar> To stop cheats.
[2015/11/15 16:13:32] <maths22> What kind of cheats does it stop?
[2015/11/15 16:14:05] <brmbrmcar> I don't know, someone who wants a load of checkpoints.
[2015/11/15 16:14:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't have the resistors for my photocells, so i don't know... :-/
[2015/11/15 16:14:19] <head8debian> maths22: An arduino.
[2015/11/15 16:14:22] <brmbrmcar> But we should let that happen anyway.
[2015/11/15 16:14:33] <head8debian> I honestly hope it will work.
[2015/11/15 16:14:36] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/15 16:14:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: I want to *sigh* also...
[2015/11/15 16:15:09] <maths22> brmbrmcar: with the console, you can already cheat in whatever way you want
[2015/11/15 16:15:11] <brmbrmcar> *bold*
[2015/11/15 16:15:17] <head8debian> Its taken alot of my energy trying to come up with that...
[2015/11/15 16:15:28] <brmbrmcar> maths22: I know, so the limit is useless.
[2015/11/15 16:15:45] <maths22> (I actually decided to not enable the console last time I wiped my config because I kept using fire() and ghost mode
[2015/11/15 16:15:49] <maths22> Ghost mode is so much fun ...
[2015/11/15 16:16:10] <brmbrmcar> But I don't want to remove it entirely, as doing so may cause bugs.
[2015/11/15 16:16:19] <brmbrmcar> How do you enable ghost mode?
[2015/11/15 16:16:39] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It should be set to INT_MAX
[2015/11/15 16:16:50] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/15 16:17:38] <maths22> I believe it is 'sector.Tux.ghost_mode(true)', but I may remember wrong
[2015/11/15 16:19:06] <brmbrmcar> The sector ghost_mode does not exist.

[2015/11/15 19:22:16] <maths22> I'm a little bit concerned with regards to the licensing on the new worldmap Restaurated island
[2015/11/15 19:22:27] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/15 19:22:58] <Tobbi> LMH: Try to print the value of that boolean flag m_langpack_mode or something to the console and then see what might be wrong.
[2015/11/15 19:23:13] <maths22> The fan site does not appear to have required uploaders to grant any rights to SuperTux/have given any license at all
[2015/11/15 19:23:57] <Tobbi> maths22: ...and it might be fairly difficult to get the original authors to grant the licenses in retrospective.
[2015/11/15 19:24:14] <Tobbi> maths22: Can't we make the whole worldmap "all rights reserved"?
[2015/11/15 19:24:27] <maths22> Tobbi: I don't disagree
[2015/11/15 19:24:43] <maths22> My concern is mostly with the "credit-taking" done in the intial level
[2015/11/15 19:24:57] <Tobbi> That will be fixed. LMH is working on it.
[2015/11/15 19:25:02] <maths22> Tobbi: great
[2015/11/15 19:25:04] <Tobbi> Or rather, has agreed to work on that.
[2015/11/15 19:25:09] <Tobbi> maths22: hume overshot a little.
[2015/11/15 19:25:42] <LMH> yeah, I didn't even think about the licensing
[2015/11/15 19:25:44] <maths22> Tobbi: we actually probably need to put something on that worldmap which explicitly "un-GPLs" it
[2015/11/15 19:25:56] <Tobbi> Yeah...
[2015/11/15 19:26:34] <Tobbi> maths22: On the other hand: If it's not under the GPL that means that hume had no rights to modify the contents of the levels in the first place.
[2015/11/15 19:26:43] <maths22> Tobbi: that is also probably true
[2015/11/15 19:27:04] <Tobbi> So, the legally right way would be to remove the worldmap altogether.
[2015/11/15 19:27:11] <maths22> Tobbi: that is actually correct
[2015/11/15 19:27:21] <maths22> We could distribute them unmodified, but then they would be unplayable
[2015/11/15 19:27:24] <LMH> anyone have access to the originals?  I'd like to know if any licensing was with the originals
[2015/11/15 19:27:43] <Tobbi> Many of them are on http://a062.apm.etc.tu-bs.de/pmlvls.php
[2015/11/15 19:27:58] <maths22> LMH: most of them don't seem to have licensing attached
[2015/11/15 19:27:59] <Tobbi> I even believe all of them.
[2015/11/15 19:28:21] <maths22> Tobbi: what do you mean?
[2015/11/15 19:28:32] <Tobbi> maths22: I believe all of them are from the fan site above.
[2015/11/15 19:28:46] <LMH> well, then the safe thing is to simply remove the addon
[2015/11/15 19:28:47] <maths22> Tobbi: given the intro, I think that is correct
[2015/11/15 19:28:55] <maths22> LMH: I sadly agree
[2015/11/15 19:29:00] <Tobbi> It's a shame, really...
[2015/11/15 19:29:16] <maths22> Especially given the work put into transforming them
[2015/11/15 19:29:18] <LMH> bah- wish I had thought of that first instead of cleaning up that intro
[2015/11/15 19:29:33] <maths22> LMH: actually, if possible, it should be removed from the git history and force pushed
[2015/11/15 19:30:23] <LMH> I can do that, might be messy for those who use the repo, but that should only be a few
[2015/11/15 19:31:06] <maths22> I agree, but that way we are defintely safe
[2015/11/15 19:31:08] <Not-6fa5> [02supertux] 03Success. The Travis CI build passed - 13https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux/builds/91295562
[2015/11/15 19:31:31] <maths22> LMH: By the way, I really like Fiona's world
[2015/11/15 19:31:43] <maths22> It's fun for if I want a worldmap that is easy to play through
[2015/11/15 19:31:55] <maths22> (Hume has some nice ones for the other end of the spectrum...)
[2015/11/15 19:32:07] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/15 19:34:39] <maths22> Also, if there is an updated fan site ever, any submissions should be required to be CC licensed
[2015/11/15 19:34:40] <LMH> maths22: thanks! that was the idea
[2015/11/15 19:34:49] <LMH> agreed
[2015/11/15 19:35:02] <maths22> (I think the CC license is more appropriate for levels than the GPL)
[2015/11/15 19:35:17] <LMH> of course the fan site was never an official piece of the project
[2015/11/15 19:35:17] <maths22> Since levels aren't source code, the GPL doesn't apply very well
[2015/11/15 19:35:28] <Tobbi> Couldn't we have our own site where people are allowed to upload their creations?
[2015/11/15 19:35:30] <maths22> LMH: I know
[2015/11/15 19:35:42] <maths22> Tobbi: yes
[2015/11/15 19:35:42] <LMH> Tobbi: that would be great
[2015/11/15 19:35:50] <Tobbi> I have been thinking about this, and it could integrate as well with the flexlay editor.
[2015/11/15 19:36:03] <Tobbi> Aka, allow people to upload levels directly from flexlay.
[2015/11/15 19:36:22] <maths22> Tobbi: if we have a clear vision, I am happy to work on the web-half implementation (and could probably provide the hosting)
[2015/11/15 19:36:24] <LMH> that would be cool
[2015/11/15 19:36:44] <Tobbi> maths22: Actually, file an issue against flexlay...
[2015/11/15 19:36:58] <Tobbi> maths22: How would the upload part look? POST?
[2015/11/15 19:37:12] <Tobbi> Sending a POST request from Python might be good.
[2015/11/15 19:37:18] <maths22> Tobbi: probably
[2015/11/15 19:37:18] <Tobbi> Or whatever there is.
[2015/11/15 19:37:37] <maths22> We would probably want to require authentication
[2015/11/15 19:37:43] <Tobbi> http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/ :P
[2015/11/15 19:37:47] <Tobbi> So, that's covered.
[2015/11/15 19:38:13] <maths22> Well, I'm off to dinner now
[2015/11/15 19:38:19] <Tobbi> sure.
[2015/11/15 19:38:20] <maths22> Good night to those of you in Europe
[2015/11/15 19:38:25] <Tobbi> good night.
[2015/11/15 19:38:30] <maths22> What time is it where you are?
[2015/11/15 19:39:18] <Tobbi> 1:37am
[2015/11/15 19:39:30] <maths22> 6:37 pm here
[2015/11/15 19:39:46] <LMH> 2:37 pm  here
[2015/11/15 19:40:40] <Tobbi> We're distributed all over the world, alright.
[2015/11/15 19:41:01] <maths22> I think it's kind of fun
[2015/11/15 19:41:10] <LMH> indeed
[2015/11/15 19:41:58] <Tobbi> So, I suggest a review queue where people from the team can review them before pushing them to the add-on repository...
[2015/11/15 19:42:00] <Tobbi> and stuff like that.
[2015/11/15 19:42:06] <Tobbi> But this is a huge undertaking anyway.
[2015/11/15 19:43:31] <maths22> A project for when I finish nightly builds
[2015/11/15 19:43:37] <maths22> :)
[2015/11/15 19:44:05] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/15 19:44:07] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/15 19:44:09] <Tobbi> Anyway, good night.
[2015/11/15 19:44:32] <LMH> we could tap into the community, let them rate levels and when they are seen as popular/stable enough we snag them for the repo
[2015/11/15 19:44:40] <LMH> oh, sorry good night
[2015/11/15 19:46:37] <Tobbi> LMH: That could work as well. But that's for post-0.4.0
[2015/11/15 19:47:06] <LMH> agreed
[2015/11/15 19:47:52] <Tobbi> LMH: So, can you file issues against the add-ons repository re. website etc.?
[2015/11/15 19:49:23] <LMH> Tobbi, I'm working on a full removal from the history, think we should tighten up access to that repo?
[2015/11/15 19:49:44] <Tobbi> LMH: We could. I believe HUme would complain, though.
[2015/11/15 19:49:53] <Tobbi> We just need to make sure that he sticks to the rules.
[2015/11/15 19:53:44] <LMH> he didn't follow the format either- we'll have to ask that he has anything reviewed first
[2015/11/15 19:54:18] <LMH> the addon repo is a little harder to deal with, requires some advanced knowledge
[2015/11/15 19:55:44] <Tobbi> I had trouble with it as well...
[2015/11/15 19:56:51] <LMH> I know, it is not trivial to work with- took me some time after it was remade to work properly
[2015/11/15 19:58:18] <Tobbi> LMH: But if we had a proper website with a backend, that would make things easier. We could create all the values automatically.
[2015/11/15 19:58:50] <LMH> that's true, would save me a lot of time when changing addons
[2015/11/15 20:09:09] @ Quit: Tobbi: 
[2015/11/15 20:30:42] <maths22> A proper website would be a very nice thing, and a nice future project
[2015/11/15 20:33:26] <maths22> Also, do we have a proper 0.4.0 todo list?
[2015/11/15 20:35:28] <LMH> maths22: I have not checked the todos for some time so honestly I'm not sure what state they are in.  I do agree that the website could use a bit of an overhaul.

[2015/11/15 21:42:38] <head8debian> maths22: Propper website? We just overhauled the current one (supertux.github.io) this spring.

[2015/11/15 21:46:14] <head8debian> frankly*

[2015/11/16 12:56:53] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Was there any discussion about Restaured Island I removal?
[2015/11/16 12:57:10] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Not that I'm aware of.
[2015/11/16 12:58:06] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Someone has to explain LMH what the Restaurator Island I is. He is often not there unfortunately.
[2015/11/16 12:58:39] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Yes.
[2015/11/16 12:58:47] <Hume2> We should reformulate the red part to make it clear to LMH.
[2015/11/16 12:59:13] <Hume2> Could you help me? Just write me a text file and I'll put it into the infoblocks.
[2015/11/16 12:59:27] <brmbrmcar> OK...
[2015/11/16 12:59:39] <brmbrmcar> So about the copyright stuff?
[2015/11/16 12:59:47] <Hume2> Yes, exactly.
[2015/11/16 13:00:23] <Hume2> I don't know the law terms in the other languages, so that's why I ask you to do it.

[2015/11/16 13:37:59] <brmbrmcar> Ok.
[2015/11/16 13:38:10] <brmbrmcar> I am restauring the next level.

[2015/11/16 13:44:19] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Thanks, but I still had some notes for levels 6 and 7.
[2015/11/16 13:44:51] <brmbrmcar> I thought I'd have to finish 7.
[2015/11/16 13:45:03] <brmbrmcar> The empty bonus blocks...
[2015/11/16 13:45:50] <Hume2> Well...
[2015/11/16 13:46:03] <brmbrmcar> I shall fix now.
[2015/11/16 13:46:36] <brmbrmcar> What shall I replace them with?
[2015/11/16 13:47:14] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It's hard to explain when you can't see me while working on it.
[2015/11/16 13:47:34] <brmbrmcar> Snow?
[2015/11/16 13:47:48] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes. You know me :D
[2015/11/16 13:48:23] <Hume2> I'll give you some examples of proper terrain: snow, darksow, forest ground, stone brick walls ...
[2015/11/16 13:49:16] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: You can't get bellow those blocks, so the empty space bellow them is useless.
[2015/11/16 13:50:10] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Do you know Narreland? There's one strange thing that is in most of the Narreland levels. Do you know what is it?
[2015/11/16 13:50:38] <brmbrmcar> Is it the snow covering the feet?
[2015/11/16 13:51:05] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: That's hard to say.
[2015/11/16 13:51:39] <brmbrmcar> What is it then?
[2015/11/16 13:51:52] <Hume2> I make it usually not-covering the feet, because of the flames.
[2015/11/16 13:52:19] <Hume2> When you set the z-pos of interactive layer to 51, it covers the feet...
[2015/11/16 13:53:02] <Hume2> ...but it covers also all the flames, so they hide in the terrain and it's tricky to pass them.

[2015/11/16 13:58:18] <Hume2> It's contraproductive. So I'll remove the red part.

[2015/11/16 15:20:52] <maths22> You posted it above
[2015/11/16 15:23:14] <brmbrmcar> I made it myself.
[2015/11/16 15:23:38] <brmbrmcar> Noone owns any rights tyo it.
[2015/11/16 15:24:05] <maths22> brmbrmcar: My quesiton is because, at least under US copyright law, it is not really correct
[2015/11/16 15:24:33] <maths22> For something to qualify as "fair use" in the US, it must satisfy 4 conditions in some combination
[2015/11/16 15:24:47] <maths22> (US copyright law is confusing, but here is the basic idea)
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the purpose and character of your use
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the nature of the copyrighted work
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and
[2015/11/16 15:24:55] <maths22> the effect of the use upon the potential market.
[2015/11/16 15:25:07] <brmbrmcar> Yeah, but think of it this way: if we were that strict on copyright, everything would be banned.
[2015/11/16 15:25:12] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Nope
[2015/11/16 15:25:19] <maths22> Most of our stuff has a CC license
[2015/11/16 15:25:22] <maths22> that lets us use it
[2015/11/16 15:25:49] <maths22> By default, we cannot use anything-permission must be explicitly granted (except for the specific carve-outs for "fair use")
[2015/11/16 15:25:54] <brmbrmcar> And also, how does this apply internationally?
[2015/11/16 15:26:15] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I can look into that, that said, I assume we want to be allowed to distribute the game in the US
[2015/11/16 15:26:38] <brmbrmcar> Exactly.
[2015/11/16 15:26:47] <brmbrmcar> It needs to be legal everywhere.
[2015/11/16 15:27:31] <maths22> CC licenses are "certified" as internationally valid
[2015/11/16 15:27:59] <brmbrmcar> THink of it this way: if Hukme
[2015/11/16 15:28:00] <maths22> (The GPL, while also internationally valid, does not apply to levels, which are really data not source code)
[2015/11/16 15:28:20] <brmbrmcar> randomally created those levels, would that be illegel?
[2015/11/16 15:28:34] <maths22> brmbrmcar: no, but that is irrelevant
[2015/11/16 15:28:50] <maths22> It is a known fact that they were created from the fan site levels
[2015/11/16 15:29:11] <maths22> His ability to create them independently does not make them any less tied to the originals
[2015/11/16 15:30:11] <brmbrmcar> But it is relevant, nbecause it is exactly the same.
[2015/11/16 15:30:29] <brmbrmcar> The proccess is not important.
[2015/11/16 15:30:35] <maths22> brmbrmcar: That is not true
[2015/11/16 15:30:50] <maths22> If I looked at the fan site levels, and Hume's levels, they would clearly be related
[2015/11/16 15:31:02] <maths22> Further, we have documentation, in several forms, that they are related
[2015/11/16 15:31:18] <maths22> Therefore, legally, Hume's levels are a derivative work of the original
[2015/11/16 15:32:20] <brmbrmcar> OK then. You win.
[2015/11/16 15:32:36] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I feel sorry for Hume, because I can tell he put a lot of work into the levels
[2015/11/16 15:32:43] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2015/11/16 15:33:12] <brmbrmcar> And I tried restoring some levels, and it isn't as easy as it sounds.
[2015/11/16 15:33:41] <maths22> LMH, Tobbi, and I discussed it last night, and collectively determined that, at least without consulting a lawyer, it would not be a good idea to keep the addon as part of the project
[2015/11/16 15:35:45] <brmbrmcar> :(

[2015/11/16 17:19:00] <maths22> Tobbi: the "metal" ones don't really look out of place in an icy world
[2015/11/16 17:19:09] <maths22> I can't say the same about the wooden ones
[2015/11/16 17:19:13] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/16 17:19:24] <Tobbi> I think the wooden ones look rather ugly...
[2015/11/16 17:19:41] <maths22> To me, the cannons work, but if someone wanted, they could add some icicles or something like that
[2015/11/16 17:19:48] <maths22> Tobbi: I must agree on the wooden ones
[2015/11/16 17:20:04] <maths22> It does not help that half of the levels that use them just have them floating in the air
[2015/11/16 17:20:09] <Tobbi> Sometimes we don't want to show any dispenser...
[2015/11/16 17:20:19] <maths22> In my opinion, they should be ceiling mounted, in a cloud, or invisible
[2015/11/16 17:20:25] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/16 17:20:34] <Tobbi> But in a cloud, we sometimes don't want the dispenser to be visible.
[2015/11/16 17:20:36] <maths22> Also, why does fireflower no longer destroy dispensers?
[2015/11/16 17:20:44] <Tobbi> Change made by hume someday.
[2015/11/16 17:20:47] <maths22> Tobbi: In theory, the cloud should cover up the dispenser
[2015/11/16 17:21:05] <Tobbi> maths22: It does, but I'd rather have a flag on the dispenser that sets it to hidden.
[2015/11/16 17:21:06] <maths22> Tobbi: Same with why it doesn't destroy crystallo?
[2015/11/16 17:21:15] <Tobbi> Because fire shouldn
[2015/11/16 17:21:19] <Tobbi> 't melt a crystal.
[2015/11/16 17:21:23] <maths22> Tobbi: this is true
[2015/11/16 17:21:26] <Tobbi> But that's also a change hume introduced.
[2015/11/16 17:21:51] <maths22> Then again, fire also shouldn't melt the spiky shells, but we kind of have to ignore that
[2015/11/16 17:22:17] <maths22> Also, in my opinion, the new forest jumpy graphics are not the most attractive
[2015/11/16 17:22:25] <Tobbi> True...
[2015/11/16 17:22:30] <Tobbi> Maybe we should reset them?
[2015/11/16 17:22:41] <maths22> Tobbi: the metal ones didn't look out of place
[2015/11/16 17:22:57] <Tobbi> maths22: Yes, I agree... can you undo the changes?
[2015/11/16 17:23:11] <maths22> Tobbi: not right now, but I will try to remember for later
[2015/11/16 17:23:17] <Tobbi> Or I could.
[2015/11/16 17:23:20] <Tobbi> I'll have to see..
[2015/11/16 17:27:12] <Tobbi> maths22: Do I keep the sprites themselves for reference or do I revert that commit as well?

[2015/11/17 10:40:00] <brmbrmcar> Any news on that retaured island 1?
[2015/11/17 10:40:33] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I changed everything needed, but didn't posted anything so far.
[2015/11/17 10:41:10] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: OK, then.
[2015/11/17 10:41:44] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I thought a new path mode, unordered.
[2015/11/17 10:41:51] <brmbrmcar> Apparently there was a discussion about it, but it was in the middle of the night.
[2015/11/17 10:41:57] <brmbrmcar> The path mode?
[2015/11/17 10:42:15] <Hume2> You know, we have circular, pingpong and oneshot.
[2015/11/17 10:42:27] <Hume2> Circular is default.
[2015/11/17 10:42:51] <brmbrmcar> Ah. Sothat.
[2015/11/17 10:43:09] <brmbrmcar> I always found it hard using paths.
[2015/11/17 10:43:29] <Hume2> Let'
[2015/11/17 10:43:54] <Hume2> Let's say that you have a platform and several places where it should go.
[2015/11/17 10:44:03] <brmbrmcar> Does it need testing before it can be merged?
[2015/11/17 10:44:16] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: No, but Tobbi could rage :D
[2015/11/17 10:44:49] <Hume2> I know that he doesn't rage, but he says "*sigh*".
[2015/11/17 10:45:02] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: ok, lets keep him calm.
[2015/11/17 10:46:56] <Hume2> I think that this mode could be useful for scripting.
[2015/11/17 10:49:10] <brmbrmcar> Yes, I agree.
[2015/11/17 10:50:04] <brmbrmcar> And also, it isn't as much hassle because the level editor is no longer maintained.

[2015/11/17 10:53:58] <Hume2> It's now kind of harder work... I have to add many classes...
[2015/11/17 10:54:18] <Hume2> That's why I have time for level design but not for editor.
[2015/11/17 10:54:58] <brmbrmcar> Level editors must be hard to make!
[2015/11/17 10:55:00] <Hume2> The worst is that it's not hard at all, but it's much writing.
[2015/11/17 10:55:33] <brmbrmcar> Yes. You have to get it to input everything.
[2015/11/17 10:55:46] <Hume2> Exactly.
[2015/11/17 10:56:05] <Hume2> Well, my plan:
[2015/11/17 10:56:48] <Hume2> After 0.4.0 will be released, I'll move the editor branch to origin, so everyone could contribute.
[2015/11/17 10:57:13] <brmbrmcar> Yay!
[2015/11/17 10:58:03] <brmbrmcar> Is there any talk of a release date for 0.4.0? Because some people will be dying to know....
[2015/11/17 10:58:36] <Hume2> I don't know anything else except that it'll be on X-mas 2015.
[2015/11/17 10:58:46] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/17 10:58:55] <brmbrmcar> When all the bugs are fixed.
[2015/11/17 10:59:28] <Hume2> That would take much longer time.
[2015/11/17 11:00:29] <brmbrmcar> Yes, completely.
[2015/11/17 11:01:16] <Hume2> Do you know, what I did with the switches recently?
[2015/11/17 11:01:26] <Hume2> It was today.
[2015/11/17 11:01:38] <brmbrmcar> Made them bi something
[2015/11/17 11:02:02] <brmbrmcar> bistable
[2015/11/17 11:02:35] <Hume2> Yes. Thay can be now used to turn something on and off.
[2015/11/17 11:02:52] <brmbrmcar> Nice!
[2015/11/17 11:03:07] <Hume2> This could be done before, but now the lever is down when it's turned on.
[2015/11/17 11:03:26] <brmbrmcar> THat is more clear.
[2015/11/17 11:03:35] <Hume2> It's in Magic Block Test.
[2015/11/17 11:04:31] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2015/11/17 11:04:40] <brmbrmcar> Will people useit?

[2015/11/17 11:11:37] <Hume2> sector.Tux.set_bonus(<bonus>) should work.
[2015/11/17 11:13:03] <brmbrmcar> The index no longer exists...

[2015/11/17 11:45:15] <Hume2> Karkus: Do you know what bistability is?
[2015/11/17 11:46:10] <Hume2> You can set an off-script and the switch is bistable then. When you don't set it, it acts as before.
[2015/11/17 11:46:27] <Hume2> And I opened a pull request.
[2015/11/17 11:50:02] <brmbrmcar> It can't be merged yet.
[2015/11/17 11:50:47] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Well, if someone tests it, I can.
[2015/11/17 11:51:14] <Karkus> Hume2: Okay, I get it
[2015/11/17 11:51:43] <Hume2> Karkus: Did you get what that means or you tested it?
[2015/11/17 11:51:55] <Karkus> Hume2: I understand the meaning
[2015/11/17 11:52:01] <Hume2> OK
[2015/11/17 11:52:01] <Karkus> Do you want me to test it?
[2015/11/17 11:52:15] <Hume2> That would be good.
[2015/11/17 11:52:38] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: You don't want to make Tobbi angery...
[2015/11/17 11:53:13] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: He decides faster when more people test it.

[2015/11/17 11:54:08] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: I k-now.
[2015/11/17 11:54:16] <Hume2> Karkus, yes, it is.
[2015/11/17 11:54:39] <Hume2> We are talking about merging, that can make Tobbi angry :D
[2015/11/17 11:54:54] <brmbrmcar> Why though?
[2015/11/17 11:55:19] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: He likes to be in control of the merging
[2015/11/17 11:55:32] <Hume2> ^ This
[2015/11/17 11:55:39] <brmbrmcar> He thinks he's in control of all Supertux.
[2015/11/17 11:55:56] <Karkus> Hume2: This does not appear to be related to Bistable switches
[2015/11/17 11:56:06] <Hume2> I know.
[2015/11/17 11:56:17] <Hume2> Bistable switches are in master.
[2015/11/17 11:56:23] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: And at the moment, he might as well be. He has worked to keep this project going
[2015/11/17 11:56:34] <Karkus> Hume2: You pushed straight to master???
[2015/11/17 11:56:50] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: Hume2:master
[2015/11/17 11:57:23] <Hume2> For bistable switches: They don't affect gameplay at all, because they are never used.
[2015/11/17 11:57:54] <brmbrmcar> Oh yeah.THose.
[2015/11/17 11:57:57] <Hume2> ...but test it please anyway. It's in Magic Block Test.
[2015/11/17 11:58:03] <brmbrmcar> This is confusing...
[2015/11/17 11:58:53] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: Any progress?
[2015/11/17 11:59:02] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: With...?
[2015/11/17 11:59:42] <Hume2> There are three switches in Magic Block Test. Just press them.
[2015/11/17 12:00:17] <Karkus> Hume2: Are you talking about hume2:master?
[2015/11/17 12:00:17] <Hume2> This may have higher priority than the unordered path.
[2015/11/17 12:00:28] <brmbrmcar> Karkus: building the ltest version/testing it.
[2015/11/17 12:00:41] <Hume2> Karkus: Bistable switches are in origin:master.
[2015/11/17 12:01:01] <Karkus> Hume2: Okay, I will test that after
[2015/11/17 12:01:13] <Karkus> Just need to build unordered path
[2015/11/17 12:01:33] <brmbrmcar> Karkus the builder!
[2015/11/17 12:01:51] <Hume2> Karkus: You can test the bistable switches in the same build.
[2015/11/17 12:02:37] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: So the scripts are independent?
[2015/11/17 12:02:39] <Karkus> Hume2: Are they in unordered_path branch?
[2015/11/17 12:04:31] <Hume2> Karkus: Unordered path is in hume2:unordered_path and bistable switches are in both.
[2015/11/17 12:04:40] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes.
[2015/11/17 12:05:28] <Karkus> Hume2: Is there a test level for bistable switches?

[2015/11/17 12:40:39] <brmbrmcar> invincible() is a script, not a function.

[2015/11/17 12:43:23] <brmbrmcar> An insane one is kill Tux when the level is finished.
[2015/11/17 12:46:10] <maths22> brmbrmcar: this is true.  However,  I think we should kill Tux when the level starts; then all levels are perfect since no one can play any of them :)

[2015/11/17 13:24:53] <Hume2> And I got that there are easter eggs in some forest levels.
[2015/11/17 13:26:26] <brmbrmcar> Ahoj, tady Hume2, co tomu ?k??
[2015/11/17 13:26:36] <Hume2> Yes.
[2015/11/17 13:27:04] <Hume2> In the WolfgangB's levels, there are texts made of invisible blocks saying "W.B.6/2006"
[2015/11/17 13:27:11] <brmbrmcar> What does it mean?
[2015/11/17 13:27:42] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: It means: "Hello, here's Hume2, what do you say to this?"
[2015/11/17 13:28:38] <brmbrmcar> Nice.

[2015/11/17 17:53:37] <Karkus> Why?
[2015/11/17 17:54:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: Just saying. :P I am not expecting German comments at all :D
[2015/11/17 17:55:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: I misinterpreted the "from you"
[2015/11/17 17:55:08] <Tobbi> Ah, right.
[2015/11/17 17:55:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: Was sind drei Nazis in der Ecke?

[2015/11/17 17:55:38] <Karkus> Ich
[2015/11/17 17:55:51] <Tobbi> Karkus: Ein rechter Winkel.
[2015/11/17 17:56:57] <Tobbi> Okay, it only makes proper sense in German.
[2015/11/17 17:56:59] * Karkus thinks, and then looks up "Winkel"

[2015/11/17 17:57:24] <Karkus> Oh
[2015/11/17 17:57:25] <Karkus> I get it
[2015/11/17 17:57:46] <Karkus> Ecke is corner?

[2015/11/17 17:58:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: Correct.
[2015/11/17 17:58:37] <Karkus> I have a feeling I've heard a similar English joke
[2015/11/17 18:00:23] <Tobbi> Geht ein Vergewaltiger mit einem kleinen Jungen in den Wald. Sagt der Junge "Ganz schÃ¶n gruselig hier", sagt der Vergewaltiger "Was soll ich denn sagen, ich muss nachher alleine nach Hause".
[2015/11/17 18:03:51] <Karkus> Vergewaltiger?
[2015/11/17 18:04:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: rapist.
[2015/11/17 18:04:48] <Karkus> Tobbi: I wonder why I don't know that word?

[2015/11/17 18:14:35] <Tobbi> Yes, definitely.

[2015/11/17 18:16:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats that stand for? Emitting steam out of a smoke stack?
[2015/11/17 18:16:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: Should we notify the user of https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/228 util we fix it?
[2015/11/17 18:16:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: I did that already.... https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commit/adeb18125f971f681d5d8e9d0c6cab87d42db5e8
[2015/11/17 18:17:12] <Tobbi> "Please restart SuperTux for these changes to take effect." is proper English, isn't it?
[2015/11/17 18:17:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: Perfect English
[2015/11/17 18:17:50] <Tobbi> Good
[2015/11/17 18:18:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: When does this appear?
[2015/11/17 18:18:11] <Karkus> When you change language?
[2015/11/17 18:18:12] <Tobbi> Karkus: upon enabling / disabling a language pack.
[2015/11/17 18:18:24] <Tobbi> Actually...I wonder what happens if you install language packs for the first time.
[2015/11/17 18:18:53] <Karkus> What is a language pack? Is this a new thing?
[2015/11/17 18:19:09] <Tobbi> Karkus: An add-on that contains new strings.
[2015/11/17 18:19:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: Seperate to the actual addons?
[2015/11/17 18:19:28] <Tobbi> Aka, new .po files.

[2015/11/17 18:20:13] <Tobbi> Take a look at https://github.com/SuperTux/addons/tree/master/src/langpack-de
[2015/11/17 18:21:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah, I see. Is this one installed automatically then? (Seeing halloween 2014 there)
[2015/11/17 18:21:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: No, you need to check for them.
[2015/11/17 18:21:58] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/17 18:21:58] <Tobbi> Installing automatically can get difficult.

[2015/11/17 18:26:18] <Karkus> Tobbi: Here's a question: Why are the language names on the language list all in English?
[2015/11/17 18:26:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, that can be changed easily.
[2015/11/17 18:26:40] <Tobbi> It was / is merely a test.
[2015/11/17 18:27:05] <Karkus> I think we should put a small globe button on the main menu to change language, rather than navigating through in a foreign one
[2015/11/17 18:27:18] <Tobbi> Sure, go ahead.
[2015/11/17 18:27:33] <Karkus> Okay
[2015/11/17 18:28:30] <leper`> but that takes all the fun away, you'll never have to remember which item in the menu was the correct one when you set the game to a language where you can't even read the letters

[2015/11/18 10:52:01] <brmbrmcar> Hi!
[2015/11/18 10:55:37] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Any idea what LMH means by "check with others first"?
[2015/11/18 10:55:51] @ tuxdev_ joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/18 10:55:57] <Hume2> ...for Restaured Island I.
[2015/11/18 10:56:55] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: Nooo.#
[2015/11/18 10:57:33] <brmbrmcar> He already discussed it himself.
[2015/11/18 10:58:03] <Hume2> Let's do it this way. Do you know anyone who hasn't tested it so far?
[2015/11/18 10:58:16] <Hume2> Well, I tested it.
[2015/11/18 10:58:31] <Hume2> It looks like Tobbi has tested it as well.
[2015/11/18 10:58:42] <brmbrmcar> I tested it, of course.
[2015/11/18 10:59:31] <Hume2> That's what I expected. It looks like Max Teufel has tested it too.
[2015/11/18 10:59:51] <Hume2> ...beacuse he had some notes to it.
[2015/11/18 11:00:39] <brmbrmcar> I just cheated the whole thing, so I could test every level without spending time getting past tricky parts.
[2015/11/18 11:01:09] <brmbrmcar> And I stand with what I have said; the levels are heavily modified.
[2015/11/18 11:01:11] <Hume2> That's what I did with Dark world.
[2015/11/18 11:01:43] <Hume2> So the licencing is OK.
[2015/11/18 11:02:06] <Hume2> You will be in special thanks after it will be added again.
[2015/11/18 11:02:28] <brmbrmcar> It will be added. I am determind.

[2015/11/18 11:03:49] <Hume2> I think that Karkus looks like he wouldn't pass it untested. I'll ask him.
[2015/11/18 11:04:29] <Hume2> leyyin_: Did you tested Restaured Island I until LMH deleted it?
[2015/11/18 11:04:35] <brmbrmcar> Karkus will probably be here soon.
[2015/11/18 11:04:51] <leyyin_> Hume2, no, sorry
[2015/11/18 11:05:27] <brmbrmcar> Aw.

[2015/11/18 11:07:11] <Hume2> It's the old version. The new vesion differs only by the intro and extro.
[2015/11/18 11:09:09] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/18 11:09:18] <brmbrmcar> Where new one?
[2015/11/18 11:09:30] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I'll add it now.

[2015/11/18 11:29:22] <maths22> We have no right to do anything with the fan site levels
[2015/11/18 11:29:44] <maths22> They did not grant us a license, and heavy modification simply makes them a derivative work

[2015/11/18 11:30:30] <maths22> We may not like that, and I really appreciate the effort that was put into the worldmap, but that doesn't make it legal

[2015/11/18 11:32:13] <maths22> What did not make sense about that argument?
[2015/11/18 11:32:13] <brmbrmcar> But we still disagree.
[2015/11/18 11:32:22] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Was any license specifies
[2015/11/18 11:32:23] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I thought we had ended in agreement.
[2015/11/18 11:32:28] <Karkus> specified?
[2015/11/18 11:32:36] <brmbrmcar> maths22: Yes, that one.
[2015/11/18 11:32:50] <maths22> brmbrmcar: then how do we disagree
[2015/11/18 11:32:53] <maths22> ?
[2015/11/18 11:33:25] <brmbrmcar> Arguing and disagreeing are different.
[2015/11/18 11:33:41] <maths22> By argument, I meant claim
[2015/11/18 11:33:45] <maths22> not debate
[2015/11/18 11:34:17] <brmbrmcar> You are very confusing.
[2015/11/18 11:34:20] <maths22> Karkus: the fan site has no grant of license, and the levels I checked do not have licenses attached
[2015/11/18 11:34:41] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I'm sorry.  I was trying to be clear, but evidently I failed
[2015/11/18 11:34:45] <Karkus> maths22: Can I have a link to the fan site?
[2015/11/18 11:34:58] <Karkus> maths22: Made sense to me...
[2015/11/18 11:35:04] <maths22> Karkus: http://a062.apm.etc.tu-bs.de/pmlvls.php?frn=0&snr=30&ord=odif
[2015/11/18 11:35:44] <Hume2> mats22: What country are you from?
[2015/11/18 11:35:59] <maths22> Hume2: United States
[2015/11/18 11:36:19] <maths22> That said, this aspect of copyright is fairly similar in the EU to the best of my knowledge
[2015/11/18 11:36:37] <Hume2> It is similar but not the same.
[2015/11/18 11:37:00] <maths22> Hume2: I know.  Hence why I defered to LMH and Tobbi for a european perspective
[2015/11/18 11:37:30] <brmbrmcar> And you can't copyright everything.
[2015/11/18 11:37:42] <mt> (in Germany) If there's no license specified it is to assume that the original creator has all the rights until 70 years after their death
[2015/11/18 11:38:04] <brmbrmcar> If copyright was this bad, nothing would belegal.
[2015/11/18 11:38:10] <maths22> brmbrmcar: that is not true
[2015/11/18 11:38:39] <maths22> You can use things without violating copyright
[2015/11/18 11:38:49] <maths22> You can even often modify them for personal use
[2015/11/18 11:39:15] <maths22> But you can't modify and distribute them without some kind of permission from the original copyright holder
[2015/11/18 11:39:28] <maths22> Hence why in the open source world, we use licenses
[2015/11/18 11:39:29] <head8debian> maths22: Exactly.
[2015/11/18 11:39:40] <Hume2> maths22: Read the new intro.
[2015/11/18 11:39:45] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but if things were like this and you copyrighted maths22, you would never be allowed to say the word maths.
[2015/11/18 11:40:01] <head8debian> oh brother...
[2015/11/18 11:40:21] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I cannot copyright maths22 even if I wanted to
[2015/11/18 11:40:26] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Trade names are trade marks.
[2015/11/18 11:40:43] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Copyright protects intellectual property
[2015/11/18 11:40:46] <maths22> I might be able to trademark it, so someone else couldn't claim to be me and do buisness as me
[2015/11/18 11:40:54] <brmbrmcar> It is purely an  example.
[2015/11/18 11:41:15] <maths22> The principle is that copyright protects the specific execution of an idea, and not the idea itself
[2015/11/18 11:41:28] <Hume2> Please stop this empty discussion and read the new intro. https://github.com/Hume2/addons/blob/6461cbcd31e7dafd6e255540bbb2dbbf9a2fc91b/src/restaurator1/levels/restaurator1/intro.txt
[2015/11/18 11:41:50] <maths22> Hume2: that is an unfounded claim
[2015/11/18 11:41:57] <maths22> It is clearly a derivative work
[2015/11/18 11:41:58] <mt> derivations of works are *not* legal
[2015/11/18 11:42:11] <mt> (without the permission of the copyright holder)
[2015/11/18 11:42:13] <maths22> You even say that yourself by saying that there *is* an original author
[2015/11/18 11:42:29] <maths22> As a derivative work, it does not somehow lose the original copyright
[2015/11/18 11:42:45] <maths22> It actually can only exist if the original copyright holder has granted permission for it
[2015/11/18 11:43:18] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/18 11:43:29] <brmbrmcar> Well, it is in plan English.
[2015/11/18 11:44:12] <maths22> head8debian: you can see why I am tired of this conversation///
[2015/11/18 11:44:21] <maths22> (That was supposed to be an elipsis)
[2015/11/18 11:45:10] <Hume2> Taking the idea of the level is legal. Have you ever compared those levels with the my ones?
[2015/11/18 11:45:18] <brmbrmcar> Well, no one complained before the subject was brought up.
[2015/11/18 11:46:12] <brmbrmcar> ume2: Exactly.
[2015/11/18 11:46:39] <Hume2> Well, let's make some rules for complaining.
[2015/11/18 11:46:53] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/18 11:46:54] <mt> If you say you took the idea of a level you're saying you took intellectual property from the original author.

[2015/11/18 11:47:42] <Hume2> Inspiration is legal, because noone can ever get where I was really inspired.
[2015/11/18 11:48:14] <Hume2> If taking the idea was illegal, then there would be no legal art work since 1900.
[2015/11/18 11:48:22] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/18 11:48:29] <maths22> Tobbi: Welcome!
[2015/11/18 11:48:29] <Tobbi> It's more than an inspiration...
[2015/11/18 11:48:34] <Tobbi> Yes, thank you.
[2015/11/18 11:48:50] <maths22> Tobbi: This is true.  We are literally citing the original author and using the original title
[2015/11/18 11:49:05] <brmbrmcar> Hume2 is right.
[2015/11/18 11:49:32] <Hume2> 80% of tiles are changed.
[2015/11/18 11:49:45] <Tobbi> The overall look isn't.
[2015/11/18 11:50:07] <Hume2> Have you compared it?
[2015/11/18 11:50:17] <maths22> Hume2: A numeric percent of tiles changed doesn't tell me anything
[2015/11/18 11:50:34] <maths22> I could get 100% tiles changed converting a level from the forest world to the ice world
[2015/11/18 11:50:45] <maths22> That wouldn't make it any less of a derivative work
[2015/11/18 11:50:56] <brmbrmcar> maths22:Yes, it does.
[2015/11/18 11:51:04] <Tobbi> ffs, no it doesn't.
[2015/11/18 11:51:11] <Tobbi> The arrangement of the tiles is significant.
[2015/11/18 11:51:15] <Tobbi> Aka, the overall look
[2015/11/18 11:51:38] <Tobbi> We have been over this...
[2015/11/18 11:51:56] <maths22> Tobbi: this is our 3rd time
[2015/11/18 11:51:56] <mt> brmbrmcar: Go ask your lawyer if you don't believe us. If you can't afford one, there's probably some subreddit where you can ask as well
[2015/11/18 11:52:01] <Hume2> Well, LMH stole me the rotating coins :D
[2015/11/18 11:52:07] <maths22> brmbrmcar's 2nd
[2015/11/18 11:52:18] <Tobbi> So.
[2015/11/18 11:52:35] <Tobbi> Guys if you want, ask for permission with every original author...
[2015/11/18 11:52:40] <brmbrmcar> Why did you lot even start this argument?
[2015/11/18 11:52:44] <Tobbi> Though some of them will likely not be available any longer.
[2015/11/18 11:53:11] <maths22> brmbrmcar: because when I first played the worldmap, I thought to check on the licencing
[2015/11/18 11:53:19] <maths22> And noticed that it did not work
[2015/11/18 11:53:35] <maths22> Since it is a bad idea to violate copyright, I asked other peoples' opinions
[2015/11/18 11:53:54] <brmbrmcar> I can't be bothered with licenses.I would let someone modify my work.
[2015/11/18 11:54:07] <Tobbi> So that would make it PD...
[2015/11/18 11:54:19] <Tobbi> And that needs to be specified.
[2015/11/18 11:54:36] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Although it is nice to know that you would not pursue someone for copyright violation, that would not make other people any less in violation
[2015/11/18 11:54:45] <maths22> Hence why we use licences
[2015/11/18 11:55:04] <maths22> If I saw your work, and there wasn't a licence, I wouldn't take the risk of using it
[2015/11/18 11:55:05] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I would guess your original age is around 13-16 from what you wrote...
[2015/11/18 11:55:16] <Tobbi> no license = all rights reserved.
[2015/11/18 11:55:27] <maths22> How do I know that you won't come after me for copyright infringement sometime later
[2015/11/18 11:55:46] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/18 11:55:52] <brmbrmcar> So if I even think of something,you say that is copyright?
[2015/11/18 11:55:59] <Karkus> What Tobbi just said is just how it works, brmbrmcar. Don't argue with us about it
[2015/11/18 11:56:23] <maths22> brmbrmcar: No, but if you write it down, that writing is copyrighted
[2015/11/18 11:56:25] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: You need proof too
[2015/11/18 11:56:26] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Thinking of something doesn't make it art. Putting it into action does make it art.
[2015/11/18 11:56:29] <brmbrmcar> Well, then don't make a silly argument.
[2015/11/18 11:56:48] <brmbrmcar> Personal use.
[2015/11/18 11:56:51] <Karkus> *sigh*
[2015/11/18 11:57:07] <brmbrmcar> You say personal use is copyright now?
[2015/11/18 11:57:37] <Karkus> No. You can do that
[2015/11/18 11:57:54] <mt> What we do is a) not personal use and b) even copyright can apply for personal use under some jurisdictions
[2015/11/18 11:57:55] <Karkus> You cannot distribute it though, I think
[2015/11/18 11:58:04] <maths22> Karkus: this would be correct
[2015/11/18 11:58:13] <maths22> For the most part, copyright actually applies to personal use
[2015/11/18 11:58:49] <maths22> Its just that there is no way for anyone to find out
[2015/11/18 11:58:54] <brmbrmcar> And, anyway, why is the addons repository so strict?
[2015/11/18 11:59:15] <Tobbi> Okay this is enough for now.
[2015/11/18 11:59:19] <brmbrmcar> Why does it need thorough checking before adding?
[2015/11/18 11:59:23] <Karkus> This is the world, not the addons repo.
[2015/11/18 11:59:29] <maths22> Tobbi: I agree
[2015/11/18 11:59:29] <brmbrmcar> OK, this is enough.
[2015/11/18 11:59:33] <Tobbi> Good.
[2015/11/18 11:59:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/18 11:59:39] <brmbrmcar> End!
[2015/11/18 11:59:43] <brmbrmcar> For now...

[2015/11/18 13:31:07] <mt> ship a minimal WM without a lot of configuration, call /usr/bin/supertux2 in xinitrc
[2015/11/18 13:31:26] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/18 13:32:13] <brmbrmcar> Supertux OS 0.4.0
[2015/11/18 13:42:53] <head8debian> Great, i "bricked" my GPS... :p
[2015/11/18 13:48:59] <brmbrmcar> Bad!
[2015/11/18 13:54:38] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes, you can delete that level.
[2015/11/18 13:56:06] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: OK...
[2015/11/18 13:57:22] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Could we have a private talk?
[2015/11/18 13:57:27] <brmbrmcar> Aw flip...
[2015/11/18 13:57:49] <Not-6fa5> [02supertux] 07Karkus476 commented on issue 03#229: Stop doors fom blacking out the screen when they aren't being used - 13http://git.io/v4icO
[2015/11/18 13:57:52] <Tobbi> That either means something good or something very bad..
[2015/11/18 13:58:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: Doors black out the screen in case you enter them... However, you can simply not go through them, yet the screen will be blacked out for some time.
[2015/11/18 13:58:47] <Tobbi> And i believe this is what he is complaining about in that issue.
[2015/11/18 13:59:24] <Tobbi> I don't know a solution to that anyway.
[2015/11/18 13:59:46] <Tobbi> However, we could have that blackout effect just before the sector switch.
[2015/11/18 13:59:50] <Tobbi> But that adds a few seconds...
[2015/11/18 13:59:59] <Tobbi> Aka, people might be complaining about them not getting best stats.

[2015/11/18 14:02:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, you go up to a door, press up, then walk off?
[2015/11/18 14:02:53] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, basically, the screen fadeout starts once the door opens...we could make it so it starts later.
[2015/11/18 14:02:56] <Tobbi> And is shorter.
[2015/11/18 14:03:14] <brmbrmcar> That is good.
[2015/11/18 14:04:04] <Tobbi> but a lot of work, I believe.
[2015/11/18 14:04:04] <Karkus> You shouldn't be able to walk around once you've pressed up. You should freeze in place and a door entering animation should show
[2015/11/18 14:04:18] <Tobbi> Well, currently it just fades.
[2015/11/18 14:04:46] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but that is even worse.

[2015/11/19 09:03:50] <Tobbi> It works fine.
[2015/11/19 09:16:23] <Tobbi> But since it's a release candidate, I am not sure if we should use it in the final release.
[2015/11/19 09:16:26] <Tobbi> I'd rather not.

[2015/11/19 10:14:33] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/19 10:14:47] <maths22> The issue is that I have to merge the main repo into my fork
[2015/11/19 10:17:51] <grumbel> What are the near term plans for SuperTux? Is there a new release soon?
[2015/11/19 10:24:45] <Tobbi> grumbel: We plan on releasing milestone 2 next month. Probably on the 20th.
[2015/11/19 10:25:06] <Tobbi> MS 2 works stable enough so that a final release should be justified.
[2015/11/19 10:25:45] <grumbel> ok, then I'll wait with my lisp->sexp replacement till after that, as that might break a bit of stuff
[2015/11/19 10:25:58] <Tobbi> Okay, unless you can unbreak this easily. :P
[2015/11/19 10:26:20] <Tobbi> maths22: I suppose we should use Squirrel 3.0 stable instead of 3.1 release candidate? Or what do you think?
[2015/11/19 10:26:38] <Tobbi> I mean: Both is in the repository...
[2015/11/19 10:30:26] <maths22> Tobbi: I would say to stick with the stable release
[2015/11/19 10:30:31] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2015/11/19 10:30:54] <maths22> grumbel: What is this 'lisp->sexp replacement'?
[2015/11/19 10:31:15] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/19 10:31:55] <Tobbi> Maybe squirrel guys will release 3.1 as stable...
[2015/11/19 10:31:56] <grumbel> maths22: cleanup up file reading a little and replacing the lisp/ code with https://travis-ci.org/lispparser/sexp-cpp (which is a cleaned up version of code in lisp/)
[2015/11/19 10:32:35] <grumbel> better link: https://github.com/lispparser/sexp-cpp
[2015/11/19 10:33:13] <Tobbi> Did I do pull requests against those repos or did you just pull in my commits from supertux?
[2015/11/19 10:34:17] <Tobbi> never mind.

[2015/11/19 10:38:49] <Tobbi> If not, doesn't matter, we display a message to the user...
[2015/11/19 10:39:27] <maths22> grumbel: Thanks
[2015/11/19 10:40:19] <Tobbi> I could probably add a submodule in another branch for that lisp parser, couldn't I?
[2015/11/19 10:40:50] <Tobbi> Oh, wait, it might not be ready yet.
[2015/11/19 10:41:39] <grumbel> that can wait
[2015/11/19 10:41:44] <Tobbi> okay...
[2015/11/19 10:42:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: What are you guys doing?
[2015/11/19 10:42:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: Uhm, grumbel has reworked the lisp parser quite a bit...but we likely won't make it until the release of 0.4.0...with testing and stuff...
[2015/11/19 10:43:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: By the way: Feature freeze already passed, right?
[2015/11/19 10:43:18] <Tobbi> When is string freeze?
[2015/11/19 10:44:07] <head8debian> Tobbi: String freeze?
[2015/11/19 10:44:25] <Tobbi> head8debian: You know, when you snatch a girl's underpants and put it in the fridge.
[2015/11/19 10:44:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: We are only a month from release... so we should not be incorperating really anything...
[2015/11/19 10:44:38] <head8debian> except bug fixes.
[2015/11/19 10:44:38] <Tobbi> Or rather freezer
[2015/11/19 10:44:44] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/19 10:44:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: String freeze is when the strings = all text is frozen.
[2015/11/19 10:45:05] <Tobbi> So that translators don't have to incorporate changes...
[2015/11/19 10:45:19] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/11/19 10:45:20] <Tobbi> But since we don't know where giby is...we shouldn't really be doing anything.
[2015/11/19 10:45:43] <Tobbi> head8debian: does makepot.sh work for you?
[2015/11/19 10:45:52] <Tobbi> From a non-Mac / non-Windows computer..
[2015/11/19 10:49:50] <maths22> Tobbi: I think my build changes should probably get integrated before release

[2015/11/19 10:50:03] <Tobbi> maths22: sure, thanks.
[2015/11/19 10:50:49] <Tobbi> head8debian: couldn't you postpone the logo issue? I am not sure whether we should change our logo at all, but who knows...
[2015/11/19 10:51:01] <Tobbi> maths22: Please do a pull request when you're ready.
[2015/11/19 10:51:07] <Tobbi> maths22: Also, what about the changes to the squirrel lib?
[2015/11/19 10:51:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: Anyone can re-open it if they want...
[2015/11/19 10:51:14] <Tobbi> Right!
[2015/11/19 10:51:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't like having stuff floating in my hair.
[2015/11/19 10:51:24] <maths22> Tobbi: What am I doing with squirrel?
[2015/11/19 10:51:25] <head8debian> ;)
[2015/11/19 10:51:41] <Tobbi> maths22: https://github.com/SuperTux/squirrel/pull/1 ?
[2015/11/19 10:51:46] <head8debian> Tobbi: makepot.sh?
[2015/11/19 10:52:06] <Tobbi> maths22: Also https://github.com/SuperTux/tinygettext/pull/1
[2015/11/19 10:52:17] <Tobbi> To be honest, I don't know anything about this...
[2015/11/19 10:52:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: makepot.sh should create localizations...
[2015/11/19 10:52:36] <maths22> Tobbi: I see what you are talking about
[2015/11/19 10:52:44] <maths22> I'm going to close those and open a new set
[2015/11/19 10:52:52] <Tobbi> okay, sounds good.
[2015/11/19 10:53:00] <maths22> It's just little changes mostly to make Windows happy
[2015/11/19 10:53:03] <Tobbi> As I said, I am not too familiar with CMake...
[2015/11/19 10:53:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, it doesn't have any rm -rf commands... and it finished properly... :-)
[2015/11/19 10:53:41] <head8debian> Not sure what it did...
[2015/11/19 10:53:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, so, because it didn't work on my mac.
[2015/11/19 10:53:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: Does git diff show you anything?

[2015/11/19 10:55:33] <Tobbi> Okay....
[2015/11/19 10:55:49] <Tobbi> not what I expected, anyway.
[2015/11/19 10:56:12] <head8debian> Does anything ever come out the way we expect? :p
[2015/11/19 10:56:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: Not with this project, no.
[2015/11/19 10:57:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't think its just us...
[2015/11/19 10:58:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Now, if you copy one of the add-on levelsets (the actual directory, not the zip) to data/levels, then run that command again?
[2015/11/19 11:04:02] <Tobbi> Aha!
[2015/11/19 11:04:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: I fixed it!
[2015/11/19 11:04:45] <Tobbi> It uses strange line endings that were converted.
[2015/11/19 11:09:48] <Tobbi> Oh, it created a pot file.
[2015/11/19 11:09:53] <Tobbi> Not sure what that does.
[2015/11/19 11:09:53] <maths22> Tobbi: Windows and OS X are up to date here: http://brlcad.org/~maths22/supertux-download.php
[2015/11/19 11:10:08] <maths22> Linux is building and will be up to date at some point
[2015/11/19 11:10:22] <Tobbi> maths22: Except that "The requested URL /usr/web/brlcad.org/builds/SUPERTUX-0.4.0-GIT-Darwin.dmg was not found on this server." ;)
[2015/11/19 11:10:52] <maths22> Tobbi: fixing...
[2015/11/19 11:10:57] <Tobbi> :-)
[2015/11/19 11:12:15] <Tobbi> I should actually change the URL in the topic.
[2015/11/19 11:12:29] @ Tobbi set topic "Welcome to the SuperTux chat | https://github.com/SuperTux | Stable: 0.1.3 | Beta: 0.3.5a | Travis: https://travis-ci.org/SuperTux/supertux | mailing list: supertux-devel@lists.lethargik.org | Â©hÃ¤Ã±Ã±Ã¨Å ÅÃ´Ç¥ http://sydneyjd.github.io/logs/ | nightly builds http://brlcad.org/~maths22/supertux-download.php"

[2015/11/19 11:13:59] <Tobbi> Thanks, looks good.
[2015/11/19 11:14:26] <Tobbi> maths22: Would it be possible for you to display the commit hash of the file and the build date on that site?
[2015/11/19 11:14:40] <Tobbi> eeh, by commit hash I mean the HEAD commit SHA...
[2015/11/19 11:15:23] <maths22> Tobbi: That will be added
[2015/11/19 11:15:34] <Tobbi> Great.
[2015/11/19 11:15:48] <maths22> Tobbi: Is it OK if I change cmake version numbers to use git describe?
[2015/11/19 11:15:49] <Tobbi> maths22: By the way: Shall I add you to the credits before the release?
[2015/11/19 11:15:54] <Tobbi> maths22: Yes, sure.
[2015/11/19 11:16:10] <maths22> Tobbi: Sure on the credits
[2015/11/19 11:16:20] <maths22> Do you have my real name?
[2015/11/19 11:16:36] <Tobbi> maths22: I don't. Actually you can submit a PR for credits.txt and I will merge that :)

[2015/11/19 11:33:19] <brmbrmcar> Why is it 'nightly'?
[2015/11/19 11:33:52] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: It builds supertux every night or pretty close to that.
[2015/11/19 11:34:18] <brmbrmcar> So, what about my error when trying to install a nightly build?
[2015/11/19 11:36:42] <Tobbi> maths22: There's something weird going on: The nightly build for Mac crashes (for some reason). Also the executable is only 276 bytes in size.
[2015/11/19 11:36:51] <Tobbi> So, there might have been a problem with loading the file
[2015/11/19 11:37:24] <brmbrmcar> All the nightly builds are throwing up errors.
[2015/11/19 11:38:05] <Tobbi> Maybe not all of them.
[2015/11/19 11:38:23] <brmbrmcar> Well, everything I've tried.
[2015/11/19 11:38:40] <brmbrmcar> Wine, maybe? I'll test it.
[2015/11/19 11:39:44] <head8debian> I will give the windows one a try later.
[2015/11/19 11:41:25] <brmbrmcar> In the Windows build, not executable file is generated.
[2015/11/19 11:41:41] <brmbrmcar> Youjust get the uninstall.exe
[2015/11/19 11:42:18] <brmbrmcar> The package is so crazy!
[2015/11/19 11:42:57] <maths22> Clearly something failed.
[2015/11/19 11:42:59] <maths22> I will fix that
[2015/11/19 11:43:37] <Tobbi> But this release will be great.
[2015/11/19 11:43:39] <Tobbi> :)
[2015/11/19 11:43:46] <head8debian> Yes it will. :-)
[2015/11/19 11:43:47] <brmbrmcar> December 20?
[2015/11/19 11:44:02] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: We have no dates set currently...
[2015/11/19 11:44:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: What day does the christmas code kick in again?
[2015/11/19 11:44:33] <brmbrmcar> 6th
[2015/11/19 11:44:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: Gosh, I don't know. Calculate it. :D
[2015/11/19 11:45:08] <Tobbi> Yes, the 6th
[2015/11/19 11:45:16] <brmbrmcar> Yay!
[2015/11/19 11:45:21] <Tobbi> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/68bdf113c9cf702f206d3ce078a4c09340bb8ce1/src/supertux/gameconfig.hpp
[2015/11/19 11:46:39] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Were you able to get a screenshot for https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/227 ?
[2015/11/19 11:47:05] <brmbrmcar> Hang on...
[2015/11/19 11:48:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: Could we release on maybe the 10th?
[2015/11/19 11:48:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: I guess whenever we feel like it. :-)
[2015/11/19 11:48:45] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: It is very hard to capture, as it is only there for a very small amount of time.
[2015/11/19 11:50:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, this should be set in advance.
[2015/11/19 11:51:03] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So you're saying that the game freezes loading the game assets etc.?
[2015/11/19 11:51:07] <Tobbi> But works afterwards?
[2015/11/19 11:51:29] <brmbrmcar> Ah, for that.
[2015/11/19 11:52:13] <brmbrmcar> It shows afterwards, but the screen updates around every 5 seconds
[2015/11/19 11:52:21] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/19 11:52:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: Good idea... Sometime in december...
[2015/11/19 11:52:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: That was irony, wasn't it?
[2015/11/19 11:53:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: I believe the 10th is a bit too early...didn't we set for the 20th?
[2015/11/19 11:53:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: I belive we did.
[2015/11/19 11:53:30] <Tobbi> That's a sunday, so should work fine.
[2015/11/19 11:53:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its a decent time. ;) Right before Christmas. :-)
[2015/11/19 11:53:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: Definitely.
[2015/11/19 11:53:55] <brmbrmcar> Why does the day of the week matter?
[2015/11/19 11:54:06] <Tobbi> Also 0.3.0 or something was released on the 20th as well.
[2015/11/19 11:54:12] <head8debian> Deck the website with boughs of holly, lalalalala lalalala. :p
[2015/11/19 11:54:14] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Because release dates tend to be tressful.
[2015/11/19 11:54:24] <head8debian> haha.
[2015/11/19 11:54:26] <head8debian> True.
[2015/11/19 11:54:27] <Tobbi> *stressful
[2015/11/19 11:54:44] <brmbrmcar> You like Sunday stress!
[2015/11/19 11:54:52] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I have college during the weekdays...
[2015/11/19 11:55:18] <head8debian> I have school.
[2015/11/19 11:55:40] <Tobbi> We should *actually* see if we can fetch available langpacks for people on startup.
[2015/11/19 11:55:54] <Tobbi> and / or when switching languages.
[2015/11/19 11:56:05] <Tobbi> That should be done before the release.
[2015/11/19 11:56:08] <Tobbi> LMH told me about it.
[2015/11/19 11:57:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok. Well, just so long as everything is "still" stable.
[2015/11/19 11:58:03] <head8debian> Im shocked that we are so close to release...
[2015/11/19 11:58:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: Maybe I won't do it.
[2015/11/19 11:58:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: Sure, but the release date was planned way in advance, right?
[2015/11/19 11:58:28] <Tobbi> didn't we?
[2015/11/19 11:58:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes.
[2015/11/19 11:59:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its just coming up so fast.
[2015/11/19 11:59:18] <Tobbi> Right...
[2015/11/19 11:59:33] <Tobbi> head8debian: But this release is great... Lots of stuff added and finished etc.
[2015/11/19 12:00:20] <brmbrmcar> Nice and stable. No Windows or OSX computers will blow up because of us.
[2015/11/19 12:00:29] <Tobbi> Yes, and that.
[2015/11/19 12:00:33] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/11/19 12:03:07] <brmbrmcar> Supertux will be released in 31 days.
[2015/11/19 12:03:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: http://lwn.net/Articles/250967/ :D
[2015/11/19 12:03:22] <head8debian> Perfect article for you. :D
[2015/11/19 12:03:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: Not right now.
[2015/11/19 12:03:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am a little concerned whether giby will show up...Because he hasn't...
[2015/11/19 12:04:05] <Tobbi> We need up-to-date localizations.
[2015/11/19 12:04:23] <brmbrmcar> head8debian:Why is Tux wearing glasses?
[2015/11/19 12:04:41] <brmbrmcar> They are blue!
[2015/11/19 12:05:32] <head8debian> ~seen giby
[2015/11/19 12:05:32] <red_bot> head8debian: giby was last seen 12 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 33 seconds ago, quitting IRC (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[2015/11/19 12:05:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: :-/
[2015/11/19 12:05:51] <Tobbi> Yes, precisely...
[2015/11/19 12:06:55] <brmbrmcar> \-:
[2015/11/19 12:07:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, he has one month to appear... If not... :-/
[2015/11/19 12:07:14] <brmbrmcar> And what are the odds?
[2015/11/19 12:07:17] <Tobbi> head8debian: He needs to update translations, and the translators need to translate those.
[2015/11/19 12:07:21] <Tobbi> There are strings...
[2015/11/19 12:07:32] <Tobbi> That are not on transifex yet, I mean.
[2015/11/19 12:08:35] <Tobbi> And I don't have the know-how...
[2015/11/19 12:09:06] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Uhm, 10:1 that he *will* show up.
[2015/11/19 12:09:15] <head8debian> he will show up...
[2015/11/19 12:09:21] <brmbrmcar> I don't gamble.
[2015/11/19 12:09:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: But what if he doesn't appear before the release?
[2015/11/19 12:09:40] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: neither do i.
[2015/11/19 12:09:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: Then we will ship with untranslated strings.
[2015/11/19 12:09:51] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's not a big deal...
[2015/11/19 12:10:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Oh. Well you made it sound like a big deal. :-)
[2015/11/19 12:10:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: Hmm, it would just be great, if...
[2015/11/19 12:10:39] <Tobbi> well, never mind.
[2015/11/19 12:10:56] <brmbrmcar> So an incomplete 0.4.0.
[2015/11/19 12:11:46] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes... i understand.

[2015/11/19 12:27:52] <Tobbi> yes, don't know the filename, though.
[2015/11/19 12:28:16] <Hume2> It's in Bonus Island 3, isn't it?
[2015/11/19 12:28:48] <Tobbi> Hume2: Not that I know of, I believe it's in CT. dabomb's level sets.
[2015/11/19 12:29:36] <brmbrmcar> Console isn't giving any clues to the filename.
[2015/11/19 12:30:05] <brmbrmcar> for-haul.st;
[2015/11/19 12:30:12] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/19 12:30:14] <Tobbi> Exactly.
[2015/11/19 12:30:15] <Tobbi> for-haul.stl
[2015/11/19 12:31:10] <brmbrmcar> Have the deliberately covered the level with white?
[2015/11/19 12:32:39] <Tobbi> covered the level with white?
[2015/11/19 12:32:48] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/19 12:33:01] <brmbrmcar> You can't erase the stuff onthe second sector.
[2015/11/19 12:33:24] <Tobbi> Aha.
[2015/11/19 12:33:25] <Tobbi> Not sure.
[2015/11/19 12:33:55] <brmbrmcar> Why would they do it though?
[2015/11/19 12:33:59] <Hume2> Well, in my opinion, the icecrusher are wrongly placed, because one of them is in a wall.

[2015/11/19 12:37:42] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yes, that's true.
[2015/11/19 12:37:50] <Tobbi> Not sure if it's worth fixing, then.
[2015/11/19 12:38:28] <Hume2> I've once fixed one icecrusher related bug, related to the same level.
[2015/11/19 12:38:42] <brmbrmcar> Oh yes.
[2015/11/19 12:38:44] <Hume2> So choose which bug do you like more.
[2015/11/19 12:38:58] <Tobbi> Yes, it's fine the way it is.
[2015/11/19 12:39:05] @ Quit: Karkus: Client Quit
[2015/11/19 12:39:45] <brmbrmcar> If you get an icecrusher to crush you upwards, you can jump up the wall.
[2015/11/19 12:41:06] <Hume2> It worked before, but I fixed that bug I hope.
[2015/11/19 12:41:13] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/19 12:41:23] <brmbrmcar> Have you tried it?
[2015/11/19 12:42:10] <Hume2> Previously it worked with any platform moving up and a wall that is 32px high.
[2015/11/19 12:42:17] <maths22> Tobbi: By the way, the linux builds appear to work correctly, so the issue is limited to the OS X and Windows builds
[2015/11/19 12:42:27] <Tobbi> Okay?
[2015/11/19 12:42:39] <Tobbi> That's weird.
[2015/11/19 12:42:46] <brmbrmcar> Ihad a bug with the Ubuntu one earlier today.
[2015/11/19 12:42:58] <brmbrmcar> It couldn't get the public key.
[2015/11/19 12:44:16] <brmbrmcar> And all the Windows build does is unpackage itself.
[2015/11/19 12:44:25] <brmbrmcar> And create uninstall.exe!
[2015/11/19 12:45:05] <Tobbi> We should assemble a list of things to do for the release.
[2015/11/19 12:45:16] <Tobbi> I mean: Update website, update wiki etc.
[2015/11/19 12:45:27] <brmbrmcar> Create working builds

[2015/11/19 12:47:30] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/19 12:48:52] <brmbrmcar> How long will it take for the packages to be in the repos then?
[2015/11/19 12:49:09] <maths22> brmbrmcar: Actually, the windows build mostly works, but it may not do working shortcuts
[2015/11/19 12:49:16] <maths22> It also is missing 2 dlls
[2015/11/19 12:49:37] <brmbrmcar> maths22: I see no supertux.exe or anything similar in there.
[2015/11/19 12:49:39] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I will test Ubuntu later today
[2015/11/19 12:49:43] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It is in the bin directory
[2015/11/19 12:50:24] <brmbrmcar> It won't start up.
[2015/11/19 12:50:26] <maths22> Also, what issue did you have with the key
[2015/11/19 12:50:27] <Hume2> Should be Tux able to unduck in tiny passages and then get hurt?
[2015/11/19 12:50:31] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I know it won't start
[2015/11/19 12:50:35] <maths22> I'm fixing that later today
[2015/11/19 12:50:41] <brmbrmcar> To be fair,I am using Wine.
[2015/11/19 12:50:50] <maths22> brmbrmcar: So am I, actually
[2015/11/19 12:50:54] <maths22> I should test on real windows
[2015/11/19 12:51:12] <Hume2> Windows is a virus.
[2015/11/19 12:51:14] <maths22> (I have real windows, but that means I have to restart my computer)
[2015/11/19 12:52:21] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It is missing LIBEAY32.dll and SSLEAY32.dll
[2015/11/19 12:52:29] <maths22> I will take care of them
[2015/11/19 12:52:33] <brmbrmcar> maths22: OK, thanks.
[2015/11/19 12:52:56] <maths22> Tobbi: what is specifically broken in the OS X build?
[2015/11/19 12:53:52] <Tobbi> maths22: The executable isn't built correctly, afaict.
[2015/11/19 12:54:15] <Tobbi> Hume2: Unducking and getting hurt is intended behaviour.
[2015/11/19 12:55:08] <Hume2> It's not much real, but well then.
[2015/11/19 12:55:50] <Tobbi> maths22: So, on my system, supertux2 has a size of 6.8 MB
[2015/11/19 12:55:58] <brmbrmcar> Tux should be sent back out the way bhe came!
[2015/11/19 12:56:27] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: This was removed because of the glitch it caused.
[2015/11/19 12:56:28] <maths22> Tobbi: I'll take a look this afternoon (when I get access to a Mac)
[2015/11/19 12:57:06] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: I'd like to see a way of walking when ducked, but that's for Milestone 3.
[2015/11/19 12:57:14] <Tobbi> Sure, thanks.
[2015/11/19 12:57:41] <brmbrmcar> Hume2: It was like that in 0.1.3
[2015/11/19 12:58:01] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: Yes. Do you know that glitch?
[2015/11/19 13:00:31] <Hume2> About 10% of TeraTux levels were based on that glitch.

[2015/11/19 14:31:51] @ onpon4 joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/19 14:33:21] <onpon4> Just want to point this out, in case anyone working on SuperTux's graphics is interested: http://opengameart.org/forumtopic/retux-graphical-improvements
[2015/11/19 14:34:04] <Karkus> onpon4: Did you use any code from SuperTux?
[2015/11/19 14:34:14] <onpon4> Karkus: No.
[2015/11/19 14:34:34] <Karkus> onpon4: What about graphics?
[2015/11/19 14:34:43] <onpon4> I've mentioned ReTux before; it's a different game, but using SuperTux's graphics, sounds, and music.
[2015/11/19 14:35:14] <onpon4> Actually, there are a couple graphics and a couple sounds added from other sources too, but it's basically using SuperTux's art assets.
[2015/11/19 14:35:45] <onpon4> Anyway, those improvements I'm looking for would benefit SuperTux just as much as ReTux. :)
[2015/11/19 14:36:08] <onpon4> Or, at least, some of them would. Not sure about the last three.
[2015/11/19 14:36:14] <brmbrmcar> Is reTux even legal? It could be classed as commercial,as it in theory costs money.
[2015/11/19 14:36:17] <Karkus> Oh, okay. Have you checked all the licenses and that out to make sure you aren't doing anything wrong? In the end, those assets aren't yours.
[2015/11/19 14:36:35] <onpon4> brmbrmcar: Yes, it's commercial. The GNU GPL allows commercial use.
[2015/11/19 14:36:38] <Karkus> brmrbrmcar: It depends on the assets
[2015/11/19 14:37:11] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/19 14:37:18] <Karkus> onpon4: I don't think the graphics are under GPL. I might be wrong
[2015/11/19 14:37:26] <maths22> I have tried to work this through before, but basically the GPL is not very relevant to graphics/data assets
[2015/11/19 14:37:39] <maths22> This is why we use a CC-BY-SA license
[2015/11/19 14:37:48] <onpon4> That they're under the GNU GPL is the consensus I got when I asked previously.
[2015/11/19 14:37:50] <Karkus> maths22: Thought so
[2015/11/19 14:37:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats that mean? o_O
[2015/11/19 14:38:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: Unit test = tests for a couple of functions.
[2015/11/19 14:38:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well, i *could* work on the filenames for the forest world if i knew how.
[2015/11/19 14:38:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Just rename the files and update worldmap.stwm
[2015/11/19 14:38:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: Oh. So they match in-game?
[2015/11/19 14:38:51] <Karkus> onpon4: Well it seems they aren't
[2015/11/19 14:38:53] <head8debian> in-game filenames*
[2015/11/19 14:38:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh? We are only talking about the filenames...
[2015/11/19 14:39:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: What do you mean by that_
[2015/11/19 14:39:08] <onpon4> Also here: http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=68&t=6631&sid=d4a94fecbf89f594e6e4128d8fd11227#p66510
[2015/11/19 14:39:08] <Tobbi> By "in game filenames"?
[2015/11/19 14:39:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: Do i need to rename the actual physical filename of the game file, or what the name of the level appears to be in the game?
[2015/11/19 14:39:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: What license are the assets under?
[2015/11/19 14:40:00] <head8debian> I don't know how to put it simpler than that.
[2015/11/19 14:40:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: Rename the .stl file and change the reference in the stwm file.
[2015/11/19 14:40:25] <Tobbi> makes sense?
[2015/11/19 14:40:34] <onpon4> But if it's true that SuperTux's graphics are not under the GNU GPL, then they are *proprietary*, because no file indicates any other license. And that would make SuperTux unfit for inclusion in Debian, meaning you have to replace *all* the graphics.
[2015/11/19 14:40:49] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's a good question... I'd say they are under the GPL...
[2015/11/19 14:40:50] <onpon4> I don't think that's the case.
[2015/11/19 14:41:02] <Tobbi> I don't have other information, but let me look.
[2015/11/19 14:41:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes.
[2015/11/19 14:41:51] <Karkus> onpon4: Proprietary != not GPL though
[2015/11/19 14:42:47] <Karkus> onpon4: I thought proprietary was a code term anyway
[2015/11/19 14:42:56] <onpon4> Karkus: If no license is specified, proprietary is the default. The only possible license I see that can apply to SuperTux's graphics is the GNU GPL, and it looks to me like that was the intention of the artists.
[2015/11/19 14:43:14] <onpon4> Karkus: Culture can be libre or proprietary, too.
[2015/11/19 14:43:46] <Karkus> Hmm I guess it can
[2015/11/19 14:43:57] <Tobbi> Karkus: Only thing I can find is https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/data/AUTHORS
[2015/11/19 14:44:48] <maths22> onpon4: They are some combination of GPL and CC-BY-SA

[2015/11/19 14:51:31] <maths22> Unfourtniately, nothing actually says that for the graphics assets
[2015/11/19 14:51:50] <maths22> Therefore, they are technically only GPL (unless I find an old LICENSE file)
[2015/11/19 14:52:46] <brmbrmcar> So...
[2015/11/19 14:53:08] <Karkus> onpon4: What license is ReTux under?
[2015/11/19 14:53:17] <maths22> The real issue is just that the GPL applies rather poorly to assets
[2015/11/19 14:53:22] <onpon4> Karkus: The code is under the GNU GPL.
[2015/11/19 14:53:48] <onpon4> As are all the rest of the things I made from scratch (like levels).
[2015/11/19 14:53:52] <brmbrmcar> How does that work?
[2015/11/19 14:53:59] <Karkus> onpon4: So if a person bought the game, you'd show them the code?
[2015/11/19 14:54:19] <onpon4> Karkus: Of course. The backers already have the source code. One of them has even published it.
[2015/11/19 14:54:48] <Tobbi> onpon4: But that means the code can actually live on github, for example, can't it?
[2015/11/19 14:54:58] <onpon4> Tobbi: If someone else puts it there, sure.
[2015/11/19 14:55:13] <Tobbi> onpon4: Why not put it there yourself?

[2015/11/19 14:57:29] <onpon4> Eh, I guess I could give you a gratis copy, too.
[2015/11/19 14:58:05] <onpon4> Actually, on that note, I gave a gratis copy of ReTux to the woman who did the run animation. Probably will do the same for anyone who does any of those improvements.
[2015/11/19 14:58:36] <Tobbi> Actually, that run animation should get integrated.
[2015/11/19 14:58:43] <Tobbi> Not sure if we can make it before the release, probably not.
[2015/11/19 14:58:50] <Tobbi> But for after 0.4, this might be great.
[2015/11/19 14:58:58] <Karkus> onpon4: We have our own project, if you haven't noticed -_-
[2015/11/19 15:00:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have been thinking: Maybe we can get this guy here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOeP9tztDl0 to update his level set for MS 2.
[2015/11/19 15:01:39] <Tobbi> Plus, he's available an replies to requests, see the top comment.
[2015/11/19 15:03:34] <Karkus> Tobbi: So we could maybe convince him to join us on GitHub?
[2015/11/19 15:04:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yup. I believe, he'd need to adjust the license of the add-on as well, and let's hope he doesn't have any non-free assets in there.
[2015/11/19 15:04:10] <Tobbi> Otherwise, same problem we already had.
[2015/11/19 15:04:16] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in music???
[2015/11/19 15:04:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: Precisely...or background images...
[2015/11/19 15:04:31] <Karkus> Lots of non-free assets where that's concerned
[2015/11/19 15:04:32] <Tobbi> He's using custom background images.
[2015/11/19 15:04:57] <grumbel> shouldn't be to hard to repaint them if needed
[2015/11/19 15:05:33] <Karkus> Tobbi: The worldmap music is non-free, maybe others
[2015/11/19 15:05:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: How do you know?
[2015/11/19 15:05:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: I recognise it
[2015/11/19 15:05:55] <Tobbi> grumbel: For example that picture of the beach with palm tree?
[2015/11/19 15:06:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: I see...so maybe not such a good idea...But doesn't hurt to try.
[2015/11/19 15:06:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: It's not hard to change.
[2015/11/19 15:06:24] <Tobbi> Right
[2015/11/19 15:19:06] @ Quit: grumbel: Quit: Ex-Chat
[2015/11/19 15:20:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: I
[2015/11/19 15:20:09] <Tobbi> ve been thinking.
[2015/11/19 15:20:12] <Tobbi> Sorry.
[2015/11/19 15:20:13] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 15:20:16] <Karkus> :P
[2015/11/19 15:20:29] <Karkus> Tobbi: That's a first then
[2015/11/19 15:20:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: So, I believe if we pass a directory to ./supertux2 instead of a level or worldmap file, it should create a level set out of the levels in that directory.
[2015/11/19 15:20:41] <Tobbi> At least IMO
[2015/11/19 15:20:54] <Tobbi> And display a listing, I mean.
[2015/11/19 15:21:04] <Karkus> Oh, okay
[2015/11/19 15:21:12] <Tobbi> Not sure how hard that would be.
[2015/11/19 15:21:23] <Karkus> Shouldn't be toooooo hard
[2015/11/19 15:21:28] <Karkus> Tobbi: I
[2015/11/19 15:21:31] <Karkus> ve been thinking
[2015/11/19 15:21:31] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 15:21:36] <Karkus> :D
[2015/11/19 15:21:39] <Karkus> too
[2015/11/19 15:21:40] <Tobbi> damn. stop.
[2015/11/19 15:22:25] <Karkus> I've been thinking about Tinygettext thing
[2015/11/19 15:22:32] <Tobbi> Ah.
[2015/11/19 15:22:35] <Tobbi> And?
[2015/11/19 15:22:49] <Karkus> Just a moment
[2015/11/19 15:26:23] <Karkus> When disabled, we just need to set it to disabled and then stop Tinygettext checking there. So we don't necessarily need to unload it. Does that make sense or am I wrong?
[2015/11/19 15:26:39] <Tobbi> Karkus: The thing is: The strings get added to a global dictionary...
[2015/11/19 15:26:39] <Karkus> Tobbi: I know
[2015/11/19 15:26:54] <Tobbi> Karkus: Problem is letting the GUI reload the strings...aka calling _("my string") on the strings again.
[2015/11/19 15:28:07] <Karkus> Tobbi: But, unlike the language menu, we don't want to reset to Main Menu
[2015/11/19 15:28:09] <Karkus> I see.
[2015/11/19 15:28:31] <Tobbi> Karkus: Even if we reset to MainMenu, it still doesn't work properly. I tried that, I believe.
[2015/11/19 15:28:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: Did you work out why?
[2015/11/19 15:29:03] <Karkus> I would expect it to work
[2015/11/19 15:29:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: Nope, sorry.
[2015/11/19 15:29:12] <Tobbi> Karkus: You can try it, if you want.
[2015/11/19 15:29:23] <Karkus> Okay, I will try
[2015/11/19 15:31:47] <Karkus> Tobbi: I see you squished the language pack menu in with the addon menu :)
[2015/11/19 15:32:00] <Tobbi> Karkus: yup, LMH also provided something...
[2015/11/19 15:32:22] <Tobbi> Karkus: Problem is that langpacks have to be installed separately, so if people don't get that they have to install them, they'll get untranslated strings.
[2015/11/19 15:32:32] <Tobbi> But I can live with that for now.
[2015/11/19 15:33:43] <Karkus> Tobbi: Was there a reason they had to be separate rather than downloaded with the addons?
[2015/11/19 15:34:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: Behind the scenes, they are add-ons. What I mean is: When switching languages, they are not installed automatically.
[2015/11/19 15:34:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: All languages are addons?
[2015/11/19 15:34:55] <Tobbi> Karkus: Only strings for contrib levels are in add-ons.
[2015/11/19 15:35:00] <Tobbi> Does that make sense?
[2015/11/19 15:35:04] <Karkus> Yes
[2015/11/19 15:35:39] <Karkus> So, why not look within the addon .zip file for other (language pack) addons, and install them alongside?
[2015/11/19 15:35:50] <Karkus> Therefore, no disabling at all
[2015/11/19 15:36:42] <Karkus> Tobbi: ?^
[2015/11/19 15:37:08] <Tobbi> Uhm?
[2015/11/19 15:37:25] <Karkus> You don't understand?
[2015/11/19 15:37:27] <Tobbi> Nope.
[2015/11/19 15:38:49] <Karkus> Okay, let's say I made a world map, and package it into a .zip called kark.zip. I upload it to the supertux addons repo. Then, I add some German translations to the kark.zip. The game would automatically load this when people installed the addons
[2015/11/19 15:39:14] <Karkus> s/the addons/the kark.zip addon/
[2015/11/19 15:39:14] <red_bot> Karkus meant: "Okay, let's say I made a world map, and package it into a .zip called kark.zip. I upload it to the supertux addons repo. Then, I add some German translations to the kark.zip. The game would automatically load this when people installed the kark.zip addon"
[2015/11/19 15:40:39] <Karkus> The game would fetch translations, if possible, from kark.zip *during install of that addon*
[2015/11/19 15:41:23] <Karkus> Tobbi: Understand now?
[2015/11/19 15:41:24] <Tobbi> Karkus: That's true.
[2015/11/19 15:41:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: And it's possible as well...
[2015/11/19 15:41:36] <Tobbi> But updating is a pain...
[2015/11/19 15:41:47] <Tobbi> Basically you'd update the zip file whenever translations change.
[2015/11/19 15:42:03] <Karkus> Tobbi: You'd update the lang pack anyway
[2015/11/19 15:42:09] <Tobbi> I know...
[2015/11/19 15:42:17] <Tobbi> Karkus: But, LMH requested it that way...
[2015/11/19 15:42:22] <Tobbi> To have langpacks...
[2015/11/19 15:42:25] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hmm.
[2015/11/19 15:44:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: Since there's a disagreement, for 0.4.0 we'll leave it how it is. Now let me try resetting to main menu...
[2015/11/19 15:44:23] <Tobbi> Sure.
[2015/11/19 15:45:05] <Tobbi> Karkus: I mean: Both is possible. Localizations can be included in the addon's zip file or in a specific langpack add-on...
[2015/11/19 15:45:12] <Tobbi> Just a matter of what we actually do.
[2015/11/19 15:45:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: Oh. I didn't know that already worked...
[2015/11/19 15:46:02] <Tobbi> I think I fixed that a while ago.
[2015/11/19 15:46:04] <Tobbi> let me check

[2015/11/19 15:54:55] @ tux|dude joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/19 15:55:22] <Karkus> Tobbi: Currently, are the translations being removed when the addon is disabled? Or just not loaded on startup?
[2015/11/19 15:56:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: If an add-on is disabled, the cache gets invalidated which triggers tinygettext to fetch the latest translation upon calling _("some string")
[2015/11/19 15:56:41] <Tobbi> I *believe* the problem is that this never happens, though...that _() is called again.
[2015/11/19 15:57:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: So, something to do with Tinygettext?
[2015/11/19 15:57:02] <Tobbi> "_" is the name of the translation function.
[2015/11/19 15:57:20] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am not sure...possibly something to do with how we load strings.
[2015/11/19 15:57:21] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah, I've seen this before
[2015/11/19 15:58:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: How does invalidating the cache work?

[2015/11/19 16:02:51] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, but only once, right? I mean: only after loading a screen...
[2015/11/19 16:03:00] <Karkus> Hmmm...
[2015/11/19 16:03:05] <Karkus> Loading which screen
[2015/11/19 16:03:37] <Karkus> I've been testing with the level names of the Halloween levels.

[2015/11/19 16:04:50] <Tobbi> I am not sure when its _() gets called.
[2015/11/19 16:05:20] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, so the level names work fine?
[2015/11/19 16:05:37] <Tobbi> Karkus: Most of the time...
[2015/11/19 16:05:38] <Tobbi> Let me check.
[2015/11/19 16:05:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: Why would the addon name change???
[2015/11/19 16:06:03] * Karkus is more confused
[2015/11/19 16:06:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: Actually, the level names don't work fine, either.
[2015/11/19 16:06:26] <Tobbi> I just disabled the langpack, and it still shows in german.
[2015/11/19 16:06:32] <Tobbi> Karkus: The add-on label, rather...
[2015/11/19 16:06:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: Yeah...
[2015/11/19 16:06:38] <Tobbi> Which gets displayed in the contrib levels...
[2015/11/19 16:06:43] <Tobbi> Sorry...
[2015/11/19 16:06:56] <Tobbi> It's quite confusing everything :P
[2015/11/19 16:07:01] <Karkus> Tobbi: Agreed
[2015/11/19 16:07:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay, I understand that problem with the label
[2015/11/19 16:08:02] <Tobbi> oh?
[2015/11/19 16:08:30] <Tobbi> Ah, understand probably != know how to fix it...
[2015/11/19 16:08:31] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/19 16:08:36] <Karkus> Yeah...
[2015/11/19 16:09:01] <Karkus> I meant I know what you meant
[2015/11/19 16:09:18] <Tobbi> okay...
[2015/11/19 16:09:43] <Tobbi> I have a feeling this will require a major architecture change.
[2015/11/19 16:09:56] <Tobbi> Because we can't get the labels to update unless we reload their strings.

[2015/11/19 16:11:20] <brmbrmcar> He wants money.

[2015/11/19 16:23:44] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am not sure whether it's just a coincidence, but I e-mailed numberphile and suggested they do Million Dollar Problems :P
[2015/11/19 16:23:50] <Tobbi> some 3 weeks before they released it.
[2015/11/19 16:23:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: And that's the video that taught me. Now to learn it again
[2015/11/19 16:23:58] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/19 16:25:04] <Karkus> Tobbi: Did you know the two people who've managed to win the million pounds both turned it down?
[2015/11/19 16:25:28] <Tobbi> Karkus: I know one of them...The guy who went to live in the rainforest(?)
[2015/11/19 16:25:33] <Tobbi> Let me check.
[2015/11/19 16:25:39] <Karkus> 'know'?
[2015/11/19 16:25:50] <Tobbi> Grigori Perelman
[2015/11/19 16:25:59] <Tobbi> Karkus: I mean: I knew the name.
[2015/11/19 16:26:03] <Tobbi> Or heard of that guy.
[2015/11/19 16:26:17] <Karkus> Tobbi: Okay
[2015/11/19 16:26:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: maybe it's only one that's been completed...
[2015/11/19 16:26:57] <Karkus> Let me check
[2015/11/19 16:26:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: Did you get anywhere with ducky levels?
[2015/11/19 16:27:03] <head8debian> ;p
[2015/11/19 16:27:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: ducky levels?
[2015/11/19 16:27:44] <Karkus> Tobbi: I was wrong. Only one has been done.
[2015/11/19 16:27:51] <Tobbi> Ah, okay...
[2015/11/19 16:29:01] <Tobbi> Karkus: I wished numberphile would explain more of the millennium problems...
[2015/11/19 16:29:13] <Tobbi> Maybe I should write them again.
[2015/11/19 16:29:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: Just in case the answer pops into your head?
[2015/11/19 16:29:23] <Tobbi> Actually, maybe the others are not that easily explainable...
[2015/11/19 16:29:28] <Karkus> Probably
[2015/11/19 16:29:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's interesting to think about that stuff.
[2015/11/19 16:29:34] <Karkus> and not maths related
[2015/11/19 16:29:40] <Karkus> very
[2015/11/19 16:29:42] <Karkus> idk
[2015/11/19 16:29:47] <Karkus> some are about physics
[2015/11/19 16:29:50] <Tobbi> oh...ok
[2015/11/19 16:30:15] <Karkus> P = NP for example, was probably explained on Computerphile
[2015/11/19 16:30:33] <head8debian> Tobbi: rubberduck...
[2015/11/19 16:30:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh, no, I didn't take a look at them...
[2015/11/19 16:31:13] <Tobbi> Wait, I did...
[2015/11/19 16:31:14] <Tobbi> long ago.
[2015/11/19 16:31:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: Screenshot, please?
[2015/11/19 16:31:55] <head8debian> Im busy...
[2015/11/19 16:32:36] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 16:34:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Where are the visable names for the levels in game chosen?
[2015/11/19 16:34:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: In the worldmap.stwm file, I believe.
[2015/11/19 16:34:43] <Tobbi> No, wait.
[2015/11/19 16:34:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: They are defined in the levels themselves.
[2015/11/19 16:35:00] <Tobbi> so in the stl file.
[2015/11/19 16:37:04] <head8debian> I see.

[2015/11/19 16:48:33] <Tobbi> I mean: The source strings.
[2015/11/19 16:50:10] <Tobbi> So, these are templates, most likely.

[2015/11/19 16:55:54] <Tobbi> I might have figured out how to use that.
[2015/11/19 16:57:19] <Tobbi> I'll have to create a new translation file, though.
[2015/11/19 16:59:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: It seems there are some more levels in /world2 than we are using...
[2015/11/19 16:59:23] <Tobbi> Yup...
[2015/11/19 16:59:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Should we?
[2015/11/19 17:00:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh? What?
[2015/11/19 17:00:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Should we add these odd levels to the worldmap?
[2015/11/19 17:01:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: Which ones are they?
[2015/11/19 17:03:18] <head8debian> castle, christophD,forest1-grumbel,Mtn Pass, village.
[2015/11/19 17:03:28] <head8debian> I think there is one more, but anyways.
[2015/11/19 17:04:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: There must be a reason they are left out though.
[2015/11/19 17:04:50] <head8debian> Im done renaming.
[2015/11/19 17:04:54] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/19 17:05:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Good, pull request please.
[2015/11/19 17:05:00] <head8debian> Now if someone would be willing to test.
[2015/11/19 17:10:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, so i have one additional file that i accedentally "git add"ed. How do i un-git-add it?
[2015/11/19 17:10:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: one moment, please.
[2015/11/19 17:15:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: o_O
[2015/11/19 17:15:38] <head8debian> I should have picked these files one by one if i knew it was going to take this long.
[2015/11/19 17:16:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ah! Got it.
[2015/11/19 17:18:19] <head8debian> Uh oh... where is my worldmap!?

[2015/11/19 18:18:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: urgh.
[2015/11/19 18:19:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: I feel the same way. ;)
[2015/11/19 18:19:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: On a related note: I set up automatic-pulling translations from the git repository from transifex.
[2015/11/19 18:19:50] <Tobbi> If it doesn't work, we're all screwed.
[2015/11/19 18:20:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Eww.
[2015/11/19 18:20:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: However, updating it from a file generated by makepot.sh *did* work, so updating from a URL should work as well.
[2015/11/19 18:21:11] <head8debian> Ok, well thats some hope then. :)
[2015/11/19 18:21:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: Unless I screwed up.
[2015/11/19 18:21:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: Lets hope not.
[2015/11/19 18:21:44] <Tobbi> yup.
[2015/11/19 18:26:47] <Tobbi> I never added the translations submodule to the main repo.
[2015/11/19 18:27:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: I cannot understand why my worldmap didn't get saved... I clicked the save butten multiple times.

[2015/11/19 19:37:51] <Tobbi> Didn't know you also know spanish.
[2015/11/19 19:38:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: I added a bunch of people to the translation teams. Let's hope they don't abuse their privilege.
[2015/11/19 19:38:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: I just don't know where to pick up. I don't remember all the old filenames.
[2015/11/19 19:38:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: huh? open the file with a text editor, so you know which level it is?
[2015/11/19 19:38:41] <Tobbi> It has it in the lisp file somewhere.
[2015/11/19 19:39:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: I renamed the .stl level files... and the worldmap didn't get updated. So i have the worldmap with the old file names and the files with new names...
[2015/11/19 19:39:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: I see!
[2015/11/19 19:40:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why did you do that? :D
[2015/11/19 19:40:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: You can check the repository, if you want.
[2015/11/19 19:40:22] <Tobbi> It should contain the old filenames together with the old levels...
[2015/11/19 19:40:24] <head8debian> Ah! That may help!
[2015/11/19 19:49:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uh oh... github is coming out with a new design they say.
[2015/11/19 19:50:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: Wasn't that what I just applied? The thing moved to the header?
[2015/11/19 19:50:33] <head8debian> Tobbi: I haven't applied it yet...
[2015/11/19 19:50:36] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 19:51:01] <Tobbi> head8debian: I believe we should add a script that allows us to package language add-on
[2015/11/19 19:51:01] <Tobbi> s
[2015/11/19 19:51:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Then do it. :-)
[2015/11/19 19:53:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: Not right now.
[2015/11/19 19:54:05] <Tobbi> I don't know how giby normally updates langpacks...
[2015/11/19 19:54:09] <Tobbi> or rather languages.

[2015/11/19 20:13:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Then git push?
[2015/11/19 20:13:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yup, you might need to force-push, though.
[2015/11/19 20:13:29] <head8debian> Done.
[2015/11/19 20:13:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: I hope all the levels work now. :D
[2015/11/19 20:14:11] <Tobbi> let's see...
[2015/11/19 20:15:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: Maybe we can put brm to work playing the whole forest world. :-)
[2015/11/19 20:15:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 20:15:45] <Tobbi> I'll quickly go through them, don't worry.
[2015/11/19 20:17:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: Looks good, except that it resets your stats now.
[2015/11/19 20:18:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: o_O
[2015/11/19 20:18:15] <head8debian> I go through them a sec also.
[2015/11/19 20:18:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, it's kind of expected that it resets your stats, since those stats depend on the level filename.
[2015/11/19 20:19:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, i won't go through them... ;)
[2015/11/19 20:19:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes.
[2015/11/19 20:19:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: Cannot really be helped.
[2015/11/19 20:19:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Nope, unless we keep the levels...
[2015/11/19 20:19:59] <Tobbi> the level filenames, I mean...
[2015/11/19 20:20:03] <head8debian> Meh.
[2015/11/19 20:20:09] <head8debian> :)
[2015/11/19 20:21:39] <Tobbi> But, we really achieved something...
[2015/11/19 20:21:44] <Tobbi> updating add-ons on transifex etc.
[2015/11/19 20:23:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: Is there anything else i can help with that is not graphics related atm?
[2015/11/19 20:23:19] <head8debian> Well, related to drawing graphiocs. ;-)
[2015/11/19 20:23:28] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 20:23:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: Yes, program a shell file that packages language packs.
[2015/11/19 20:23:42] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 20:23:49] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/19 20:24:05] <head8debian> I could try. Not sure i'd get anywhere.
[2015/11/19 20:24:18] <head8debian> Especially since i don't have a clue how our language packs work.
[2015/11/19 20:24:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: There are templates in the add-ons repository.
[2015/11/19 20:24:43] <Tobbi> check langpack-de
[2015/11/19 20:24:49] <Tobbi> or langpack-cz
[2015/11/19 20:25:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: But i don't speak de. :D
[2015/11/19 20:25:40] <Tobbi> head8debian: Doesn't matter. Just take a look at the file structure.
[2015/11/19 20:25:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ah.
[2015/11/19 20:26:07] <head8debian> I don't like the feel of a chicklet keyboard. Feels like i am going to break it by pushing the keys so hard. :p
[2015/11/19 20:27:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Anything else that needs to be done visually?
[2015/11/19 20:27:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Hmm...let me think.

[2015/11/19 20:30:03] <Tobbi> I don't know...
[2015/11/19 20:30:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: Only in SuperTux or in general?
[2015/11/19 20:30:11] <head8debian> Thats odd...

[2015/11/19 20:31:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sound is greyed out. :-/
[2015/11/19 20:31:35] <Tobbi> ah
[2015/11/19 20:31:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: Did we change something recently?
[2015/11/19 20:32:00] <Tobbi> no.

[2015/11/19 20:33:23] <head8debian> But why? Every other program of mine can play fine./
[2015/11/19 20:33:45] <Tobbi> head8debian: since when?
[2015/11/19 20:33:52] <Tobbi> I mean: Since when do you have this issue?
[2015/11/19 20:34:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: The last couple weeks.
[2015/11/19 20:35:59] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did we change something in the code / can you bisect?
[2015/11/19 20:36:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: I think its local.
[2015/11/19 20:38:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: ask on the openal mailing list...
[2015/11/19 20:38:40] <Tobbi> or in #openal but it might not be very...you know...frequented...
[2015/11/19 20:39:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: How do i git bisect again?
[2015/11/19 20:39:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: check git help bisect
[2015/11/19 20:42:47] <head8debian> hmm.
[2015/11/19 20:44:21] * head8debian is confused...
[2015/11/19 20:45:09] <Tobbi> What's the problem?
[2015/11/19 20:45:15] <head8debian> Nothing now.
[2015/11/19 20:46:12] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 20:48:03] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, let's just hope that the source files will update tomorrow. If they don't...well...
[2015/11/19 20:49:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Undo commit time. :D :p
[2015/11/19 20:49:36] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/19 20:49:44] <head8debian> Everyone panic and call Tobbi! :p
[2015/11/19 20:49:55] <Tobbi> nope, please don't.

[2015/11/19 20:53:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: Can you also update the website to include the supertux editor tutorials written by that guy?
[2015/11/19 20:53:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Must be local. I went back 80 commits and still had the issue.
[2015/11/19 20:53:30] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 20:53:37] <head8debian> If i get around to it
[2015/11/19 20:54:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: "By the way, you may want to add this link to your wiki for the Level Editor - http://dcjtech.info/topic/gaming/#supertux"
[2015/11/19 20:55:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes, i know. :-)
[2015/11/19 20:55:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: I was hoping to make a supetux video but havent gotten that far, and now i have no audio... o_O
[2015/11/19 20:55:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Anyways, i bid you goodnight.
[2015/11/19 20:55:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Ask on the openal mailing list...
[2015/11/19 20:57:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Another mailing list? :p
[2015/11/19 20:57:11] <head8debian> yahoo...
[2015/11/19 20:57:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: https://openal.org/mailman/listinfo/openal
[2015/11/19 20:58:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: I guess that is why i use email filters.
[2015/11/19 20:58:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: What openal version do you use anyway?
[2015/11/19 21:00:03] <head8debian> Tobbi: 1.17
[2015/11/19 21:00:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: I do run Arch now, ya know. :-)
[2015/11/19 21:00:56] <Tobbi> Okay, that seems to be the most recent one.
[2015/11/19 21:01:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: Actually, that was updated 2 days ago.
[2015/11/19 21:01:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Can you switch to an older version?
[2015/11/19 21:02:18] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not without risking breaking my package manager.
[2015/11/19 21:02:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: This is rolling release. Stuff breaks going backwards.
[2015/11/19 21:02:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, then I guess you should really tell the openal guys. This could be the cause of the issue.
[2015/11/19 21:03:00] <head8debian> It didn't happen before hand so its possible.
[2015/11/19 21:03:07] <head8debian> Maybe a reboot will fix it. :p
[2015/11/19 21:03:18] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/19 21:03:20] <Tobbi> try
[2015/11/19 21:03:30] <Tobbi> Anyway, good night

[2015/11/20 07:15:39] <Tobbi> Hello giby
[2015/11/20 07:15:53] <giby> Hi Tobbi
[2015/11/20 07:16:02] <giby> how long B4 M2?
[2015/11/20 07:16:10] <Tobbi> giby: approximately 1 month.
[2015/11/20 07:16:12] <giby> I should update the translations
[2015/11/20 07:16:16] <Tobbi> giby: I just did.
[2015/11/20 07:16:22] <giby> thanks
[2015/11/20 07:16:28] <Tobbi> giby: So, I changed the translations to update automatically from a repository...
[2015/11/20 07:16:39] <Tobbi> which is this one: https://github.com/SuperTux/translations
[2015/11/20 07:16:55] <Tobbi> giby: In order to change the translations, you run makepot.sh which I modified yesterday...
[2015/11/20 07:17:05] <Tobbi> And then commit and push the changed translations.
[2015/11/20 07:17:10] <Tobbi> I hope this works for you.
[2015/11/20 07:17:17] <giby> that is just the pot...
[2015/11/20 07:17:24] <Tobbi> giby: It can import these automatically...
[2015/11/20 07:17:27] <Tobbi> Transifex I mean.
[2015/11/20 07:17:38] <Tobbi> Ah, yes, not the translations, but the template files.
[2015/11/20 07:17:41] <Tobbi> I am talking about those.
[2015/11/20 07:17:50] <giby> I know with the transfix client
[2015/11/20 07:18:00] <giby> have you updated the po files?
[2015/11/20 07:18:14] <Tobbi> giby: Which ones?
[2015/11/20 07:18:22] <giby> all...
[2015/11/20 07:18:33] <Tobbi> giby: No, I haven't. How do you update those?
[2015/11/20 07:18:50] <giby> Ok, I'll do it then ;)
[2015/11/20 07:19:00] <Tobbi> giby: So, I assume you have that transifex python client?
[2015/11/20 07:19:17] <giby> it just need the transfix client, tx pull then commit and push
[2015/11/20 07:19:28] <Tobbi> giby: Shouldn't we wait until just before the milestone to update them?
[2015/11/20 07:19:50] <Tobbi> or what's the catch?
[2015/11/20 07:20:08] <giby> We should do it just before, but some push before are also welcome
[2015/11/20 07:20:23] <Tobbi> giby: Of course. :)
[2015/11/20 07:20:37] <Tobbi> giby: And how do you normally update the translations on transifex? Before I did that change?
[2015/11/20 07:20:55] <giby> for the pot files?
[2015/11/20 07:21:00] <Tobbi> giby: Yes.
[2015/11/20 07:21:12] <giby> I add them manually, there are just few of them
[2015/11/20 07:21:32] <Tobbi> giby: If we add new worlds, no. :P So, please just push the changes to the translations repository.
[2015/11/20 07:21:52] <Tobbi> It's a submodule in the addons repository as well as the normal game repositoy.
[2015/11/20 07:21:55] <Tobbi> *repository
[2015/11/20 07:22:00] <Tobbi> hope you know how that works...
[2015/11/20 07:22:06] <Tobbi> If not, just ask me.
[2015/11/20 07:22:46] <giby> If I need I'll do
[2015/11/20 07:23:12] <giby> Have you already update on the transfix website?
[2015/11/20 07:23:21] <Tobbi> giby: It updates them automatically now.
[2015/11/20 07:23:27] <giby> ok
[2015/11/20 07:23:29] <Tobbi> From the repository here: https://github.com/SuperTux/translations
[2015/11/20 07:23:37] <Tobbi> Those are the pot files.
[2015/11/20 07:24:01] <Tobbi> giby: Plus, I made an announcement yesterday on transifex that the release is in 1 month.
[2015/11/20 07:24:19] <giby> :)
[2015/11/20 07:24:35] <Tobbi> Aka https://www.transifex.com/arctic-games/supertux/announcements/4818/
[2015/11/20 07:25:19] <Tobbi> giby: So, once again, remember not to update translations on transifex using the web interface, but using the repository. Otherwise, it MIGHT corrupt translations.
[2015/11/20 07:25:40] <giby> Ok
[2015/11/20 07:25:43] <Tobbi> Sorry for being extra paranoid about this.
[2015/11/20 07:25:56] <Tobbi> I was afraid something might break yesterday by auto-updating from pot files,
[2015/11/20 07:26:02] <Tobbi> but it worked just fine, what a realive.
[2015/11/20 07:26:03] <Tobbi> relieve
[2015/11/20 07:28:57] <Tobbi> giby: You update the credits for translators manually, don't you?
[2015/11/20 07:29:36] <giby> yes
[2015/11/20 07:30:16] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/20 07:30:59] <giby> sort by alphabetical of last name ;)
[2015/11/20 07:32:39] <Tobbi> giby: Sounds good. Since there's no script, I'll let you do it ;)
[2015/11/20 07:32:51] <Tobbi> I might develop a script to create language add-ons.
[2015/11/20 07:32:55] <Tobbi> Should best happen before the release
[2015/11/20 07:36:02] <giby> ;)
[2015/11/20 07:37:15] <Tobbi> giby: So, what's your workflow in updating translations? You use the transifex client to fetch translations from there...and then?
[2015/11/20 07:37:55] <giby> use tx to download in the repo.. then commit and push
[2015/11/20 07:38:15] <Tobbi> giby: So, you download the .po files from there...then move them in the right place?

[2015/11/20 07:53:11] <leyyin> I hate translations, and Romanian should not be used on computers stuff anyway
[2015/11/20 07:53:16] <leyyin> it sounds and looks so bad :/
[2015/11/20 07:53:40] <leyyin> Tobbi, https://redd.it/3tgiaj
[2015/11/20 07:54:19] <Tobbi> leyyin: if you continue this, google won't employ you again... :P
[2015/11/20 07:54:28] <Tobbi> leyyin: I don't use google chrome that often.
[2015/11/20 07:55:01] <leyyin> firefox is affected too....
[2015/11/20 07:55:24] <Tobbi> really?
[2015/11/20 07:55:26] <Tobbi> wow.
[2015/11/20 07:56:15] <leyyin> it's worse in firefox, no permission systems
[2015/11/20 07:57:21] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2015/11/20 07:58:33] <leyyin> I use firefox btw :P
[2015/11/20 07:58:38] <leyyin> chromium is my second browser
[2015/11/20 07:58:50] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/20 07:58:56] <Tobbi> Yeah, same here.
[2015/11/20 07:59:18] <Tobbi> leyyin: But XUL based add-ons won't work any longer in Firefox. At least according to an announcement made by Mozilla a few months back.
[2015/11/20 08:00:32] <leyyin> yes I know
[2015/11/20 08:00:46] <leyyin> I hope they won't suck as much as the chrome extensions
[2015/11/20 08:00:50] <leyyin> memory wise....
[2015/11/20 08:01:16] <Tobbi> No idea.
[2015/11/20 08:10:05] <Tobbi> leyyin: I once met a nice Romanian girl / woman during a Mozilla event. She had something quite beautiful about her... :P
[2015/11/20 08:10:20] <Tobbi> Well, actually, we worked together in the same project...though she was an employee...

[2015/11/20 10:54:48] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: It was a joke. The @ means he is an OP.

[2015/11/20 12:09:09] <Tobbi> Right...

[2015/11/20 12:10:55] <Tobbi> Fixed release date.
[2015/11/20 12:11:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sure.
[2015/11/20 12:11:41] <Tobbi> Good!
[2015/11/20 12:11:44] <Tobbi> So that's settled.
[2015/11/20 12:12:58] <head8debian> Tobbi: So pretty much everything is done then?
[2015/11/20 12:13:19] <head8debian> Unless we need to change our config to support the latest OpenAL. :D
[2015/11/20 12:13:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't know, yet. I'd love to have langpacks automatically download when people select a language...but not sure if that's possible.
[2015/11/20 12:14:03] <Tobbi> And not sure whether that wouldn't cause problems.
[2015/11/20 12:14:09] <head8debian> That would be nice. How do we do it currently?
[2015/11/20 12:14:21] <Tobbi> head8debian: You download langpacks manually through the add-on manager.
[2015/11/20 12:14:36] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/11/20 12:14:45] <head8debian> Well, that isn't extremely hard then.
[2015/11/20 12:15:03] <Tobbi> I am not sure what can go wrong there...
[2015/11/20 12:15:20] <head8debian> My grandma might find it hard though. :D
[2015/11/20 12:15:24] <head8debian> Sorry grandma. :)

[2015/11/20 12:20:34] <head8debian> Tobbi: It was kinda funny. Her computer wouldnt turn on and she wondered if our internet was down. :D

[2015/11/20 12:31:24] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Ubuntu LTS gets pittifull updates after the first 3 years are up.
[2015/11/20 12:31:40] <head8debian> And the packages are *old*.
[2015/11/20 12:32:15] <brmbrmcar> I mean Chrome Os.
[2015/11/20 12:32:34] <brmbrmcar> I will get LTS 16.04
[2015/11/20 12:32:48] <Tobbi> head8debian: Package maintainers will update automatically, won't they? I mean: once we release it?
[2015/11/20 12:32:52] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Isn't Chrome OS rolling release though? WOn't it get updated forever?
[2015/11/20 12:33:18] <head8debian> Tobbi: Not in any already relesed versions of OSes.
[2015/11/20 12:33:21] <head8debian> released*
[2015/11/20 12:33:34] <head8debian> Ubuntu 14.04 wont, debian 8 wont, Fedora 23 wont, etc.
[2015/11/20 12:33:35] <Tobbi> head8debian: Not? So, if people run apt-get update it won't update?
[2015/11/20 12:33:47] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Yeah, but this device in particular won't be "supported".
[2015/11/20 12:33:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: They won't push a newer version to their repos.
[2015/11/20 12:33:54] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Ah,
[2015/11/20 12:33:57] <Tobbi> I see...
[2015/11/20 12:34:00] <Tobbi> Well, what a shame.
[2015/11/20 12:34:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: They fix bugs, but wont push newer versions.
[2015/11/20 12:34:07] <head8debian> Yes it is.
[2015/11/20 12:34:11] <Tobbi> right.
[2015/11/20 12:34:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: Otherwise none of these OSes would have new packages, and they would be rolling release kindof.
[2015/11/20 12:34:46] <Tobbi> yes, right.

[2015/11/20 16:04:55] <head8debian> Hey Tobbi.
[2015/11/20 16:05:00] <Tobbi> hey, head8debian
[2015/11/20 16:05:14] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats up? :D
[2015/11/20 16:05:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: The ceiling.
[2015/11/20 16:05:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/20 16:06:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Only nerds respond that way... :p
[2015/11/20 16:06:17] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, people who are tired of that question as well.
[2015/11/20 16:06:45] <brmbrmcar> What's down?
[2015/11/20 16:06:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: True.
[2015/11/20 16:07:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: I usually respond that way.
[2015/11/20 16:07:05] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: The floor.
[2015/11/20 16:07:42] <brmbrmcar> How id the floor?
[2015/11/20 16:07:49] <brmbrmcar> My floor is lava.
[2015/11/20 16:08:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: But, a lot of people have at least translated the menu principale on supertux...
[2015/11/20 16:08:17] <Tobbi> eeh transifex, I mean.
[2015/11/20 16:08:34] <head8debian> Ah.
[2015/11/20 16:09:04] <head8debian> Tobbi: Mixxx is awesome. :D
[2015/11/20 16:09:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: What is it?
[2015/11/20 16:10:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: A program... :-)
[2015/11/20 16:10:26] <brmbrmcar> http://www.mixxx.org/
[2015/11/20 16:10:39] <Tobbi> open source, wow.
[2015/11/20 16:11:11] <brmbrmcar> I like looking at code for closed code stuff.
[2015/11/20 16:11:23] <brmbrmcar> Well, I would like to.
[2015/11/20 16:13:38] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Open Source code is supposed to be better...
[2015/11/20 16:13:49] <Tobbi> as in: Better maintained etc.
[2015/11/20 16:14:54] <brmbrmcar> Yeah,but it isn't as fun to see the source of it, because anyone can.
[2015/11/20 16:15:19] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/20 16:15:31] <Tobbi> Also, alket's quit message is an excerpt from Harry Potter I.
[2015/11/20 16:15:34] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/20 16:15:39] <head8debian> Tobbi: Google should be shot. Have you seen their new youtube and google plus layout?
[2015/11/20 16:15:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: I wondered where it was from... i don't like it.
[2015/11/20 16:15:59] <Tobbi> giby_the_kid: Up to which percentage of translated items do you include the lang file...
[2015/11/20 16:16:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: You don't like Harry Potter? Have you ever read it?
[2015/11/20 16:16:50] <brmbrmcar> I've never read Harry Potter.
[2015/11/20 16:16:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: No, and i don't like it from its reviews.
[2015/11/20 16:17:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why not? What's wrong with it?
[2015/11/20 16:17:47] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: I agree there.
[2015/11/20 16:19:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Witchcraft, magic and other dark things...
[2015/11/20 16:19:32] <Tobbi> head8debian: *sigh*
[2015/11/20 16:19:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: That we don't need to infilterate our brains with.
[2015/11/20 16:19:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did you decide it or did your parents decide that you don't like it? ;)
[2015/11/20 16:20:02] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats wrong with Google plus? Too much javascript. :D
[2015/11/20 16:20:05] <head8debian> Tobbi: Both. :D
[2015/11/20 16:20:07] <Tobbi> ok.
[2015/11/20 16:20:18] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Wow. We agree on something. :-)
[2015/11/20 16:20:30] <brmbrmcar> I hate the term "magic".
[2015/11/20 16:20:53] <head8debian> I'm not fond of it either.
[2015/11/20 16:21:28] <head8debian> Tobbi: And what good does it profit you to read stuff like that? Read something that has at least some educational value. Like the Chronicles of Narnia. :D
[2015/11/20 16:21:31] <brmbrmcar> People say I ama magicain because I can use inertia.
[2015/11/20 16:21:57] <brmbrmcar> Read How to hackWindows and Mac by brmbrmcar.
[2015/11/20 16:22:08] <head8debian> Tobbi: What does the fox say has no bass.
[2015/11/20 16:22:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: You don't want to tell me that Harry Potter doesn't have educational value, do you? Because the bible doesn't have that, either... :P
[2015/11/20 16:22:42] <brmbrmcar> Uh oh...
[2015/11/20 16:22:48] <Tobbi> I know...
[2015/11/20 16:22:54] * head8debian /ignore 's Tobbi...
[2015/11/20 16:23:01] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/20 16:23:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am serious...
[2015/11/20 16:23:05] * brmbrmcar hides
[2015/11/20 16:23:24] <Tobbi> Tell me about the educational value of the bible?
[2015/11/20 16:24:04] <brmbrmcar> It does mention some things about how to be good.
[2015/11/20 16:24:34] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So does Harry Potter. We have the good side ("White wizards") and the bad side "death eaters"...
[2015/11/20 16:25:00] <brmbrmcar> I like books about brm brm cars.
[2015/11/20 16:25:09] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: ...and that's where you get annoying.
[2015/11/20 16:25:10] <brmbrmcar> And hacking.
[2015/11/20 16:25:12] <Tobbi> Can't you stop that?
[2015/11/20 16:26:04] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Have fun hacking my SSH connection...
[2015/11/20 16:26:27] <brmbrmcar> No fun.
[2015/11/20 16:26:32] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, I was quite serious about that question: Where is the educational value in the bible?

[2015/11/20 16:26:52] <brmbrmcar> I like teddy bear books for toddlers.
[2015/11/20 16:27:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: Did you really ignore me?
[2015/11/20 16:27:38] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Did you really ignore Tobbi?
[2015/11/20 16:28:03] <head8debian> Yep. :D
[2015/11/20 16:28:13] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: Yep. :D
[2015/11/20 16:28:23] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I can see his answers...
[2015/11/20 16:28:41] <brmbrmcar> Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[2015/11/20 16:29:34] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/20 16:30:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about other books, like lord of the rings?
[2015/11/20 16:30:39] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: What about otherbooks, like Lord of the rings? (by Tobbi)
[2015/11/20 16:30:58] <Tobbi> Can you un-ignore me, please? I didn't say anything offensive
[2015/11/20 16:31:00] <Tobbi> Not remotely.
[2015/11/20 16:31:22] <head8debian> Ive never read it, but have never had any intrest in reading it either.
[2015/11/20 16:31:46] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Can you un-ignore Tobbi, please? Tobbi didn't say anything offensiv
[2015/11/20 16:32:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im not big into very popular books...
[2015/11/20 16:32:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: OKay...that I can understand.
[2015/11/20 16:32:55] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Did you un-ignore?
[2015/11/20 16:33:03] <head8debian> I actually have not read much lately. :-)
[2015/11/20 16:33:17] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Uhm, how would i answer his questions otherwise?
[2015/11/20 16:33:36] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/20 16:33:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, basically... Everything has to be taken with a grain of salt... And the "magic" in Harry Potter is just not the central topic there... It's the relationships between the characters...
[2015/11/20 16:34:05] <brmbrmcar> Most popular books are rubbish.
[2015/11/20 16:34:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: I still have no interest in it...
[2015/11/20 16:34:13] <Tobbi> I am just saying.
[2015/11/20 16:34:22] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What popular books have you read?
[2015/11/20 16:34:43] <brmbrmcar> Er...
[2015/11/20 16:34:48] <Tobbi> yes?
[2015/11/20 16:35:05] <brmbrmcar> I havre only heard about them...
[2015/11/20 16:35:23] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So, wait a second: Your opinion is based on something you have never actually read?
[2015/11/20 16:35:26] <head8debian> Tobbi: I prefer books i can relate to more also.
[2015/11/20 16:35:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Relate to in what way?
[2015/11/20 16:36:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: Harry Potter is someone who goes to wizarding school (just like normal school except the subjects are different), his parents are dead, killed by a very bad man...
[2015/11/20 16:36:12] <brmbrmcar> I only like young childrens' books.
[2015/11/20 16:36:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Like its more of real life!
[2015/11/20 16:37:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im reading this book currently. :D http://www.amazon.com/Teach-Yourself-Electricity-Electronics-Edition/dp/0071741356
[2015/11/20 16:37:51] <head8debian> Actually the 3rd edition, but still...
[2015/11/20 16:37:54] <Tobbi> Okay, that might be interesting...
[2015/11/20 16:38:27] <Tobbi> head8debian: I like this book very much: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Game
[2015/11/20 16:38:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Only 720 pages. :D

[2015/11/20 16:40:43] <Tobbi> or something...
[2015/11/20 16:41:06] <brmbrmcar> Yes... it is actually interesting!
[2015/11/20 16:41:18] <Tobbi> I wouldn't say so...

[2015/11/20 16:45:51] <brmbrmcar> I like good English.
[2015/11/20 16:45:53] <Tobbi> *sigh* I really can't think of why anyone wouldn't like Harry Potter...
[2015/11/20 16:46:11] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Sometimes I think you're someone in your 20s just messing with us.
[2015/11/20 16:46:18] <Tobbi> But, no, you act too immature for that.
[2015/11/20 16:46:28] <Tobbi> But I'd say you're as old as head8debian at least...
[2015/11/20 16:46:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: Thats like me saying i cannot see why no one wouldn't like the Bible or doing what it says.

[2015/11/20 16:48:32] <head8debian> Its harsh, but its what i believe...
[2015/11/20 16:48:46] <brmbrmcar> Is that why you drive a truck?
[2015/11/20 16:48:58] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: :-) Not really.
[2015/11/20 16:49:08] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Trucks are personal opinion.

[2015/11/20 16:49:08] <red_bot> alket, you have notes! [Nov-20 16:44] <head8debian> much better quit message. :D
[2015/11/20 16:49:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, so if you're insane and kill someone while having an episode, you deserve to be killed?
[2015/11/20 16:49:13] <alket> they send the Hagrids dragon to Romania :p
[2015/11/20 16:49:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yep.

[2015/11/20 16:49:42] <leyyin> alket, yup
[2015/11/20 16:49:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: Or someone told you to kill a person and because of your borderline intelligence you do it without thinking about the consequences...
[2015/11/20 16:49:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: And whats that mean? I only understand English. :D
[2015/11/20 16:49:59] <Tobbi> You still deserve to be killed?
[2015/11/20 16:50:13] <head8debian> Tobbi: Pretty much, yes.

[2015/11/20 16:55:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: okay, so my brother has got down's syndrome...If someone put a gun in his hands and told him to pull the trigger, my brother would deserve to die for doing it?
[2015/11/20 16:55:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sadly, yes. Hopefully no one does that though...
[2015/11/20 16:56:04] * head8debian looks at Tobbi.
[2015/11/20 16:56:26] <Tobbi> head8debian: There is no way on earth that he can be considered responsible for what he did...You never make exceptions, do you?
[2015/11/20 16:57:00] <Tobbi> This is cruel.
[2015/11/20 16:57:09] * brmbrmcar is confused...
[2015/11/20 16:57:18] <head8debian> It is cruel, but its what i belive to be correct.
[2015/11/20 16:57:30] <head8debian> I do belive in a couple exceptions though.
[2015/11/20 16:57:50] <brmbrmcar> You believe an exact set of things?
[2015/11/20 16:58:07] <head8debian> If you shoot out of self defence and kill someone i belive that as an exception.
[2015/11/20 16:58:12] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, assume the following: Two patients were fatally hurt and a doctor doesn't have time to treat both of them, so he has to make a choice whom to treat and the other one dies. Does the doctor deserve to be killed for making a choice?
[2015/11/20 16:58:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: No, he did not willingly kill the person.
[2015/11/20 16:58:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: Neither did my brother whom I give the gun.
[2015/11/20 16:58:48] <brmbrmcar> Get another doctor?
[2015/11/20 16:58:51] <Tobbi> Where do you draw the line.
[2015/11/20 16:58:53] <head8debian> I would probably consider your brother an exception also...
[2015/11/20 16:58:55] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I am very serious.
[2015/11/20 16:58:57] <head8debian> Im thinking. :-)
[2015/11/20 16:59:08] <head8debian> Ive never had to draw this line so deep before...
[2015/11/20 16:59:23] @ Quit: alket: Remote host closed the connection
[2015/11/20 17:00:01] <head8debian> Tobbi: I'd consider you the one to have to die if you gave your brother the gun *and* told your brother to go kill someone...
[2015/11/20 17:00:23] <head8debian> Yes, im puting it bluntly, but you asked.
[2015/11/20 17:00:28] <Tobbi> It's okay...
[2015/11/20 17:00:39] <Tobbi> You making up your mind was all I wanted, really.
[2015/11/20 17:01:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: What if I didn't tell my brother to kill the person?
[2015/11/20 17:01:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: If he did it without any guidance i would probably consider it an exception...
[2015/11/20 17:01:21] <Tobbi> but still gave him the gun?
[2015/11/20 17:01:31] <head8debian> WHy would you give him a gun?
[2015/11/20 17:01:50] <Tobbi> head8debian: *that* is a good question...But assuming I did give him the gun...just because...
[2015/11/20 17:01:51] <head8debian> Unless you have some devius scheme in your head. :p
[2015/11/20 17:02:21] <Tobbi> okay, let's see...
[2015/11/20 17:03:19] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about doctors who grant a person euthanasia...so the person wants to die because he'd be facing a horrible death otherwise, because he's fatally ill...And the doctor grants that requests, ergo kills that person...
[2015/11/20 17:03:25] <Tobbi> Is he a murderer?
[2015/11/20 17:03:44] <Tobbi> -> does the doctor need to die for granting a wish?
[2015/11/20 17:03:47] <head8debian> Tobbi: But i do know how hard it is to have to deal with people who have "issues" like your brother.
[2015/11/20 17:04:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: It doesn't matter, it was only an example...
[2015/11/20 17:04:32] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't belive it right that the doctor would do such a thing, but it was the mans choice.
[2015/11/20 17:05:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, but was that choice an independent one?
[2015/11/20 17:05:16] <head8debian> Now, abortion, thats a diferent story. The baby didn't chose to be put to death.
[2015/11/20 17:05:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: What?
[2015/11/20 17:05:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, abortion now: Did the baby choose to live?
[2015/11/20 17:05:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: It would have if it had the chance to...
[2015/11/20 17:06:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: How do we always get onto subjects like these? ;)
[2015/11/20 17:06:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, what if people have sex with the goal to get the woman pregnant, but she doesn't conceive...
[2015/11/20 17:06:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats concieve mean?
[2015/11/20 17:07:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Get pregnant
[2015/11/20 17:07:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: What about it?
[2015/11/20 17:07:19] <head8debian> She cannot help that, he cannot help that.
[2015/11/20 17:07:30] <Tobbi> head8debian: Still, it's a life that was killed before it was born...
[2015/11/20 17:07:34] <Tobbi> Kill both of them?
[2015/11/20 17:07:45] <head8debian> It was a life that was never started.
[2015/11/20 17:07:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: When does a life start?
[2015/11/20 17:08:02] <Tobbi> What *is* a life anyway?
[2015/11/20 17:08:02] <head8debian> Upon Conception.
[2015/11/20 17:08:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: A Egg is a egg untill conception. It is nothing and will be nothing without any interaction.
[2015/11/20 17:09:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: But, wait a second: If the two separate parts haven't been life, how can they together become life?
[2015/11/20 17:09:12] <Tobbi> That doesn't make any sense.
[2015/11/20 17:09:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: Sex. :)
[2015/11/20 17:09:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, sex means that something that is not alive certainly becomes alive (through witchcraft?)
[2015/11/20 17:10:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its mearly interaction.
[2015/11/20 17:10:30] <head8debian> Tobbi: Is combining baking soda and vinegar witchcraft?
[2015/11/20 17:10:45] <head8debian> That was vague, but...
[2015/11/20 17:10:52] <Tobbi> head8debian: Is the combination of soda and vinegar alive?
[2015/11/20 17:11:38] <head8debian> Tobbi: In some ways, yes, but i was using it as a reference. Without the 2 things they are nothing, when they join during fertalization it become something.
[2015/11/20 17:11:49] @ Quit: leyyin: Quit: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
[2015/11/20 17:12:10] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, another example: Assuming a woman has sex against her will...aka was forced to have sex...And she conceives...
[2015/11/20 17:12:29] <Tobbi> So, she has to give birth to a child...even though she didn't want to conceive in the first place...and she has to care for the child?
[2015/11/20 17:12:32] <head8debian> I don't belive it right for the baby to die.
[2015/11/20 17:13:01] <head8debian> Pretty much, yes.
[2015/11/20 17:13:05] <Tobbi> head8debian: Would you believe it right for her to give birth to a baby she nver wanted?
[2015/11/20 17:13:19] <head8debian> Yes.
[2015/11/20 17:13:31] <Tobbi> head8debian: And what then?
[2015/11/20 17:13:45] <head8debian> Its sad when forced sex happens, but i don't believe the chile should be killed.
[2015/11/20 17:13:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: What then what?
[2015/11/20 17:13:57] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, at which point can a child be considered a child?
[2015/11/20 17:14:13] <head8debian> Tobbi: I consider it at the point of conception.
[2015/11/20 17:14:25] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, so what's the definition of "child"?
[2015/11/20 17:14:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: What do you think? :-)
[2015/11/20 17:14:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: a conveived ovum is just "a bunch of cells"...
[2015/11/20 17:15:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: You are "just a bunch of cells".
[2015/11/20 17:15:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: So is cancer. According to your definition, you'd refuse a person chemo therapy because of that?
[2015/11/20 17:16:00] <Tobbi> As in, let a person die, because killing that "bunch of cells" which is cancer is morally wrong?
[2015/11/20 17:16:50] <head8debian> Tobbi: What? You are starting to make no sense.
[2015/11/20 17:17:34] <Tobbi> head8debian: A fertilized ovum is a bunch of cells, so is a tumor... Since you believe that both is life and neither of those should be killed...
[2015/11/20 17:17:51] <Tobbi> That means refuse a person chemo therapy (which includes killing the tumor)
[2015/11/20 17:17:55] <Tobbi> Is that what you believe?
[2015/11/20 17:18:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: No i don't, because there is a diference between the begining of a life's cells and a cancer cell. We are not born with cancer cells. Cancer cells do not belong in our bodies in the first place.
[2015/11/20 17:19:23] <head8debian> I don't like the methods of removing them, but thats the persons choice.
[2015/11/20 17:20:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: Cancer cells are "the beginning of life".
[2015/11/20 17:20:20] <Tobbi> Of their cancer cell.
[2015/11/20 17:20:26] <Tobbi> They're cells = they are life.
[2015/11/20 17:20:48] <Tobbi> Your body contains several kinds of different cells...
[2015/11/20 17:21:04] <Tobbi> head8debian: Where do you draw the line?
[2015/11/20 17:21:06] <head8debian> Tobbi: No they are not! Its like saying that my motherboard here will one day turn into a printer.
[2015/11/20 17:21:19] <head8debian> Not that my mobo is cancerous. :p
[2015/11/20 17:21:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: How do you define life?
[2015/11/20 17:30:32] <brmbrmcar> Awkward
[2015/11/20 17:31:19] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What's your opinion?
[2015/11/20 17:31:25] <brmbrmcar> On life?
[2015/11/20 17:31:32] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: On anything we just discussed.
[2015/11/20 17:32:03] <brmbrmcar> Well, why just humans?
[2015/11/20 17:32:04] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Or: How would you define life?
[2015/11/20 17:32:23] <brmbrmcar> Er, it is where smething is in control.
[2015/11/20 17:32:42] <brmbrmcar> That is all I'd say.
[2015/11/20 17:33:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Elaborate.
[2015/11/20 17:33:48] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/20 17:34:04] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I meant: Explain what you mean.
[2015/11/20 17:34:46] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2015/11/20 17:35:07] <brmbrmcar> I am talking more physics, the only explanation I could say.
[2015/11/20 17:35:44] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So, how does something look which isn't in control? Or: Are dead things not in control in terms of physics?
[2015/11/20 17:36:13] <brmbrmcar> A computer.
[2015/11/20 17:36:24] <brmbrmcar> I mean in control of itself directly.
[2015/11/20 17:37:05] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How do you define control? Doesn't control depend on a certain... willfullness?
[2015/11/20 17:37:58] <brmbrmcar> Like, of your own body.
[2015/11/20 17:39:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: We humans aren't completely rational beings...
[2015/11/20 17:39:29] <Tobbi> Thus, our motivation for doing something are not completely "controlled" by us...
[2015/11/20 17:40:50] <brmbrmcar> Yeah...
[2015/11/20 17:41:18] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Okay, animals are often driven by instincts...Are they in control?
[2015/11/20 17:42:24] <brmbrmcar> Yes, in theory
[2015/11/20 17:42:32] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: In theory?
[2015/11/20 17:42:39] <Tobbi> Elaborate on that, please.
[2015/11/20 17:44:04] <brmbrmcar> I am confused.
[2015/11/20 17:44:06] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/20 17:45:20] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What is control? Assuming you refused to eat and drink...are you in control of staying alive?
[2015/11/20 17:46:45] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/20 17:46:57] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How, if you refused to eat and drink?
[2015/11/20 17:47:23] <brmbrmcar> Don't refuse?
[2015/11/20 17:47:33] <brmbrmcar> If you couldn't then no.
[2015/11/20 17:48:13] <red_bot> Delay note from 'head8debian' written on 11-20-15 at 17:22PM "I will be back around 10PM tonight, sorry to have to run so fast".
[2015/11/20 17:48:30] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: But, wait, you said that you are in total control...
[2015/11/20 17:48:44] <brmbrmcar> Not of death.
[2015/11/20 17:48:58] <brmbrmcar> I am not thinking religously.
[2015/11/20 17:49:49] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Total control would mean being objective regarding everything right? Because otherwise, your control would be biased...
[2015/11/20 17:49:57] <Tobbi> And thus you wouldn't have total unbiased control...
[2015/11/20 17:50:11] <Tobbi> However, humans are never unbiased.
[2015/11/20 17:50:20] <Tobbi> Our bias is what separates us from machines.
[2015/11/20 17:50:32] <brmbrmcar> Control generally.
[2015/11/20 17:50:48] <brmbrmcar> A machine has no soul.
[2015/11/20 17:51:01] <brmbrmcar> Apart from robots.
[2015/11/20 17:51:16] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Control is only control when you're equally likely to do certain things.
[2015/11/20 17:51:30] <Tobbi> In my opinion.
[2015/11/20 17:51:59] <Tobbi> Control is when you have equal, unbiased choices that you can take.
[2015/11/20 17:52:02] <Tobbi> But life isn't like that.
[2015/11/20 17:52:10] <brmbrmcar> But you are choosing to type now!
[2015/11/20 17:52:16] <brmbrmcar> That is control.
[2015/11/20 17:52:35] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: hmm...
[2015/11/20 17:53:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: assuming I decided to kill a person earlier, and I am now in jail... And I chose to go home...
[2015/11/20 17:53:24] <Tobbi> I would have no way...
[2015/11/20 17:53:38] <Tobbi> Thus, I am not in total control.
[2015/11/20 17:53:42] <brmbrmcar> Yes, that is more physical.
[2015/11/20 17:53:50] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Physical?
[2015/11/20 17:53:53] <brmbrmcar> Your body cannot do it.
[2015/11/20 17:54:06] <brmbrmcar> Your hardware.
[2015/11/20 17:54:17] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Where do you draw the line? Isn't control dependent on other factors as well?
[2015/11/20 17:54:29] <Tobbi> On external factors, like society and the world around you?
[2015/11/20 17:54:53] <brmbrmcar> External factors can be choice.
[2015/11/20 17:55:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Even if choose to, I wouldn't be able to leave the prison...
[2015/11/20 17:55:18] <Tobbi> Or get any girlfriend I wanted for that matter.
[2015/11/20 17:55:23] <Tobbi> So choice is limited.
[2015/11/20 17:55:42] <Tobbi> You don't become almighty only because you have a choice.
[2015/11/20 17:56:05] <brmbrmcar> You can't write an operating system to make your computer waterproof.
[2015/11/20 17:56:25] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So you're not in total control...
[2015/11/20 17:56:30] <brmbrmcar> But you can make it play SuperTux.
[2015/11/20 17:56:38] <Tobbi> Your choice is severely limited by external factors...
[2015/11/20 17:56:44] <brmbrmcar> But it can't always hack.
[2015/11/20 17:57:42] <brmbrmcar> That is my best explanation.
[2015/11/20 17:58:08] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: My point is: If your choice is limited by external factors, that means you're not in total control...
[2015/11/20 17:59:10] <brmbrmcar> Exactly.
[2015/11/20 17:59:32] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: But that means you're not alive.
[2015/11/20 18:00:01] <brmbrmcar> How?
[2015/11/20 18:00:07] <brmbrmcar> I have a soul.
[2015/11/20 18:00:19] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Since your definition of "being alive" is "being in control"...
[2015/11/20 18:00:21] <Tobbi> But you're not in control...
[2015/11/20 18:00:30] <Tobbi> there are things beyond your control.
[2015/11/20 18:01:13] <brmbrmcar> Being alive is having a soul.
[2015/11/20 18:01:20] <brmbrmcar> And the control.
[2015/11/20 18:01:38] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: How do you define having a soul?
[2015/11/20 18:01:54] <brmbrmcar> Soemthing you xan think with.
[2015/11/20 18:02:01] <brmbrmcar> Choose tothink with.
[2015/11/20 18:02:14] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: So anything which can think is alive?
[2015/11/20 18:02:23] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What about plants...do plants "think"?
[2015/11/20 18:02:26] <Tobbi> How do you define thinking?
[2015/11/20 18:02:49] <Tobbi> Plants adapt to the environment around them, I believe without thinking...Thus they're not alive?
[2015/11/20 18:03:39] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/20 18:04:05] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Okay, but bacteria don't think either. Not alive?
[2015/11/20 18:04:10] <Tobbi> Or cancer cells...
[2015/11/20 18:04:14] <Tobbi> Or fertilized ovae.
[2015/11/20 18:04:23] <Tobbi> So, all of these things are not alive?
[2015/11/20 18:06:29] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/20 18:06:41] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2015/11/20 18:06:55] <brmbrmcar> Who said they wre?
[2015/11/20 18:06:58] @ alket joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/20 18:07:06] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: But you are a collection of cells... So if these are not alive because themselves they don't think...how can the resulting human be alive?
[2015/11/20 18:07:29] <brmbrmcar> I am not a scientist.

[2015/11/20 19:53:55] <Tobbi> Alright.
[2015/11/20 19:54:06] <Karkus> Tobbi: What do you mean?
[2015/11/20 19:54:19] <Tobbi> Karkus: I updated localizations on transifex, using makepot.sh to create the files.
[2015/11/20 19:54:30] <Tobbi> I set it to update automatically from a git submodule, and even that worked.
[2015/11/20 19:54:33] <Tobbi> I was quite surprised.
[2015/11/20 19:54:41] <Tobbi> I expected localizations to be lost.

[2015/11/21 08:56:22] <Tobbi> let me try to get a better stacktrace.
[2015/11/21 08:56:36] <grumbel> the libsupertux2 is needed for googletest, if you build with 'cmake .. -DBUILD_TEST=ON' it will create supertux2 and test_supertux2
[2015/11/21 08:56:43] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/11/21 08:56:56] <grumbel> run with supertux --debug, that should print the file where it goes broke
[2015/11/21 08:57:42] <Tobbi> Yes, one moment.
[2015/11/21 08:57:55] <Tobbi> my gdb is going mad right now.

[2015/11/21 09:01:06] <grumbel> you could try compiling sexp-cpp with: cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWARNINGS=ON -DWERROR=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
[2015/11/21 09:01:14] <Tobbi> okay...

[2015/11/21 09:02:59] <grumbel> compiling supertux with 'cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON' and then running 'build/test_supertux2' is also worth a try

[2015/11/21 09:23:42] <Tobbi> Value::Destroy() calls the destructor of m_cons.
[2015/11/21 09:23:55] <Tobbi> Which in turn calls Value::Destroy()
[2015/11/21 09:23:58] <Tobbi> At least that|s what I can see..
[2015/11/21 09:24:20] <grumbel> it should be calling destroy() on another sexp::Value, not on the same
[2015/11/21 09:24:31] <grumbel> it's probably some invalid pointer dereference foobar
[2015/11/21 09:25:33] <Tobbi> I already checked against NULL...doesn|t make any difference.

[2015/11/21 09:36:10] <Tobbi> Or one of hume's?
[2015/11/21 09:39:04] <Karkus> It's impossible trying to find a level when you don't know which of christoph1, christoph2 and christoph3 it is

[2015/11/21 09:48:52] <Karkus> Tobbi: As in, an issue regarding the way stats are saved.
[2015/11/21 09:49:13] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes...Something like "Rework stats"
[2015/11/21 09:49:15] <Tobbi> Or something.
[2015/11/21 09:49:19] <Tobbi> I don't know.
[2015/11/21 09:49:38] <Tobbi> We could save an arbitrary ID in the stl file...
[2015/11/21 09:49:42] <Tobbi> and then set that...
[2015/11/21 09:49:51] <Karkus> Tobbi: But then again, the forest world isn't exactly supposed to be stable anyway, so we could merge this now...
[2015/11/21 09:49:59] <Tobbi> Yes, that's true.
[2015/11/21 09:50:09] <Tobbi> It's not supposed to be stable until about now :P
[2015/11/21 09:50:13] <Karkus> Tobbi: I reckon we do both
[2015/11/21 09:50:19] <Karkus> Tobbi: Well, it just isn't

[2015/11/21 10:01:53] <Tobbi> He's proven himself worthwhile.
[2015/11/21 10:05:27] <brmbrmcar> I can take screenshots.

[2015/11/21 10:34:27] <Karkus> Or does it follow him off screen?

[2015/11/21 12:45:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Ah.
[2015/11/21 12:45:14] <Karkus> Okay
[2015/11/21 12:46:23] <brmbrmcar> Earth Tux's light should only be an aid, and not react with blocks.
[2015/11/21 12:46:40] <brmbrmcar> Otherwise it makes the game actually harder.
[2015/11/21 12:47:13] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: This is a feature for levels which I have considered basing a whole level around.
[2015/11/21 12:47:25] <Karkus> All light should do this.
[2015/11/21 12:47:47] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but then the light should be 360.
[2015/11/21 12:48:17] <Karkus> Err, well, no.

[2015/11/21 12:49:15] <Karkus> Or maybe not :D

[2015/11/21 12:51:21] <Karkus> Mr Candle isn't a magic block
[2015/11/21 12:51:36] <brmbrmcar> I have a feeling it will throw up a bug.

[2015/11/21 13:14:41] <head8debian> Tobbi: Did i do something wrong?
[2015/11/21 13:15:44] <Tobbi> head8debian: No, perfectly fine.
[2015/11/21 13:15:49] <head8debian> :-)
[2015/11/21 13:16:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why is that (target-time 0) added, though?
[2015/11/21 13:16:51] <brmbrmcar> New level editor does that.
[2015/11/21 13:17:06] <brmbrmcar> It doesn't make any difference.
[2015/11/21 13:17:23] <head8debian> Tobbi: I have no clue.
[2015/11/21 13:17:35] <Tobbi> The new level editor should be changed in that aspect.

[2015/11/21 13:18:10] <brmbrmcar> Why?
[2015/11/21 13:18:22] <brmbrmcar> It is only time wasting.
[2015/11/21 13:18:24] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: worldmaps don't have a target time at all.
[2015/11/21 13:19:39] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but it makes no difference to anything.
[2015/11/21 13:19:53] <head8debian> Tobbi: I don't know why that line showed up. I was puzzled myself.
[2015/11/21 13:20:16] <Tobbi> head8debian: You can edit it out with a text editor, commit, squash...

[2015/11/21 13:21:42] <brmbrmcar> Maybe target times can be automatically deleted if set to zero, but it still shouldn't bother worldmaps.
[2015/11/21 13:22:25] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Removing it can be done quickly...
[2015/11/21 13:23:01] <brmbrmcar> And anyway, it's a nice way to see if something's been updated.

[2015/11/21 14:16:15] <Fire_> Yeah, my first name would be more adequate to what I'm trying to do!
[2015/11/21 14:16:18] <brmbrmcar> Doyou want to compile Supertux?
[2015/11/21 14:16:34] <Fire_> Trying to compile it on WIndows with VS 2013
[2015/11/21 14:16:40] <Tobbi> oh...
[2015/11/21 14:16:47] <Fire_> xD
[2015/11/21 14:16:52] <brmbrmcar> Haven't a clue how.
[2015/11/21 14:17:00] <brmbrmcar> I am the idiot around here.
[2015/11/21 14:17:13] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Stop it!
[2015/11/21 14:17:13] <Fire_> I compile it, but when I try to run it, gives the error: 0xc00007b
[2015/11/21 14:17:25] <Tobbi> That's not very verboe.
[2015/11/21 14:17:27] <Tobbi> verbose
[2015/11/21 14:19:07] <Fire_> I followed the steps here: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/INSTALL.md
[2015/11/21 14:19:20] <Fire_> But I had to copy some .dll manually
[2015/11/21 14:22:54] <Tobbi> Fire_: Do you have WinDBG installed? Or some other debugger?
[2015/11/21 14:23:24] <Fire_> Going to check with that
[2015/11/21 14:23:30] <brmbrmcar> Are you mixing 32 bit and 64 bit dlls?
[2015/11/21 14:23:51] <Tobbi> Fire_: Would you know how to get a backtrace? If so, go ahead.
[2015/11/21 14:23:52] <Fire_> Think not.
[2015/11/21 14:24:29] <Fire_> (about the DLL I mean)
[2015/11/21 14:24:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: Maybe they are just busy.
[2015/11/21 14:25:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: No. one person walked past me and I said "Good day" or something and she pretended that she didn't hear me.
[2015/11/21 14:25:08] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/21 14:26:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: As i said, she was preoccupied. Just because they may seem rude doesn't mean that you have to seem rude back. :D
[2015/11/21 14:26:24] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am never explicitly rude.
[2015/11/21 14:26:31] <Tobbi> implicitly, maybe.
[2015/11/21 14:26:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: Well good...
[2015/11/21 14:27:15] <brmbrmcar> Fire_: OK. Er...
[2015/11/21 14:27:24] <Tobbi> head8debian: by the way: Wouldn't it be cool if you could create your own badguys from a lisp definition file?
[2015/11/21 14:27:25] <Fire_> I'm trying some stuff out, meanwhile
[2015/11/21 14:27:57] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/21 14:28:21] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, maybe?
[2015/11/21 14:28:55] <Tobbi> Or not...I don't know.
[2015/11/21 14:29:18] <brmbrmcar> Fire_: All I could see about the error was 32 and 64 bit stuff getting muddled.
[2015/11/21 14:29:28] <brmbrmcar> Might be to do with Supertux...
[2015/11/21 14:30:03] <Fire_> I'm using the dependencies from INSTALL.md, the only dll i had to copy manually was ssleay32.dll
[2015/11/21 14:30:23] <brmbrmcar> And were the others 64?
[2015/11/21 14:30:36] <brmbrmcar> sslway seems like 32 bit.
[2015/11/21 14:30:51] <head8debian> Tobbi: O_O
[2015/11/21 14:31:06] <Fire_> Others seem to be 32 too
[2015/11/21 14:31:17] <brmbrmcar> OK, then.
[2015/11/21 14:31:25] <Tobbi> head8debian: What?
[2015/11/21 14:31:41] <brmbrmcar> I know nothing about the Supertux build process, so...
[2015/11/21 14:35:49] <brmbrmcar> I want everything able to be made from a lisp definition file.

[2015/11/22 06:15:25] <Tobbi> I need to clear the snow...

[2015/11/22 06:15:38] <Tobbi> You're required to do so.
[2015/11/22 06:15:42] <Tobbi> according to law.
[2015/11/22 06:16:03] <brmbrmcar> Naughty law!
[2015/11/22 06:17:34] <Tobbi> Not really...
[2015/11/22 06:17:42] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/22 06:17:52] <brmbrmcar> It is a pain though.
[2015/11/22 06:18:12] <brmbrmcar> And I like snow because its cold.
[2015/11/22 06:18:35] <Hume2> I like snow because of SuperTux :D
[2015/11/22 06:19:01] <brmbrmcar> :D

[2015/11/22 06:23:26] <Tobbi> Basically, all issues that were reported in the last year and which giby didn't address...
[2015/11/22 06:26:32] <Tobbi> You shouldn't need to re-translate stuff...You can just click the appropriate thing from the translation memory.

[2015/11/22 06:36:45] <brmbrmcar> I haven't a clue.
[2015/11/22 06:37:53] <grumbel> Can anybody reproduce the issue of supertux getting really really slow in --debug mode?
[2015/11/22 06:38:03] <Karkus> grumbel: Let me try
[2015/11/22 06:38:04] <grumbel> Doesn't happen always, but like every second or third restart of the game
[2015/11/22 06:38:30] <grumbel> It's only slow for 30sec or so, then it goes back to normal
[2015/11/22 06:38:50] <grumbel> might be an AMD graphics driver issue, but could also be something completely different
[2015/11/22 06:39:06] <Karkus> It's fairly slow anyway, because of these -> https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/labels/involves%3Aperformance
[2015/11/22 06:39:13] <brmbrmcar> No, but I do get the same issue sometimes starting normally.
[2015/11/22 06:42:07] <grumbel> any objections against merging feature/gtest into master?
[2015/11/22 06:42:57] <Karkus> grumbel: I've tried it quite a few times, and I haven't noticed any difference whatsoever

[2015/11/22 06:50:42] <Tobbi> So it shouldn't have any impact on the final game at all.
[2015/11/22 06:50:44] <Tobbi> Thus can be merged.

[2015/11/22 06:53:25] <Tobbi> Not enough to be clearing...
[2015/11/22 06:53:29] <Tobbi> apparently.
[2015/11/22 06:54:00] <brmbrmcar> So I'm not missing out.
[2015/11/22 06:54:35] <Tobbi> grumbel: Couldn't you only build a static library in case people actively choose to configure with -DTest?

[2015/11/22 06:55:24] <grumbel> not really worth the effort, static library doesn't add much extra time, it's just scooping up all the .o files into an lib*.a

[2015/11/22 10:12:15] <Tobbi> leyyin: So, I even had to exclude squirrel library from coverity because that part is just a mess.
[2015/11/22 10:12:29] <Tobbi> leyyin: People never want to see my code. They don't understand it anyway :D

[2015/11/22 10:13:50] <Tobbi> Why the hell didn't that trigger a coverity analysis? grr
[2015/11/22 10:13:54] <leyyin> Tobbi, you should put your university code on github ;)
[2015/11/22 10:14:01] <Tobbi> leyyin: Part of it is.
[2015/11/22 10:15:16] <Tobbi> leyyin: My bachelor project https://github.com/tobbi/projectgenerator

[2015/11/22 10:16:01] <Tobbi> leyyin: No. :P
[2015/11/22 10:16:12] <Tobbi> leyyin: Having this on github was just not that important to me.
[2015/11/22 10:16:23] <Tobbi> I mean: I didn't really care about perfectionism anyway.
[2015/11/22 10:16:35] <Tobbi> My thesis was 119 pages. I had no way to change that.

[2015/11/22 10:19:59] <leyyin> Tobbi, when you have great power you also have great responsibility :P
[2015/11/22 10:19:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: I have achieved a new low in relationships with society. People in my neighborhood ignore me even when I greet them :D
[2015/11/22 10:21:07] <leyyin> Tobbi, did that happen multiple times?
[2015/11/22 10:21:26] <Tobbi> leyyin: Oh, I told you already, didn't I? :D
[2015/11/22 10:21:30] <Tobbi> But it happens sometimes...
[2015/11/22 10:21:45] <leyyin> sometimes they do not hear...
[2015/11/22 10:21:55] <leyyin> just saying, I do not think they do it on purpose
[2015/11/22 10:22:11] <Tobbi> leyyin: Believe me, they do.
[2015/11/22 10:22:36] <Tobbi> leyyin: I'm really unpopular with the neighbours...
[2015/11/22 10:22:45] <leyyin> Tobbi, ask why, then fix it
[2015/11/22 10:22:54] <Tobbi> Mainly for not caring about my garden, keeping the christmas lights out even when its not christmas...
[2015/11/22 10:22:55] <Tobbi> >D
[2015/11/22 10:22:56] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/22 10:23:01] <Tobbi> And staying isolated.
[2015/11/22 10:23:10] <leyyin> Tobbi, you suck as a neighour then :P

[2015/11/22 10:23:24] <Tobbi> leyyin: I know. But I don't want to be dictated what to do by society...
[2015/11/22 10:23:27] <Tobbi> Thus, I do these things.
[2015/11/22 10:23:32] <leyyin> get your shit together
[2015/11/22 10:23:34] <leyyin> Tobbi, edgy
[2015/11/22 10:24:09] <Tobbi> leyyin: Not really... I believe people look down on me. i'm not willing to contribute to that by complying with society...
[2015/11/22 10:24:27] <leyyin> does not make any sense :D
[2015/11/22 10:24:42] <Karkus> I don't think either of you have OCD, by the way
[2015/11/22 10:25:02] <leyyin> not sure if compliment or insult, hmm.....
[2015/11/22 10:25:16] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes it does. If I comply with society, that means that people think I comply... If they accept me the way I am, I might even get to do the garden.
[2015/11/22 10:25:31] <Tobbi> But since they don't accept me as an equal, even though I don't do my garden, I don't do my garden.
[2015/11/22 10:25:40] <leyyin> does not make any sense
[2015/11/22 10:25:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: I am not so sure about the OCD part...I had OCD issues in the past.
[2015/11/22 10:25:45] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes it does.

[2015/11/22 10:25:51] <leyyin> for me it does not
[2015/11/22 10:25:58] <Tobbi> hahaha
[2015/11/22 10:26:35] <Karkus> Tobbi: I'm just trying to point out perfectionism != OCD
[2015/11/22 10:26:43] <Tobbi> Karkus: right...
[2015/11/22 10:27:24] <Tobbi> leyyin: What I want is for people to see me as an individual and not as "just this anonymous member of society", and once they do that they realize that my garden is my business.
[2015/11/22 10:27:27] <Karkus> Tobbi: Because OCD is a far wider problem, it can include automatic thoughts, and other pretty horrible symptoms.
[2015/11/22 10:27:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: I have had OCD automatic thoughts before.
[2015/11/22 10:27:46] <Tobbi> So, I know how it feels like.
[2015/11/22 10:27:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: I see..
[2015/11/22 10:27:54] <leyyin> Tobbi, you should be more like me, not give a shit what other people think :P
[2015/11/22 10:28:04] <Tobbi> leyyin: It's harder than you think.
[2015/11/22 10:28:15] <Tobbi> Karkus: Did / doyou? have OCD I mean?
[2015/11/22 10:28:45] <leyyin> Tobbi, you know in murica it's illegal to not mow your lawn
[2015/11/22 10:28:54] <Tobbi> leyyin: what? :D

[2015/11/22 10:30:07] <Tobbi> leyyin: haha, I'd get fined constantly...
[2015/11/22 10:30:09] <leyyin> because you are lowering the house pricing in that area
[2015/11/22 10:30:21] <leyyin> Tobbi, then they will drive you out with police....
[2015/11/22 10:30:28] <Tobbi> leyyin: With that many students in my hometown, everyone should be glad.
[2015/11/22 10:32:55] <Tobbi> leyyin: By the way: The scammers claiming to be microsoft don't call me anymore... :-( I fucked with them too extensively...
[2015/11/22 10:33:35] <Tobbi> Unless they call next month...but I doubt they'll do it.
[2015/11/22 10:33:36] <leyyin> cool scammers :D

[2015/11/22 10:34:30] <leyyin> I run arch on my small laptop :P
[2015/11/22 10:34:46] <leyyin> I did not get audio to work yet thought
[2015/11/22 10:35:08] <Tobbi> leyyin: Well, I didn't understand that indian random person (indians all sound the same, no matter whether guy or girl or horse) and they forwarded me to their manager...And once I couldn't understand that person either, after some time of pretending to understand, I was like "Okay, this time I wanted to scam you for a change"...
[2015/11/22 10:35:15] <head8debian> leyyin: *most* people wont get fined for not mowing their lawns. Its mainly in more expensive areas that you can.
[2015/11/22 10:35:16] <Tobbi> And I believe that made them stop.

[2015/11/22 10:37:03] <Tobbi> not sure if they are...
[2015/11/22 10:37:07] <Tobbi> maybe they're.
[2015/11/22 10:37:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: I won't email the OpenAL team until i hear back from someone else with the same issue.
[2015/11/22 10:37:29] <leyyin> head8debian, it's your driver :P
[2015/11/22 10:37:29] <Tobbi> head8debian: You can use a different email address...a temporary forwarding address.

[2015/11/22 10:41:08] <grumbel> Is the console in SuperTux working for anybody?
[2015/11/22 10:41:18] <Tobbi> grumbel: It has always been working for me.
[2015/11/22 10:41:24] <Tobbi> grumbel: Please check what mt said above.
[2015/11/22 10:41:27] <head8debian> mt: Does the git version of supertux have audio with the latest version of OpenAL on your system?
[2015/11/22 10:41:38] <head8debian> Console in supertux...?
[2015/11/22 10:41:57] <mt> what the packaging scripts are basically doing is `cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DINSTALL_SUBDIR_BIN=bin; make; make DESTDIR="${pkgdir}/" install`, then tar up $pkgdir and use it as package
[2015/11/22 10:42:10] <mt> that package then doesn't include the binary
[2015/11/22 10:42:11] <Tobbi> Mathnerd314: I like the parody more than the original.
[2015/11/22 10:42:15] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/11/22 10:43:21] <head8debian> mt: Your building from a PKGBUILD?
[2015/11/22 10:43:30] <mt> yes
[2015/11/22 10:43:49] <Tobbi> grumbel: Check the shortcut for the console.
[2015/11/22 10:43:52] <Tobbi> And change it..
[2015/11/22 10:44:02] <Tobbi> I had to change the shortcut as well.
[2015/11/22 10:44:23] <head8debian> mt: Im building directly from git.
[2015/11/22 10:44:36] <head8debian> Not using a PKGBUILD.
[2015/11/22 10:44:43] <mt> well, the pkgbuild takes the git repo and uses it
[2015/11/22 10:44:55] <mt> because the Arch way
[2015/11/22 10:45:32] <mt> better write a pkgbuild than install something to some place and not knowing what it installs to what place

[2015/11/22 10:48:00] <mt> head8debian: music works, but it says `connect(2) call to /dev/shm/jack-1000/default/jack_0 failed (err=No such file or directory)` on startup
[2015/11/22 10:48:29] <Tobbi> grumbel: The console showing up and disappearing is intended behaviour.
[2015/11/22 10:48:36] <Tobbi> That's just for showing messages.
[2015/11/22 10:48:58] <Tobbi> grumbel: Did you try setting the console key to one of the F1..F12 keys?
[2015/11/22 10:49:02] <Tobbi> If not, try it.

[2015/11/22 11:10:03] <head8debian> mt: Yep, fixed it.
[2015/11/22 11:11:14] <grumbel> Any objections against removing the (console #t) flag in config along with --noconsole/--console options? It's all pretty redundant given that there is a developer mode which does much the same
[2015/11/22 11:11:30] <Tobbi> Okay, fine...
[2015/11/22 11:12:00] <head8debian> mt: Well, it fixes the issue for Supertux, but not other programs that were affected.
[2015/11/22 11:13:42] <Tobbi> But SuperTux is the most important...
[2015/11/22 11:14:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: :p
[2015/11/22 11:14:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: I think minetest is a bigger program. :)
[2015/11/22 11:14:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: Exactly! SuperTux stayed slim throughout the years.

[2015/11/22 12:53:59] <head8debian> Tobbi: Do we want all the passwords to be the same also?
[2015/11/22 12:54:11] <Tobbi> head8debian: I set a new password for the twitter handle.
[2015/11/22 12:54:18] <Tobbi> One that I'll have difficulties to remember.
[2015/11/22 12:54:20] <head8debian> I have set up 100 key passwords for our google account and email.
[2015/11/22 12:54:27] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/22 12:54:37] <head8debian> Thanks Keepassx.
[2015/11/22 12:55:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, who should i msg the info to. It *should* be safe to PM the info. Otherwise i can try to encrypt with GPG.
[2015/11/22 12:55:15] <brmbrmcar> 100 different ones or a 100 character long one?
[2015/11/22 12:55:23] <Tobbi> head8debian: uhm...one moment.
[2015/11/22 12:55:25] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: 100 character long.
[2015/11/22 12:55:39] <brmbrmcar> Why that secure?
[2015/11/22 12:56:23] <Tobbi> Unfortunately, I don't have any working GPG keys...
[2015/11/22 12:56:32] <Karkus> head8debian: Now that's too far. Most of my passwords are at least 15 chars, but thats enough
[2015/11/22 12:56:33] <brmbrmcar> There is no point. If someone really wanted to know the password they could hack into the sending of it.
[2015/11/22 12:56:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: Can you set up forwarding?
[2015/11/22 12:56:56] <brmbrmcar> I like long passwords though. :D
[2015/11/22 12:56:59] <Tobbi> As in: Forward all emails to that email address to my email?
[2015/11/22 12:57:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, what do you mean?
[2015/11/22 12:57:05] <Tobbi> I just explained.
[2015/11/22 12:57:06] <head8debian> I doubt it.
[2015/11/22 12:57:12] <Tobbi> really? Can't you try?
[2015/11/22 12:57:13] <head8debian> I can try though.

[2015/11/22 13:19:34] <Hume2> I think that the ideas should go to the forum.

[2015/11/22 13:20:50] <head8debian> We don't need a google+ page if we have a twitter page...
[2015/11/22 13:20:51] <Karkus> Hume2: It's difficult to know

[2015/11/22 13:21:49] <Karkus> Hume2: Where to put things.
[2015/11/22 13:22:02] <Karkus> The forum is less active than GitHub, for example
[2015/11/22 13:22:10] <Karkus> But I agree
[2015/11/22 13:22:31] <Hume2> At least the forum will be more active.
[2015/11/22 13:22:41] <Karkus> Hume2: Hopefully
[2015/11/22 13:23:15] <Karkus> Once we have a list of things there, it should be moved manually onto the wiki, and then slowly issues should be created for each thing.
[2015/11/22 13:25:20] <Hume2> That could work.
[2015/11/22 13:27:35] <Tobbi> We should get a verified handle on twitter.
[2015/11/22 13:27:42] <head8debian> Now we have a youtube page with no videos.
[2015/11/22 13:27:55] <brmbrmcar> Link for youtube page?

[2015/11/22 13:40:52] <mt> /me is actually an ACTION CTCP
[2015/11/22 13:40:58] * Hume2 didn't got too how /describe works.
[2015/11/22 13:41:10] <brmbrmcar> Try /describe brmbrmcar test. It might work online.
[2015/11/22 13:41:58] <Hume2> That doesn't work too: Unknown command DESCRIBE
[2015/11/22 13:42:26] <mt> /describe and /me are client specific
[2015/11/22 13:42:30] <mt> as is /ctcp
[2015/11/22 13:42:46] <mt> this is basically just a PRIVMSG

[2015/11/22 14:06:18] <Karkus> Cool fact: 1/5th of all supertux GitHub bugs are still open
[2015/11/22 14:06:40] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: So, do we close this, or what?
[2015/11/22 14:06:55] <Tobbi> that's not a lot.
[2015/11/22 14:06:57] <grumbel> Tobbi: supertux2 --debug, what file is it crashing on?
[2015/11/22 14:07:07] <brmbrmcar> You can, as it probably a glich with my crouton startup.
[2015/11/22 14:07:41] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: You are running ubuntu, correct?
[2015/11/22 14:08:01] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2015/11/22 14:08:15] <brmbrmcar> But I don't want the .deb or whatever.

[2015/11/22 14:08:40] <brmbrmcar> Yes, I tried.
[2015/11/22 14:09:06] <brmbrmcar> But 1. It doesn't work and 2. I don't actually want to install it.
[2015/11/22 14:09:26] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Then why are you asking to?
[2015/11/22 14:09:31] <head8debian> Its very easy.

[2015/11/22 14:30:36] <leyyin> which I can't do because it is my final year and I can't do an internship If I do no continue my studies
[2015/11/22 14:30:45] <Karkus> Were the people there nice, or arrogant?
[2015/11/22 14:30:55] <leyyin> and full time, this answers -> http://www.vladalexandruionescu.com/2015/09/dear-tech-giants-if-you-love-someone.html

[2015/11/22 14:31:26] <Karkus> leyyin: I know...
[2015/11/22 14:31:42] <leyyin> but I do not know to work for a corporation ;)

[2015/11/22 14:33:22] <leyyin> Karkus, meaning?
[2015/11/22 14:33:56] <Karkus> leyyin: What would you do instead of work for a corporation
[2015/11/22 14:34:04] <leyyin> work for yourself....
[2015/11/22 14:34:08] <leyyin> work on your own project
[2015/11/22 14:34:10] <leyyin> indie dev
[2015/11/22 14:34:26] <leyyin> start your own company, etc
[2015/11/22 14:34:37] <Karkus> leyyin: Ah, okay.
[2015/11/22 14:34:55] <leyyin> be at the top of the food chain :P
[2015/11/22 14:35:00] <leyyin> not slave in a corporation :P

[2015/11/22 14:35:14] <Karkus> I typed slave before you did.
[2015/11/22 14:35:34] <leyyin> well they pay you a lot
[2015/11/22 14:36:06] <Karkus> leyyin: But you can't escape the leash to go buy anything
[2015/11/22 14:36:15] <leyyin> meaning?
[2015/11/22 14:36:22] <leyyin> you can do whatever you like with your money....
[2015/11/22 14:36:53] <Karkus> leyyin: I mean, metaphorically. They make you work very hard, don't they?
[2015/11/22 14:37:07] <leyyin> you work as much as you want ;)
[2015/11/22 14:37:16] <leyyin> they do not track you in the office
[2015/11/22 14:37:25] <leyyin> no punch cards, etc
[2015/11/22 14:37:41] <Karkus> Hmmm
[2015/11/22 14:37:57] <Karkus> Can you work from home?
[2015/11/22 14:38:04] <leyyin> on some days yes
[2015/11/22 14:38:07] <leyyin> if there is a reason
[2015/11/22 14:38:12] <leyyin> you are sick, etc
[2015/11/22 14:38:16] <Karkus> leyyin: Do you get 20% time?
[2015/11/22 14:38:24] <leyyin> well, idk :P
[2015/11/22 14:38:32] <leyyin> some people said that 20% is still alive, others said nope
[2015/11/22 14:38:35] <leyyin> so I am not sure
[2015/11/22 14:38:48] <Karkus> leyyin: I don't understand...
[2015/11/22 14:38:50] <leyyin> Karkus, do you want to work for Google?
[2015/11/22 14:39:12] <brmbrmcar> I hate Google.
[2015/11/22 14:39:13] <Karkus> leyyin: I have considered trying to aim for it, but I've had doubts
[2015/11/22 14:39:34] <Karkus> leyyin: This is why I'm speaking to you :D
[2015/11/22 14:39:47] <leyyin> Karkus, are you a student?
[2015/11/22 14:39:58] <Karkus> But this isn't necessarily about Google, just in general

[2015/11/22 14:40:59] <brmbrmcar> You know what kind of job I want...

[2015/11/22 14:42:36] <leyyin> you just want to want it bad enough
[2015/11/22 14:42:38] <leyyin> and work hard
[2015/11/22 14:42:49] <brmbrmcar> I'll get Chrome OS to run all file types, hey? No chance.
[2015/11/22 14:42:52] <Tobbi> leyyin: That's how I got my Mozilla internship.
[2015/11/22 14:43:05] <leyyin> Tobbi, by being a slacker? :P
[2015/11/22 14:43:06] <brmbrmcar> I am not considering it at this stage.
[2015/11/22 14:43:34] <Tobbi> leyyin: No, I contributed constantly for around 3 years or so.
[2015/11/22 14:43:42] <Karkus> Also, does (open source = insecure)?
[2015/11/22 14:44:16] <brmbrmcar> Tobbi: But you never implemented MNG support.
[2015/11/22 14:44:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: Worked your metaphorical socks off
[2015/11/22 14:44:35] <Tobbi> Karkus: You're aware of the fact that open source means more people take a look at the code, right?
[2015/11/22 14:44:40] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes, I did.
[2015/11/22 14:44:46] <leyyin> well my dream would be to work on an open source product and be paid for it :P
[2015/11/22 14:44:55] <Karkus> Tobbi: I reckon I'm aware of that
[2015/11/22 14:44:59] <Tobbi> leyyin: Aka Mozilla.
[2015/11/22 14:45:07] <Karkus> leyyin: This exists
[2015/11/22 14:45:15] <Karkus> Android?
[2015/11/22 14:45:21] <leyyin> Tobbi, mozilla is going down the shit drain
[2015/11/22 14:45:41] <brmbrmcar> Android is not open source! But it is free!
[2015/11/22 14:45:43] <leyyin> I still read the new glassdoor reviews :P
[2015/11/22 14:45:54] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, check your facts mate ;)
[2015/11/22 14:46:00] <Tobbi> leyyin: there are new?
[2015/11/22 14:46:21] <leyyin> Karkus, well, they develop their new android version closed at first, but they release a new version down and there
[2015/11/22 14:46:26] <leyyin> under an open source license
[2015/11/22 14:46:27] <brmbrmcar> Well, show me the source for Android.
[2015/11/22 14:46:49] <Karkus> leyyin: But if you've got it on your phone, you can get the code.
[2015/11/22 14:46:49] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, heard of custom roms?
[2015/11/22 14:46:50] <brmbrmcar> And, if people pay for it, they get a nasty bonus.
[2015/11/22 14:46:57] <brmbrmcar> Yeah
[2015/11/22 14:47:09] * Tobbi opens up glassdoor.com
[2015/11/22 14:47:11] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, how do they do it, the custom roms, without the source code?
[2015/11/22 14:47:20] <brmbrmcar> Er...
[2015/11/22 14:47:28] <brmbrmcar> But then there is no cost!
[2015/11/22 14:47:35] <brmbrmcar> That is a different thing!
[2015/11/22 14:47:38] <leyyin> what?

[2015/11/22 14:48:56] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Android must be open source, as it is based off Linux
[2015/11/22 14:49:12] <leyyin> Karkus, *the kernel must be open source
[2015/11/22 14:49:17] <Karkus> The question is, does that mean that it is by definition less secure than iOS
[2015/11/22 14:49:27] <brmbrmcar> Where does the thing actually show the code?
[2015/11/22 14:49:27] <leyyin> any other part is not mandatory to be open source
[2015/11/22 14:49:30] <Tobbi> leyyin: The reviews are not *that* bad.
[2015/11/22 14:49:40] <Karkus> leyyin: It gets too complex for me.
[2015/11/22 14:49:50] <Karkus> All I know- GPL is infective
[2015/11/22 14:49:51] <Tobbi> I mean. There are 3 and 4 star reviews among them.

[2015/11/22 14:50:27] <Karkus> I have no idea how people work with code bases as huge as that...
[2015/11/22 14:50:28] <brmbrmcar> Ah. OK.
[2015/11/22 14:50:36] <brmbrmcar> Where do they charge then?

[2015/11/22 14:50:46] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, charge what?
[2015/11/22 14:50:56] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, are you as student?
[2015/11/22 14:51:43] <brmbrmcar> Like, what is the point of charging for it if someone can just git clone it?
[2015/11/22 14:51:51] <leyyin> ahem
[2015/11/22 14:51:59] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, who charges for android?
[2015/11/22 14:52:06] <Karkus> ...
[2015/11/22 14:52:07] <leyyin> android does not cost money....
[2015/11/22 14:52:27] <leyyin> I know a piece of software that is GPL (open source) and costs money

[2015/11/22 14:52:48] <Karkus> leyyin: ReTux :P
[2015/11/22 14:53:39] <brmbrmcar> Oh, Retux. I tried cracking it, but after about 200 minutes realised that it was going to take days, not minutes.
[2015/11/22 14:54:06] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Or years...
[2015/11/22 14:54:13] <brmbrmcar> Yes.

[2015/11/22 14:54:31] <Tobbi> Or millennia...
[2015/11/22 14:54:42] <brmbrmcar> I thought that it would dive in to the archive and just extract the thing.
[2015/11/22 14:54:44] <Tobbi> leyyin: Yes. Uses our assets, new code base.

[2015/11/23 09:00:57] <Tobbi> ah

[2015/11/23 09:08:52] <grumbel> The general syntax is '(section (name value) (name value) ...)'

[2015/11/23 09:10:53] <Tobbi> grumbel: Could we potentially have the parsing on a different thread?
[2015/11/23 09:12:21] <grumbel> Tobbi: not easily, Level loading right now triggers Tilemap loading that triggers OpenGL and OpenGL isn't happy when two threads access it
[2015/11/23 09:16:39] <grumbel> The initial worldmap loading could be spread across threads, as that isn't even using the regular Level loading

[2015/11/23 10:37:39] <Tobbi> head8debian: Which is?
[2015/11/23 10:37:56] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ask on the openal github page. :p
[2015/11/23 10:38:03] <Tobbi> *sigh*
[2015/11/23 10:38:15] <brmbrmcar> Always happens.
[2015/11/23 10:38:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: They did give us a solution to try though.
[2015/11/23 10:38:39] <Tobbi> ok
[2015/11/23 10:40:40] <brmbrmcar> But what was the solution?
[2015/11/23 10:52:38] <leper`> possible workaround is the better description
[2015/11/23 10:52:57] <leper`> (but yes, sounds (hehe) more like an upstream issue than a packaging issue)
[2015/11/23 10:55:57] <Tobbi> badum tss.
[2015/11/23 10:58:40] <leper`> Tobbi: Are you for hire? I might need sfx in a few other chans in case you are and you don't want to be paid in real money.
[2015/11/23 10:59:05] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 10:59:40] <head8debian> Tobbi: What does he want? I don't understand his english. :)
[2015/11/23 10:59:54] <head8debian> Tobbi: You may have gotten youself a job. :F
[2015/11/23 10:59:57] <head8debian> :D*
[2015/11/23 11:00:06] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's rude to talk about someone else in the third person.
[2015/11/23 11:00:18] <head8debian> It is?
[2015/11/23 11:00:22] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/23 11:00:26] <head8debian> Sorry leper`.
[2015/11/23 11:00:37] * head8debian is being nosey...
[2015/11/23 11:00:45] <brmbrmcar> Has head8debian been naughty?
[2015/11/23 11:00:51] * head8debian nods...
[2015/11/23 11:01:03] <head8debian> Hehe.
[2015/11/23 11:01:06] <leper`> head8debian: they also told me it's rude to talk about onself in the third person
[2015/11/23 11:01:29] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Saturday detention!
[2015/11/23 11:01:35] <head8debian> And why did "they" tell you that? :-)
[2015/11/23 11:01:41] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: From what?
[2015/11/23 11:02:04] <brmbrmcar> You being rude.
[2015/11/23 11:02:07] <Tobbi> Alright, that's enough.
[2015/11/23 11:02:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes it is.
[2015/11/23 11:02:34] <head8debian> Sorry.
[2015/11/23 11:02:52] <brmbrmcar> ACTION 
[2015/11/23 11:03:22] * head8debian goes back to my school...
[2015/11/23 11:03:34] <brmbrmcar> back to my?
[2015/11/23 11:03:35] * head8debian bangs his head on the table...
[2015/11/23 11:03:50] <leper`> head8debian: hm, someone should have asked them that before we got them decapitated
[2015/11/23 11:05:56] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why don't you bang someone / something else?
[2015/11/23 11:05:57] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/23 11:06:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: ...
[2015/11/23 11:06:39] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:07:37] <leper`> Tobbi: You're having a blast, aren't you?
[2015/11/23 11:07:50] <Tobbi> leper`: What?
[2015/11/23 11:08:15] <leper`> and I thought you wanted to continue with the drum puns
[2015/11/23 11:08:19] <head8debian> leper`: Haha. He always does teasing me. :)
[2015/11/23 11:08:42] <leper`> you mean he's beating the head8drum again?
[2015/11/23 11:08:51] <head8debian> He sure is not the young grouch i first thought he was. :p
[2015/11/23 11:09:15] <leper`> I guess he showed you some id :P
[2015/11/23 11:09:43] <head8debian> Tobbi: Any chocolate show up from that guy yet? :D
[2015/11/23 11:09:44] <Tobbi> leper`: Oh!
[2015/11/23 11:09:47] <Tobbi> head8debian: Nope.
[2015/11/23 11:09:50] <head8debian> :(
[2015/11/23 11:09:56] <head8debian> Slow air mail.
[2015/11/23 11:09:58] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/23 11:10:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh c'mon.
[2015/11/23 11:10:11] <Tobbi> I should've never given him my mailing address...
[2015/11/23 11:10:23] <brmbrmcar> Air mail?
[2015/11/23 11:10:24] <head8debian> Tobbi: Im joking!
[2015/11/23 11:10:28] <leper`> I'd have sent you a picture of chocolate
[2015/11/23 11:10:30] <Tobbi> I know, it's right.
[2015/11/23 11:12:05] <brmbrmcar> Where are the links to the Supertux social stuff you did yesterday?
[2015/11/23 11:13:03] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: https://twitter.com/supertux_team
[2015/11/23 11:13:51] <brmbrmcar> And...
[2015/11/23 11:14:56] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: And what? Thats it ATM.
[2015/11/23 11:15:18] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: If you get us some live footage of you playing supertux i will make a video.
[2015/11/23 11:15:35] <head8debian> I dont have enough GPU power to record and play.
[2015/11/23 11:15:48] @ Quit: brmbrmcar: Quit: Lost terminal
[2015/11/23 11:15:50] <leper`> head8debian: guess I'll get someone to make out twitter account follow yours or something
[2015/11/23 11:15:52] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/11/23 11:16:22] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why did you call brmbrmcar an ATM?
[2015/11/23 11:16:27] <Tobbi> He doesn't look like an ATM.
[2015/11/23 11:16:29] <Tobbi> Not by far.
[2015/11/23 11:16:36] <Tobbi> Actually, guess I cannot know that.
[2015/11/23 11:17:11] <leper`> Tobbi: but if he looks like an ATM that might help with getting money
[2015/11/23 11:17:19] <Tobbi> leper`: Or losing it again...
[2015/11/23 11:17:21] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:17:41] <head8debian> o_O
[2015/11/23 11:17:52] <leper`> you do use the ATM wrong in that case
[2015/11/23 11:18:02] <Tobbi> :D

[2015/11/23 11:19:15] <brmbrmcar> IMAGINE IF IT WAS WINDIWS!
[2015/11/23 11:19:32] <leper`> WHAT?
[2015/11/23 11:19:50] <brmbrmcar> Twitter is evil.
[2015/11/23 11:20:11] <leper`> and?
[2015/11/23 11:20:30] <brmbrmcar> It overloaded crouton.
[2015/11/23 11:20:55] <leper`> whatever that is
[2015/11/23 11:20:56] <brmbrmcar> That page was more than id
[2015/11/23 11:21:04] <brmbrmcar> is left in my SSD.
[2015/11/23 11:21:08] <head8debian> leper`: Its a tasty treat for a salad.
[2015/11/23 11:21:22] <Tobbi> Indeed.
[2015/11/23 11:21:28] <Tobbi> I like Croutons  as well.
[2015/11/23 11:21:30] <head8debian> :D
[2015/11/23 11:21:55] <leper`> head8debian: so bacon?
[2015/11/23 11:22:01] <brmbrmcar> I mean the thing for Chromebooks.
[2015/11/23 11:22:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: We have gotten about 6 inches of snow. o_O And its makign a huge mess since its not freezing out.
[2015/11/23 11:22:19] <brmbrmcar> I want an external HDD.
[2015/11/23 11:22:27] <head8debian> leper`: On salad? Meh.
[2015/11/23 11:22:34] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: You are so lucky!
[2015/11/23 11:22:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: Really? We haven't gotten any more snow.
[2015/11/23 11:22:42] <leper`> you don't have to have the salad
[2015/11/23 11:22:49] <head8debian> leper`: On brocolli salad, yum! :D
[2015/11/23 11:22:51] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Could it be that you're slightly autistic?
[2015/11/23 11:23:06] <head8debian> I hate snow. I have to work in it. :D
[2015/11/23 11:23:07] <brmbrmcar> What?
[2015/11/23 11:23:17] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Know what autism is?
[2015/11/23 11:23:32] <Tobbi> if not, never mind.
[2015/11/23 11:23:39] <leper`> (there is some car - auto pun hidden in there)
[2015/11/23 11:23:44] <brmbrmcar> yeah.
[2015/11/23 11:24:04] <Tobbi> leper`: hah. I didn't even think about that.
[2015/11/23 11:24:18] <leper`> I know, that's why I'm here
[2015/11/23 11:28:15] <head8debian> Tobbi: [Ar] 4d9. :D
[2015/11/23 11:28:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: What? Argon?
[2015/11/23 11:28:34] <Tobbi> Chess?
[2015/11/23 11:28:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: If you give me you address i may give you a pack of resistors for christmas. :D
[2015/11/23 11:28:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: Isnt that Copper?
[2015/11/23 11:29:09] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why would I want resistors?
[2015/11/23 11:29:21] <leper`> to join the resistance
[2015/11/23 11:29:31] <Tobbi> leper`: Bad pun...
[2015/11/23 11:29:39] <leper`> I've got worse
[2015/11/23 11:29:42] <head8debian> Tobbi: How about a dog collar? :D
[2015/11/23 11:29:59] <Tobbi> head8debian: I am not into SM
[2015/11/23 11:30:00] <head8debian> Tobbi: How about some old SD RAM? :D I think i have a whopping 512mb lying around...
[2015/11/23 11:30:27] <head8debian> Nm. :)
[2015/11/23 11:30:31] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:30:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: What about chocolate?
[2015/11/23 11:30:38] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:30:53] <Tobbi> I'd prefer chocolate over anything else.
[2015/11/23 11:31:17] <head8debian> Tobbi: If i can ship chocolate from amazon, sure...
[2015/11/23 11:31:23] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:31:26] <Tobbi> Doubt it
[2015/11/23 11:31:31] <Tobbi> Besides, nah.
[2015/11/23 11:31:37] <head8debian> Hehe. :-)

[2015/11/23 11:31:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: How about a amazon gift card? :D
[2015/11/23 11:32:02] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/23 11:32:07] <Tobbi> head8debian: 1k USD?
[2015/11/23 11:32:22] <head8debian> Tobbi: Uhm, 5 USD?
[2015/11/23 11:32:36] <Tobbi> head8debian: Okay, compromise: (Google Security Bug Bounty) USD
[2015/11/23 11:33:07] <head8debian> Heh.
[2015/11/23 11:33:18] <Tobbi> head8debian: deal?
[2015/11/23 11:33:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: Nah. :D
[2015/11/23 11:34:00] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why not? Google Security Bug Bounty is almost cheap.
[2015/11/23 11:34:01] <Tobbi> Almost.

[2015/11/23 11:34:37] <Tobbi> head8debian: Want to have a look?

[2015/11/23 11:35:32] <Tobbi> head8debian: I don't go to choir any longer...
[2015/11/23 11:36:22] <brmbrmcar> Nice bit of dosh for hacking...

[2015/11/23 11:37:04] <head8debian> .
[2015/11/23 11:37:10] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I remember the days when Mozilla only paid 500 USD per security issues.
[2015/11/23 11:37:12] <Tobbi> Those days...
[2015/11/23 11:37:25] <head8debian> Tobbi: Money inflation...
[2015/11/23 11:37:31] <brmbrmcar> Ah, so I'd better hack Chrome.
[2015/11/23 11:37:31] <Tobbi> I could've gotten 15K instead of only 1.5K
[2015/11/23 11:37:33] <head8debian> Welcome Hume2 and Karkus!
[2015/11/23 11:37:44] <Tobbi> Or rather, 9K
[2015/11/23 11:37:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: you got anything at all?
[2015/11/23 11:37:48] <Hume2> Hi, head8debian.
[2015/11/23 11:38:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: I go 1.5K for 2 security bugs (+ helping QA 1)
[2015/11/23 11:38:28] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2015/11/23 11:38:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: They pay you if you fix a security issue?
[2015/11/23 11:38:40] <Tobbi> That was back in the old days...
[2015/11/23 11:38:44] <brmbrmcar> Like ReTux.
[2015/11/23 11:38:45] <Tobbi> Karkus: Fix??? No, find! :D
[2015/11/23 11:38:58] <Tobbi> Mozilla, that is.
[2015/11/23 11:39:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: O.o
[2015/11/23 11:39:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: But that was in 2010...or so...
[2015/11/23 11:39:19] <Tobbi> So 5 years ago...time flies.
[2015/11/23 11:39:32] <Karkus> When you're having fun?
[2015/11/23 11:39:44] <Tobbi> Karkus: somewhat :P
[2015/11/23 11:39:44] <brmbrmcar> If Microsoft gave out money for this they'd be bankrupt.
[2015/11/23 11:39:56] <Karkus> brmbrmcar: Yup
[2015/11/23 11:39:57] <Hume2> :DDDDDDD
[2015/11/23 11:40:13] <brmbrmcar> Same goes for Apple.
[2015/11/23 11:40:20] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: They do: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dn425055.aspx
[2015/11/23 11:40:53] <head8debian> Does this link work for anyone? http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/periodic_table/chemical_symbols.html
[2015/11/23 11:41:07] <Tobbi> Karkus: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2010-34/
[2015/11/23 11:41:25] <brmbrmcar> But they don't pay, they just use other free rewards.
[2015/11/23 11:41:32] <Tobbi> Also https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2009-45/
[2015/11/23 11:41:48] <brmbrmcar> Which is how Microsoft is still in business.
[2015/11/23 11:42:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: I can file a security report against microsoft! Windows is a complete vunerablity! There. :D
[2015/11/23 11:42:38] <Tobbi> head8debian: That will likely not work...
[2015/11/23 11:42:39] <Hume2> It's a spyware.
[2015/11/23 11:42:48] <head8debian> Tobbi: No, probably not.
[2015/11/23 11:42:51] <Tobbi> head8debian: Also, that's not a bug but intended behaviour.
[2015/11/23 11:42:55] <Tobbi> Thus, no $$$
[2015/11/23 11:43:21] <Hume2> Windows 10 is a spyware. If you had another spyware on your computer, you would solve it.
[2015/11/23 11:43:21] <Karkus> I will just say there's a virus on my computer, and show them the fix of formatting the partition
[2015/11/23 11:43:22] <brmbrmcar> Or alternatively I could actually hackWindows and they might not press charges when I tell them the issue.
[2015/11/23 11:43:44] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/23 11:44:16] <head8debian> Tobbi: Ok, WIndows 10 give me adware, so its bugged somehow. :D
[2015/11/23 11:44:28] <Tobbi> head8debian: Still intended behaviour
[2015/11/23 11:44:35] <head8debian> Tobbi: I know, i know. :)
[2015/11/23 11:44:52] <head8debian> Sorry Microsoft, im giving you a hard time.
[2015/11/23 11:45:02] <head8debian> Its hard to please everyone these days.
[2015/11/23 11:45:17] <Hume2> á	Ì²
[2015/11/23 11:45:29] <head8debian> You either have people who hate it or love it...
[2015/11/23 11:45:33] <brmbrmcar> Highlighter!
[2015/11/23 11:46:05] <Tobbi> Hume2: ?
[2015/11/23 11:46:17] <Karkus> head8debian: You're mixing up Marmite with Microsoft. Everyone hates Microsoft.
[2015/11/23 11:46:18] <Hume2> It was just an unicode test.
[2015/11/23 11:47:01] <head8debian> I don't hate Microsoft, i hate Windows. :)
[2015/11/23 11:47:12] <brmbrmcar> Everyone hates Microsoft! Apart from peple who don't!
[2015/11/23 11:47:20] <Hume2> Agreed.
[2015/11/23 11:47:21] <head8debian> I don't *hate* windows, just prefer not to use it.
[2015/11/23 11:47:25] <brmbrmcar> I hate Microsoft.
[2015/11/23 11:47:52] <brmbrmcar> All of Microsoft's money is fromindows.
[2015/11/23 11:47:52] <Hume2> Do never do any banking stuff on Windows 10.
[2015/11/23 11:48:10] <brmbrmcar> Never do any banking stuff onWindows.
[2015/11/23 11:48:34] <brmbrmcar> Any Windows.
[2015/11/23 11:48:37] <head8debian> And why not? Its still encrypted with HTTPS.
[2015/11/23 11:48:45] <Karkus> Key logger.
[2015/11/23 11:48:57] <Hume2> They send the keybord input.
[2015/11/23 11:49:17] <head8debian> Well try disabling Cortana...
[2015/11/23 11:49:22] <Karkus> Then again, Google does it too.
[2015/11/23 11:49:29] <Hume2> So you have to make a macro that changes the nubres, i.e. you press 1 and it writes 3.
[2015/11/23 11:49:31] <Karkus> With all of its products

[2015/11/23 11:50:38] <Tobbi> :P
[2015/11/23 11:50:52] <brmbrmcar> Actually, I think I have an idea for a fake terminal.
[2015/11/23 11:51:21] <brmbrmcar> Especially easy onWindows, although I did make my computer vunerable.
[2015/11/23 11:51:24] <head8debian> I prefer real terminals.
[2015/11/23 11:52:00] <brmbrmcar> No, you change the input, and display what you actually typed.
[2015/11/23 11:54:45] <brmbrmcar> Nice?
[2015/11/23 11:55:01] <head8debian> ...
[2015/11/23 11:55:13] <Hume2> Hmmm...
[2015/11/23 11:55:54] <leper`> head8debian: got you followed
[2015/11/23 11:56:00] <head8debian> leper`: What?
[2015/11/23 11:56:10] <leper`> meaning I told someone to follow you
[2015/11/23 11:56:50] <leper`> (that doesn't really answer your question, does it?)
[2015/11/23 11:56:53] <head8debian> leper`: Follow me on what?
[2015/11/23 11:57:12] <head8debian> leper`: I don't have a twitter account.
[2015/11/23 11:57:35] <head8debian> Good luck finding me on other social media sites.
[2015/11/23 11:57:44] <leper`> might have been a plural you ;-)
[2015/11/23 11:57:57] <leper`> (and you posted a twitter thingy above)
[2015/11/23 11:58:02] <Tobbi> head8debian: OUR TEAM twitter, ffs.
[2015/11/23 11:58:17] <head8debian> leper`: oh, OUR team? Its not *me*!
[2015/11/23 11:58:21] <brmbrmcar> Was there a Supertux Youtube account?
[2015/11/23 11:58:44] <head8debian> There is, but its empty.
[2015/11/23 11:59:28] <leper`> head8debian: yes, but some things also work for the plural case, and pinging roughly a third of the channel is rude
[2015/11/23 11:59:33] <brmbrmcar> Link for it?
[2015/11/23 11:59:38] <head8debian> leper`: :)
[2015/11/23 11:59:55] <leyyin> hmm leper` is here too
[2015/11/23 11:59:58] <leper`> but I guess I can try
[2015/11/23 12:00:03] <leyyin> can't go on freenode without this guy around :P
[2015/11/23 12:00:21] <leper`> Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: Tobbi: head8debian told me to ping everyone
[2015/11/23 12:00:29] <head8debian> leper`: I wish some people knew that its rude to ping half the channel...
[2015/11/23 12:00:34] <Tobbi> leper`: I don't suffer from MPD
[2015/11/23 12:00:41] <Hume2> Does anyone have an access to the SuperTux Youtube account?
[2015/11/23 12:00:48] <leper`> music player daemon?
[2015/11/23 12:00:52] <head8debian> Tobbi: Should we give hum access?
[2015/11/23 12:00:55] <brmbrmcar> Come on, a link for the YouTube page? Are you guys torturing me?
[2015/11/23 12:00:58] <head8debian> Hume2*
[2015/11/23 12:01:08] <Tobbi> head8debian: If he doesn't wreck it...
[2015/11/23 12:01:14] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: There isn o channel currently!
[2015/11/23 12:01:15] <leper`> leyyin: any channels you're on and I'm not?
[2015/11/23 12:01:18] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: You're torturing yourself enough.
[2015/11/23 12:01:20] <head8debian> Tobbi: Yes or no?
[2015/11/23 12:01:30] <Tobbi> head8debian: If he doesn't wreck it.
[2015/11/23 12:01:30] <brmbrmcar> Thank you, head8debian.
[2015/11/23 12:01:37] <head8debian> Tobbi: lOL. :)
[2015/11/23 12:01:39] <leper`> (also we do need Arthur_* in here)
[2015/11/23 12:01:52] <Tobbi> Hume2: Will you wreck the youtube channel?
[2015/11/23 12:02:08] <head8debian> Hume2: Do you promise to not wreck our accounts if i give you the info to log into them? :) And promise to not change the password?
[2015/11/23 12:02:14] <leyyin> leper`, #unknown-horizons ;)
[2015/11/23 12:02:39] <Hume2> Do I look like I wreck channels on purpose?
[2015/11/23 12:02:41] <Tobbi> head8debian: Plus, promise not to upload any videos of you dancing naked in the shower?
[2015/11/23 12:02:42] <brmbrmcar> What's evil about Hume2?
[2015/11/23 12:02:56] <Tobbi> Not even with a geo 3corners...
[2015/11/23 12:03:10] <leper`> leyyin: I take it that is the full list :P
[2015/11/23 12:03:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: That is the worst joke i have ever heard out of you.
[2015/11/23 12:03:22] <leper`> (haven't played that in ages, not really my kind of game)
[2015/11/23 12:03:24] <head8debian> Hume2: We are joking. :)
[2015/11/23 12:03:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: This is a geo three corner: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Set_square_Geodreieck.svg/2000px-Set_square_Geodreieck.svg.png

[2015/11/23 12:13:29] <brmbrmcar> What is the difference between giby and giby_the_kid?
[2015/11/23 12:13:29] <head8debian> Tobbi: No, Access.

[2015/11/23 12:13:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: :D
[2015/11/23 12:14:00] <brmbrmcar> Are they the same person?
[2015/11/23 12:14:13] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: YES!
[2015/11/23 12:14:31] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2015/11/23 12:14:42] <head8debian> usually head8debian and head8deb1an are the same person also!
[2015/11/23 12:15:38] <head8debian> One could be my goat, you never know. :D

[2015/11/23 12:19:28] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Oops.

[2015/11/23 12:20:12] <head8debian> Tobbi: giby has alot of open ports on his network. o_O
[2015/11/23 12:20:19] <Tobbi> ...
[2015/11/23 12:20:44] <head8debian> Tobbi: Whats your IP address so i can scan your network? :D
[2015/11/23 12:20:54] <Tobbi> head8debian: Do I want that?
[2015/11/23 12:20:56] <head8debian> Just keeping us safe. :D
[2015/11/23 12:21:06] <head8debian> You can scan mine all you want.
[2015/11/23 12:21:20] <Tobbi> head8debian: PM
[2015/11/23 12:21:21] <head8debian> Unless my ISP hacked in and set up port forwarding...
[2015/11/23 12:29:34] <brmbrmcar> I am conecting from home.
[2015/11/23 12:30:51] <head8debian> I wish i had my own IP address.
[2015/11/23 12:30:54] * head8debian cries...
[2015/11/23 12:31:01] <brmbrmcar> I want my own IP.
[2015/11/23 12:31:24] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: You probably can. I cannot.
[2015/11/23 12:31:31] <brmbrmcar> 4913.4913.4913.4913, but they would never allow one that long. :(
[2015/11/23 12:31:37] <brmbrmcar> How?
[2015/11/23 12:32:18] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Look it up.
[2015/11/23 12:32:30] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: 999.999.999 is the biggest IPV4 can handle.
[2015/11/23 12:32:34] <head8debian> Wait.
[2015/11/23 12:32:40] <head8debian> 999.999.999.999.
[2015/11/23 12:32:41] <head8debian> There.
[2015/11/23 12:32:53] <brmbrmcar> I just tried.
[2015/11/23 12:33:10] <brmbrmcar> But I cannot find anything part from my public IP.
[2015/11/23 12:33:40] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Don't worry about it. If you don't know what exactly you are doing you can open gateways for hackers to walk right in and hack your computer.
[2015/11/23 12:34:02] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: And you have no need for it.
[2015/11/23 12:34:17] <leper`> head8debian: Did you mean 255?
[2015/11/23 12:34:20] <Hume2> head8debian: No, biggest is 255.255.255.255.
[2015/11/23 12:34:29] <leper`> or are you working for CSI?
[2015/11/23 12:34:36] <brmbrmcar> And I can only change my settings through Chrome OS.
[2015/11/23 12:34:51] <Hume2> You can use IP changer.
[2015/11/23 12:35:30] <brmbrmcar> Yes, but that won't work for me.
[2015/11/23 12:35:42] <head8debian> I figured it was 255, but i thought 999 sounded cool. I was referencing to it being 3x4 digits long...
[2015/11/23 12:35:51] <leyyin> lemme write a visual basic program to trace your IP
[2015/11/23 12:35:53] <head8debian> 4x3. whatever.
[2015/11/23 12:36:06] <leyyin> *visual basic GUI
[2015/11/23 12:36:06] <leper`> wasn't that s/program/gui/?
[2015/11/23 12:36:07] <head8debian> Why not traceroute? :)
[2015/11/23 12:36:29] <leper`> head8debian: You're no real hacker if you do that
[2015/11/23 12:36:38] <head8debian> Im not a real hacker!
[2015/11/23 12:36:49] <leyyin> yes, head8debian you are on a list now, FBI most likely ;)
[2015/11/23 12:36:50] <head8debian> I just want to keep people out of *my* hair.
[2015/11/23 12:37:02] <head8debian> Huh?
[2015/11/23 12:37:04] <leper`> then go bald
[2015/11/23 12:37:06] <leper`> er bold!
[2015/11/23 12:37:36] <head8debian> lol.
[2015/11/23 12:37:48] <head8debian> I am, i have no IP address, and cannot get one. :D
[2015/11/23 12:37:56] <head8debian> I cannot even get a IPV6 tunnel...
[2015/11/23 12:38:12] <brmbrmcar> You have anIP address.
[2015/11/23 12:38:17] <brmbrmcar> Everyone does.
[2015/11/23 12:38:50] <leyyin> brmbrmcar, I don't
[2015/11/23 12:38:55] <leyyin> I live in the ether of the internet
[2015/11/23 12:38:59] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: No, not everyone.
[2015/11/23 12:39:03] <head8debian> leper`: ether?
[2015/11/23 12:39:05] <leper`> get some cheap vps? (then forward)
[2015/11/23 12:39:07] <head8debian> leyyin: ^
[2015/11/23 12:39:09] <leper`> lol
[2015/11/23 12:39:16] <head8debian> To much money. :D
[2015/11/23 12:39:17] <leper`> head8debian: something you can sniff
[2015/11/23 12:39:19] <brmbrmcar> So if you were to takeyour cloak off, what would it say?
[2015/11/23 12:39:19] <head8debian> :p
[2015/11/23 12:39:28] <mt> >Too much money
[2015/11/23 12:39:32] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: My ISPs IP address.
[2015/11/23 12:39:37] <mt> You can get VPSes for $15/year
[2015/11/23 12:39:41] <brmbrmcar> Like for me.
[2015/11/23 12:39:44] <head8debian> Its not too much money, but my parents won't let me.
[2015/11/23 12:40:04] <head8debian> My ISP feeds a couple hundred people on 2 IP addresses.
[2015/11/23 12:40:13] <brmbrmcar> Poor head8debian.
[2015/11/23 12:40:19] <leper`> mt: possibly less if you have some .edu email
[2015/11/23 12:40:21] <Hume2> I tried some on-line IP tracking stuff and any of them could trace me correctly.
[2015/11/23 12:41:18] <brmbrmcar> Not for me.
[2015/11/23 12:42:08] <head8debian> There are people who want a IP address and cannot have one and there are people who have one and dont have a clue that theyt have one.
[2015/11/23 12:42:24] @ Wuzzy joined channel #supertux
[2015/11/23 12:43:46] <brmbrmcar> Then steal one from the people who do not know. :D
[2015/11/23 12:44:17] <mt> but seriously - CGNAT and no IPv6
[2015/11/23 12:44:31] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: Thats kinda hard.
[2015/11/23 12:44:57] <brmbrmcar> I was joking.
[2015/11/23 12:45:32] <mt> >kinda hard - get some bgp peering w/o prefix filtering and announce a route
[2015/11/23 12:46:07] <head8debian> mt: What?
[2015/11/23 12:46:08] <brmbrmcar> How do you get whatever IP you eant for free?
[2015/11/23 12:46:17] <head8debian> brmbrmcar: You don't.
[2015/11/23 12:46:18] <brmbrmcar> Without any software?
[2015/11/23 12:46:28] * brmbrmcar cries
[2015/11/23 12:47:12] @ Quit: Tobbi: Remote host closed the connection
[2015/11/23 12:47:57] <mt> well
[2015/11/23 12:48:03] <mt> you can leak a BGP route
[2015/11/23 12:48:58] <head8debian> mt: I think i can survive with it the way it is. :)
[2015/11/23 12:49:07] <head8debian> I have no one's IP address to use anyways.
[2015/11/23 12:49:20] <head8debian> All my relatives use the same ISP.
[2015/11/23 12:50:10] <mt> when you leak a route you usually do that without the owner's permission
[2015/11/23 12:50:11] <brmbrmcar> That is annoying.
[2015/11/23 12:50:36] <head8debian> mt: Ok, then im *NOT* doing it.
[2015/11/23 12:50:38] <head8debian> :)
[2015/11/23 12:51:05] <mt> you can't anyway without a BGP session
[2015/11/23 12:51:53] <mt> and there's ROA to prevent bad announcements as well
[2015/11/23 12:52:11] <mt> however, it can happen that ISPs leak routes they're not supposed to announce
[2015/11/23 12:52:30] <mt> and even if that's a one-person ISP it can actually take down entire Google
[2015/11/23 12:52:45] <brmbrmcar> Awesome!
[2015/11/23 12:52:52] <brmbrmcar> Can you do that?
[2015/11/23 12:53:03] <leper`> head8debian: in case you have an .edu email https://education.github.com/pack and the digitalocean thing might help you for some time
[2015/11/23 12:53:12] <mt> I don't have any BGP sessions in the real internet
[2015/11/23 12:53:22] <head8debian> leper`: .edu email?
[2015/11/23 12:53:25] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2015/11/23 12:53:33] <leper`> as in school
[2015/11/23 12:53:43] <head8debian> No i don't have one.
[2015/11/23 12:53:44] <mt> leper`: you don't even need an .edu address if you can send them a copy of your student ID iirc
[2015/11/23 12:53:54] <leper`> never got that far
[2015/11/23 12:54:04] <head8debian> Whats a student id?
[2015/11/23 12:54:11] <brmbrmcar> What is a Student ID?
[2015/11/23 12:54:25] <brmbrmcar> oops
[2015/11/23 12:54:42] <mt> "Please upload an image of your school ID, academic transcript, or other proof of affiliation. Please make sure dates are visible, verifying your status as a current student."
[2015/11/23 12:55:08] <brmbrmcar> I have none of that.
[2015/11/23 12:55:24] <head8debian> nm...
[2015/11/23 12:55:25] <mt> that shows up if you select "I don't have a school-issued email"
[2015/11/23 12:56:21] <mt> and - any high school, university, college, etc should actually be able to provide you a 'proof of affiliation', as in a proof that you visit a state-recognized school
[2015/11/23 12:56:36] <head8debian> mt: Im Homeschooled.
[2015/11/23 12:57:21] <mt> americans...
[2015/11/23 12:57:24] <leyyin> :D
[2015/11/23 12:57:38] <brmbrmcar> head8debian: Is that good?
[2015/11/23 12:58:05] <mt> head8debian: but don't you have to write tests or so that proof that you actually get enough education?
[2015/11/23 12:59:48] <leyyin> I have no idea what you are talking about mt, all this network stuff :P, too low level
[2015/11/23 13:00:21] <leyyin> I never heard of BGP before, TIL

[2015/11/23 13:06:12] <head8debian> Sounds interesting.
[2015/11/23 13:07:06] <leyyin> well I am reading now on wikipedia
[2015/11/23 13:07:23] <mt> btw, @German-speaking people: http://www.daserste.de/information/reportage-dokumentation/citizenfour/index.html
[2015/11/23 13:07:41] <leyyin> seems weird that such a fundamental protocol is in the application layer ;)
[2015/11/23 13:09:01] <head8debian> The more studying i do on networking the less i realize i know...

[2015/11/23 13:09:58] <leyyin> it seems to me this is routing tables protocol for large networks :P
[2015/11/23 13:10:03] <head8debian> And we never noticed. :D
[2015/11/23 13:10:55] <Tobbi> mt: Ja, nee, das muss jetzt nicht sein. Hast du nicht irgendwas Ã¼ber Meerschweinchen, die sich durch Aufnahme von Smarties in eine Discokugel verwandelt haben oder so?

[2015/11/23 13:11:49] <leyyin> wtf?

[2015/11/23 13:14:23] <leyyin> I listen to google
[2015/11/23 13:14:35] <Tobbi> leyyin: And Google listens to you?

[2015/11/24 11:24:03] <Tobbi> maths22: How would you do that? The menu file in which the logo is defined doesn't support #if since it's not c++
[2015/11/24 11:24:03] <brmbrmcar> Is that a good idea?
[2015/11/24 11:24:32] <maths22> Tobbi: We use a CMake .in file
[2015/11/24 11:24:46] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It is a very good idea
[2015/11/24 11:25:01] <maths22> Duplicating code (or levels) is a bad idea because then only 1 will get changed

[2015/11/24 11:25:42] <maths22> Where is the logic for that?
[2015/11/24 11:25:42] <grumbel> ok
[2015/11/24 11:26:41] <maths22> brmbrmcar: I found the logic.  I'll think about it...
[2015/11/24 11:27:40] <brmbrmcar> maths22: OK.
[2015/11/24 11:27:54] <brmbrmcar> But we don't want it to bug up.
[2015/11/24 11:28:00] <maths22> brmbrmcar: of course
[2015/11/24 11:28:51] <brmbrmcar> So I probably wouldn't want to implement anything until after 0.4.0.
[2015/11/24 11:29:31] <Tobbi> ...unless those are really minor changes that won't break.
[2015/11/24 11:29:54] <brmbrmcar> But best be on the safe side.

[2015/11/24 14:33:59] <maths22> mt: Great
[2015/11/24 14:34:12] <maths22> I just figured having 3 copies of the main level is not a good idea
[2015/11/24 14:34:25] <maths22> It also meant that, during christmas time, the development logo would not be used
[2015/11/24 14:34:29] <brmbrmcar> the backgroundchange for the Christmas one?
[2015/11/24 14:34:37] <mt> Does the christmas hat also appear correctly if you're in development 'mode'?
[2015/11/24 14:34:56] <maths22> mt: Yes.  I tested it by changing my computer's date
[2015/11/24 14:35:11] <maths22> brmbrmcar: It is handled through an if clause in the menu.stl file
[2015/11/24 14:35:26] <Karkus> developer mode or debug build?
[2015/11/24 14:35:26] <brmbrmcar> Ah, it changes it all. :D
[2015/11/24 14:35:33] <mt> protip: rather make the code return true even if it's not christmas
[2015/11/24 14:35:51] <maths22> mt: I also did that
[2015/11/24 14:35:55] <mt> maybe we should even add an #ifdef for that for development purposes
[2015/11/24 14:36:06] <maths22> mt: why?
[2015/11/24 14:36:14] <maths22> Karkus: Sorry.  Debug build

[2015/11/24 14:36:25] <maths22> Why would developmer mode affect it at all
[2015/11/24 14:36:41] <maths22> mt: I get what you are saying.  I can add a CMake define for that

[2015/11/24 16:52:36] <Tobbi> thank you...
[2015/11/24 16:52:47] <maths22> I just created these issues so I don't forget in the future that I have this to work on
[2015/11/24 16:53:01] <Tobbi> :) Fine with me.
[2015/11/24 16:53:10] <Tobbi> And post-0.4.0 is a loooong way from today...
[2015/11/24 16:53:47] <maths22> Tobbi: I know, but 0.4.0 is a month from today (at least in theory)
[2015/11/24 16:53:52] <Tobbi> Yes.
[2015/11/24 16:54:04] <Tobbi> maths22: We'll make it. 20th of December...
[2015/11/24 16:54:26] <maths22> Tobbi: Also, once 0.4.0 releases, we should rename post-0.4.0 to future
[2015/11/24 16:54:33] <maths22> And we should create 0.4.1
[2015/11/24 16:55:10] <maths22> (future would be for things that don't yet have a specific target, like post-0.4.0 is now)
[2015/11/24 16:56:14] <Tobbi> yes.
[2015/11/24 16:56:21] <Tobbi> Sounds good.

[2015/11/24 16:58:40] <Tobbi> maths22: I know ;)
[2015/11/24 16:58:48] <Tobbi> I only read it once, though.
[2015/11/24 16:58:54] <maths22> Tobbi: I've only read it once too
[2015/11/24 16:59:04] <maths22> I really should read it again.  It was a lot of fun
[2015/11/24 16:59:13] <Tobbi> Yeah, same here.
[2015/11/24 16:59:21] <Tobbi> Maybe this time in English instead of German..
[2015/11/24 16:59:52] <head8debian> Ive heard things about it... good things...
[2015/11/24 16:59:58] <Tobbi> head8debian: Really?
[2015/11/24 17:00:04] <Tobbi> That's weird...

[2015/11/24 17:00:31] <Tobbi> Ah, okay.
[2015/11/24 17:00:53] <Tobbi> head8debian: It's a shame when you publicly critize a Christian for being hypocritical and he doesn't even reply...
[2015/11/24 17:00:58] <Tobbi> Know that feeling? :P
[2015/11/24 17:01:10] <head8debian> Tobbi: ?

[2015/11/24 17:01:46] <Tobbi> head8debian: So, there's this guy at Mozilla, whom I didn't like for being too Christian and too provocative...He wore a shirt with "Ask me about Jesus" at a public mozilla event on purpose.
[2015/11/24 17:01:55] <Tobbi> head8debian: sure, go ahead.

[2015/11/24 17:06:22] <Tobbi> We have no true account of what the Pilgrims ate that day, but from what we know we can safely guess that they feasted on Duck,  Rabbit, Lobsters,  roasted venison,  boiled turkey,  fish and stewed pumpkin. (what?)
[2015/11/24 17:06:36] <Tobbi> How do you know it if you don't have any accounts of it?
[2015/11/24 17:06:44] <Tobbi> I believe God liked to play counter strike
[2015/11/24 17:06:53] <Tobbi> It can never be read anywhere, though.
[2015/11/24 17:06:57] <head8debian> Tobbi: we can safely guess...

[2015/11/24 17:09:53] <Tobbi> Oh wait, you don't have those in America.
[2015/11/24 17:10:55] <head8debian> Tobbi: WHat do you think of it over all?
[2015/11/24 17:11:14] <Tobbi> head8debian: Oh, I didn't read it, I just checked for spelling mistakes.
[2015/11/24 17:11:44] <head8debian> :p

[2015/11/25 10:45:35] <grumbel> Has anybody ever used the support for multiple tilesets inside a level (i.e. the (tilesets ...) tag in .stl files)?
[2015/11/25 10:46:42] <grumbel> I feel tempted to remove it, as it turns the code into a bit of a mess
[2015/11/25 10:47:06] <grumbel> Could also be cleaner implemented inside the tileset instead of inside the level files
[2015/11/25 10:47:25] <brmbrmcar> It seems useful although I have nevr used it.
[2015/11/25 10:49:20] <grumbel> The only level that uses them is ./data/levels/test_old/tilesets.stl and that one doesn't even work
[2015/11/25 10:49:51] <brmbrmcar> I would use it, but I nothing about tilesets myself.
[2015/11/25 10:50:00] <brmbrmcar> Is it a major change?
[2015/11/25 10:50:12] <grumbel> no, just removal of dead code
[2015/11/25 10:50:36] <brmbrmcar> OK, then. Fine.
[2015/11/25 10:50:53] <brmbrmcar> Probably won't be needed now.
[2015/11/25 10:58:40] <grumbel> All the addons that use custom tilesets just define a new one right now instead of mixing them inside the .stl
[2015/11/25 10:59:19] <grumbel> and the editor doesn't support it either of course

[2015/11/25 12:47:49] <Hume2> Hello Tobbi. Could you describe me what you think I've done recently?
[2015/11/25 12:48:05] <Tobbi> Hume2: I don't know. I believe it was a mistake on my part.
[2015/11/25 12:48:29] <Hume2> Tobbi: see https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/commit/1f616741767b08e5c2db876f9484b327fcfd4cd9#diff-900335f1aa051f8b032208aa4a763c18L432
[2015/11/25 12:48:55] <Hume2> Tobbi: This is the code I've replaced with some more effective stuff.
[2015/11/25 12:48:57] <Tobbi> Hume2: Some tiles might need to have the COIN setting or something.
[2015/11/25 12:49:18] <Tobbi> I|m talking about // Marked for removal. Don't use
[2015/11/25 12:50:27] <Hume2> Tobbi: The COIN attribute is done another way.
[2015/11/25 12:50:34] <Tobbi> Sure?
[2015/11/25 12:50:37] <Tobbi> What about the others?

[2015/11/25 12:54:32] <Tobbi> I see?
[2015/11/25 12:55:07] <Hume2> Tobbi: In the case ob Brick, there was just a list of IDs which sprite is for which tiles.
[2015/11/25 12:55:14] <Tobbi> Okay...
[2015/11/25 12:55:41] <Hume2> Tobbi: All blocks with coin #t had the default con sprite.
[2015/11/25 12:55:55] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yes. but I am willing to change that.
[2015/11/25 12:56:02] <Tobbi> Aka, have the blue coin sprite for other levels...
[2015/11/25 12:56:12] <Tobbi> For the Yeti's Revenge levels.
[2015/11/25 12:56:23] <Hume2> Tobbi: Was this even possible?
[2015/11/25 12:56:31] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yes it worked the one time I tried.
[2015/11/25 12:56:41] <Hume2> I'll take a look on it's tileset.
[2015/11/25 12:57:09] <Hume2> I think it must be a powerup, but I'll take a look anyway.
[2015/11/25 12:58:19] <Hume2> Tobbi: Yet's Revenge doesn't use any custom tileset.
[2015/11/25 12:58:45] <Tobbi> Hume2: As long as I can still set (coin #t) on some object, I am fine.
[2015/11/25 12:59:24] <Hume2> Tobbi: What are you speaking about? (coin #t) on tiles?
[2015/11/25 12:59:31] <Hume2> ...or on objects?
[2015/11/25 12:59:34] <Tobbi> Hume2: Yeah, not sure...
[2015/11/25 12:59:39] <Tobbi> Not sure how I managed it last time.
[2015/11/25 13:01:33] <Hume2> Tobbi: I don't know any object with a "coin" boolean.
[2015/11/25 13:01:58] <Hume2> Tobbi: And when you apply it on a tile, it becomes the normal yellow coin.
[2015/11/25 13:02:22] <Hume2> That's the previous behaviour.
[2015/11/25 13:07:58] <Hume2> Tobbi: Blue coins work by the way.

[2015/11/25 13:17:49] <Tobbi> Hume2: I know that they work. But they don't show the coin animation...
[2015/11/25 13:17:53] <Tobbi> when you collect them.
[2015/11/25 13:18:02] <Hume2> hmmm...
[2015/11/25 13:18:03] <Tobbi> Thus, setting coin to #t, then setting a sprite file should work...
[2015/11/25 13:18:51] <Hume2> Tobbi: It's a powerup and I didn't affected powerups.
[2015/11/25 13:19:06] <Tobbi> Hume2: The coins are custom objects.
[2015/11/25 13:19:09] <Tobbi> I believe...
[2015/11/25 13:19:19] <Hume2> Tobbi: Let's see.
[2015/11/25 13:20:36] <Hume2> Tobbi: They are powerups.
[2015/11/25 13:20:46] <Tobbi> Okay, fine, so that's not affected.

[2015/11/25 14:15:48] <head8debian> "I am concerned about poultry and animals being given growth hormones". Arg... We don't give them growth hormones! We would be put out of buisiness if we did, but people don't realize that.
[2015/11/25 14:22:21] <head8debian> Also, the only reason we would(if ever) give them antibiotics is if they are not feeling well. Its illegal for us to sell animals with these antibiotics in their systems for up to 60 days after the last dose was given.
[2015/11/25 14:22:44] <head8debian> If any antibiotics are found in the meat the meat gets dumped and we get put out of buisiness, pretty much.

[2015/11/25 17:19:34] <Tobbi> :D
[2015/11/25 17:19:37] <Tobbi> I don't know...
[2015/11/25 17:19:42] <head8debian> If only i knew they would last and not burn anything down.
[2015/11/25 17:19:49] <head8debian> in the proccess.
[2015/11/25 17:20:40] <Tobbi> hmm...

[2015/11/25 17:21:10] <head8debian> I do have one chinese light in our barn that seems to be doing OK.
[2015/11/25 17:21:15] <Tobbi> head8debian: I have no idea what the hell you're trying to tell me.
[2015/11/25 17:21:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: For a electrical fixture to be legally put up over here they have to meet some pretty strict quality standards.
[2015/11/25 17:22:00] <Tobbi> really?
[2015/11/25 17:22:27] <Tobbi> You guys are weird, over there.
[2015/11/25 17:22:36] <head8debian> Tobbi: If not, well, the fixture has a bad reputation in our eyes.
[2015/11/25 17:22:45] <head8debian> Tobbi: Its mainly saftey.
[2015/11/25 17:22:51] <Tobbi> head8debian: Why do you put it in your eyes in the first place?
[2015/11/25 17:23:06] <head8debian> Plus we know that it will live up to certian standards.
[2015/11/25 17:23:09] <head8debian> Tobbi: :p
[2015/11/25 17:24:17] <Tobbi> head8debian: Anyway, if you want, you can fix the rest of the cppcheck issues.

[2015/11/25 17:24:31] <head8debian> Tobbi: And as a hope to be future electrician i have to stick up to the standards, which i sometimes with i don't always, making me feel guilty. :p
