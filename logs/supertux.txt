[2016/02/01 06:12:39] <snadge> i know this is offtopic.. but i just installed extreme tuxracer
[2016/02/01 06:12:51] <Tobbi> snadge: ...and?
[2016/02/01 06:13:01] <snadge> i cant help but feel that it sucks
[2016/02/01 06:13:07] <snadge> lol
[2016/02/01 06:13:23] <Tobbi> :D
[2016/02/01 06:13:30] <snadge> i've got hours of longevity out of supertux
[2016/02/01 06:13:45] <Tobbi> Oh, 0.7.0 was just release.
[2016/02/01 06:13:48] <Tobbi> d
[2016/02/01 06:13:50] <snadge> its challenging.. fun.. frustrating.. all of these things.. the contributed stuff can be very clever / creative
[2016/02/01 06:13:51] <Tobbi> of extreme tux racer.
[2016/02/01 06:14:09] <snadge> but extreme tux racer.. hmm.. i cant help but feel the mechanics of that game sucks
[2016/02/01 06:14:18] <snadge> and initial impressions are.. there is nothing fun about it
[2016/02/01 06:14:26] <Tobbi> :P Okay, I do get it...
[2016/02/01 06:14:35] <Tobbi> snadge: But SuperTux and the racer are completely different games.
[2016/02/01 06:14:51] <snadge> yeah.. i think i need to see a guide to etracer to see if im playing it wrong or something
[2016/02/01 06:14:56] <snadge> but i just find it very dorky to control
[2016/02/01 06:15:12] <Tobbi> snadge: I think that's the game, really. Last time I tried it was like that as well.
[2016/02/01 06:19:02] <Tobbi> Maybe I should contribute to that instead.
[2016/02/01 06:19:07] <Tobbi> It needs more work than we do.
[2016/02/01 06:19:56] <snadge> a 3d supertux would be better imho
[2016/02/01 06:20:09] <Tobbi> snadge: There is one...Supertux 3D on sourceforge.
[2016/02/01 06:20:09] <snadge> kinda like the 3d mario on the nintendo ds

[2016/02/01 12:05:10] <brmbrmcar> What happened to Notifico?
[2016/02/01 12:05:17] <mt> it's been replaced

[2016/02/01 12:09:40] <mt> what's wrong with it?
[2016/02/01 12:09:50] <brmbrmcar> I just don't like it.
[2016/02/01 12:10:02] <mt> there has to be a reason for that
[2016/02/01 12:10:04] <brmbrmcar> It sounds and looks awful.
[2016/02/01 12:10:18] <brmbrmcar> It relies on indentation.
[2016/02/01 12:10:50] <mt> proper indentation > everything else :D
[2016/02/01 12:11:00] <mt> >it looks awful
[2016/02/01 12:11:06] <mt> have you seen decorators
[2016/02/01 12:11:07] <brmbrmcar> Yes, butit shouldn't affect code.
[2016/02/01 12:11:35] <mt> it should, because improper indentation will sooner or later lead to a bug because developers won't understand their code
[2016/02/01 12:12:20] <brmbrmcar> I often change indentation to what seems best.
[2016/02/01 12:13:04] <mt> 4 characters wide, spaces; what Python uses and what is best for everything
[2016/02/01 12:14:48] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: I suggest to you: Brainfuck.

[2016/02/01 15:21:32] <Hume2> There are double letters ecen in Czech, but for some reason.
[2016/02/01 15:22:45] <Hume2> It's only when a sufix ends on the same letter as the root begins or similar situations.
[2016/02/01 15:23:01] <brmbrmcar> Sufix?
[2016/02/01 15:23:03] <brmbrmcar> LOL
[2016/02/01 15:23:10] <Hume2> Prefix
[2016/02/01 15:23:20] <Hume2> My mistake.
[2016/02/01 15:23:31] <brmbrmcar> No,the spelling of sufix.
[2016/02/01 15:24:00] <Hume2> How is it then? Suffix?
[2016/02/01 15:24:30] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/01 15:24:37] <brmbrmcar> I think.
[2016/02/01 15:25:15] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/01 15:26:22] <Hume2> Can this be a [ci skip]? I'm not sure.
[2016/02/01 15:26:29] <brmbrmcar> Wht be?
[2016/02/01 15:26:49] <Hume2> That grammar and formating fix.
[2016/02/01 15:27:06] <brmbrmcar> Is it in /src?
[2016/02/01 15:27:26] <Hume2> Yes, it is.
[2016/02/01 15:27:31] <brmbrmcar> I'd be onthe safe side.
[2016/02/01 15:28:13] <Hume2> I think so. Eventually the next build will test it.
[2016/02/01 15:29:22] <Tobbi> Hume2: It can. Just make sure it compiles locally.
[2016/02/01 15:30:15] <Tobbi> It can be expected that whatever compiled before will also compile afterwards.

[2016/02/02 06:29:10] <Tobbi> Hume2: By the way: If a member function calls the exact same member function of the base class, it is obsolete, isn't it?
[2016/02/02 06:36:25] <Hume2> Tobbi: Indeed, it is.
[2016/02/02 06:36:43] <Tobbi> Hume2: Let me look through the code for any occurrences...
[2016/02/02 06:41:27] <Tobbi> Hume2: I wonder whether we should have a const version of the collision_* functions...
[2016/02/02 06:41:59] <Hume2> Tobbi: It has something to do with the objects.
[2016/02/02 06:42:18] <Hume2> For example there the on_ground flag is updated.
[2016/02/02 06:43:14] <Hume2> The const is only for functions those don't modify the object variables, right?
[2016/02/02 06:43:20] <Tobbi> Hume2: Exactly.
[2016/02/02 06:43:35] <Hume2> So they can't be const, I think.
[2016/02/02 06:44:04] <Tobbi> Hume2: If they only return FORCE_MOVE; they can.
[2016/02/02 06:44:10] <Tobbi> (some do that)
[2016/02/02 06:44:45] <Hume2> Yes, but is that possible, even when the function in the parent calss isn't const?
[2016/02/02 06:46:18] <Tobbi> Hume2: You know that you can have "collision_solid()" and "collision_solid() const" both in the same class.
[2016/02/02 06:46:51] <Tobbi> Oh, wait!
[2016/02/02 06:46:53] <Tobbi> Can we?
[2016/02/02 06:46:56] <Tobbi> I don't know.
[2016/02/02 06:53:23] <Tobbi> Hume2: What do we do about this scripting interface thing...?
[2016/02/02 06:53:33] <Tobbi> Scripting interface is not safe from memory access violations.
[2016/02/02 06:53:45] <Hume2> Hmmm...
[2016/02/02 06:54:00] <Tobbi> I kind of have an idea...
[2016/02/02 06:54:04] <Tobbi> But I need to think this through.
[2016/02/02 06:54:37] <Tobbi> Hume2: We need to change create_wrapper.cpp and add NULL checks.
[2016/02/02 06:54:49] <Hume2> I'll look
[2016/02/02 06:57:12] <Tobbi> Oh!
[2016/02/02 06:57:14] <Tobbi> I got it.
[2016/02/02 07:06:06] <Tobbi> I probably fixed it.

[2016/02/02 10:09:53] <Tobbi> I think this might be easier than using the text file approach.
[2016/02/02 10:10:03] <sydney_untangle> Hrm.
[2016/02/02 10:10:09] <sydney_untangle> Well, you can do it. :)
[2016/02/02 10:10:29] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: If I had a spare SD card, I could do it on my rbpi-
[2016/02/02 10:10:32] <Tobbi> But I don't have one.
[2016/02/02 10:10:45] <Tobbi> I could technically shutdown my rbpi, dump the sd card contents to my HDD...and then try it.
[2016/02/02 10:10:59] <Tobbi> But that wouldn't be a permanent solution.
[2016/02/02 10:11:39] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I just don't want something uploading to github constantly.
[2016/02/02 10:11:45] <sydney_untangle> 5 mins it more often than i like.
[2016/02/02 10:11:58] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Hrm...you're right. It's actually not that much of a good solution.
[2016/02/02 10:12:08] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: So, there we know what you can send me: A rbpi.
[2016/02/02 10:12:11] <Tobbi> (a second one)
[2016/02/02 10:12:13] <Tobbi> With SD card...
[2016/02/02 10:12:20] <sydney_untangle> Hehe.
[2016/02/02 10:12:32] <Tobbi> Currently, mine runs openelec.
[2016/02/02 10:12:38] <Tobbi> Although I don't use that very often.
[2016/02/02 10:12:41] <sydney_untangle> I dont have one myself, so why would i get you a second one? :p
[2016/02/02 10:13:05] <sydney_untangle> I have a beast of an old desktop that you can have if you will pay shipping. :D
[2016/02/02 10:13:21] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Sorry, have that myself. What does your logger run on?
[2016/02/02 10:13:38] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Another beast of an old desktop. ;)
[2016/02/02 10:13:43] <Tobbi> I see...
[2016/02/02 10:13:57] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: rbpi would probably be less resource-wasting...
[2016/02/02 10:14:04] <sydney_untangle> Not the nicest to the electric bill... but...
[2016/02/02 10:14:08] <sydney_untangle> Meh. :p
[2016/02/02 10:14:21] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: But i cannot hook 4 HDDs to a RPI.
[2016/02/02 10:14:39] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Why would you want to do that, anyway?
[2016/02/02 10:14:48] <Tobbi> Also, you can, if the power supply is strong enough, I guess.
[2016/02/02 10:14:54] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I use my server for backups and such.
[2016/02/02 10:14:57] <Tobbi> I see...

[2016/02/02 10:16:38] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: oh god.
[2016/02/02 10:16:42] <sydney_untangle> And it is my IRC client, my logger and red_bot's host.
[2016/02/02 10:16:56] <Tobbi> Okay, I will probably dump my SD card content to disk.
[2016/02/02 10:17:08] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: lol.
[2016/02/02 10:17:16] <sydney_untangle> Yeah, this thing is not being replaced...
[2016/02/02 10:17:31] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I want to try out botbot without jeopardizing my system.
[2016/02/02 10:17:37] <sydney_untangle> I'd buy a router with USB support before a RPI.
[2016/02/02 10:17:45] <sydney_untangle> Use a VM or something?
[2016/02/02 10:19:37] <sydney_untangle> Hrm... what else do i do with my server, oh yes, i use it as a NAS as well.

[2016/02/02 10:22:04] <Tobbi> Oh, yeah, a VM might work.
[2016/02/02 10:24:14] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: What else do you want my server to do? :p Im thinking of installing owncloud on it, but it won't be of much use if i cannot access it from outside of my home network...
[2016/02/02 10:24:41] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: That's true. I tried installing OwnCloud on my rbpi...performance was...urgh.
[2016/02/02 10:25:17] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: hehe.
[2016/02/02 10:25:24] <sydney_untangle> This has a little more resources. ;)
[2016/02/02 10:25:54] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: I'd also like to install PFSense, except its BSD. o_O
[2016/02/02 10:26:01] <Tobbi> PFSense_
[2016/02/02 10:28:12] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: What's PFSense?

[2016/02/02 12:27:18] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I guess google would then hire me for sure.
[2016/02/02 12:28:04] * sydney_untangle gives up...
[2016/02/02 12:28:30] <brmbrmcar> A GPS isn't that much aroundhere.
[2016/02/02 12:28:30] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: What about giving me a new raspberry pi instead of "up"?

[2016/02/02 12:29:43] <mt> I didn't want to annoy you with a highlight :P
[2016/02/02 12:30:10] <brmbrmcar> Is that meantto be a ??
[2016/02/02 12:30:18] <Hume2> o-umlaut

[2016/02/02 12:30:41] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: LOL, I could buy myself 300 from the salary I'd get from a potential investor.
[2016/02/02 12:30:47] <brmbrmcar> Fine.

[2016/02/02 12:31:26] <brmbrmcar> I looked itup.
[2016/02/02 12:31:47] <Tobbi> mt: Would you be willing to host botbot instead of me?
[2016/02/02 12:31:56] <Tobbi> Botbot is actually better than this damn text file...
[2016/02/02 12:32:21] <brmbrmcar> A new botis coming?

[2016/02/02 12:35:06] <mt> hm, still have an almost-idle server in US-LAX

[2016/02/02 12:36:58] <mt> irssi + cronjob calling git, I guess
[2016/02/02 12:37:14] <mt> on that US-LAX server
[2016/02/02 12:37:24] <mt> I could probably host daily txt logs
[2016/02/02 12:37:24] <Tobbi> mt: How much do you pay for your servers anyway?
[2016/02/02 12:37:27] <mt> or monthly
[2016/02/02 12:37:31] <sydney_untangle> A cronjob copying the logs to a specified folder then uploading to github with git.
[2016/02/02 12:37:58] <brmbrmcar> irssi isn't involved.
[2016/02/02 12:38:09] <brmbrmcar> red_bot does it.
[2016/02/02 12:38:09] <sydney_untangle> Nope.
[2016/02/02 12:38:22] <sydney_untangle> red_bot does the logging itself.
[2016/02/02 12:38:31] <mt> Tobbi: 10 USD/month for my server in UK-LON (1 GB RAM, KVM), 0 USD/month for the US-LAX server (128 MB RAM, OpenVZ)
[2016/02/02 12:38:36] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: So this is how people make those crappy apps. http://mashable.com/2013/12/03/build-mobile-apps/
[2016/02/02 12:39:15] <mt> for the latter server, I however have access to an admin webfrontend that lets me create more containers on the same host machine
[2016/02/02 12:39:42] <Tobbi> :)
[2016/02/02 12:40:39] <sydney_untangle> mt: What is US-LAX?
[2016/02/02 12:40:55] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: That is a US american who is lactose-intolerant.

[2016/02/02 12:42:03] <Tobbi> We can meet up :P
[2016/02/02 12:42:25] <Tobbi> ...and you can bring the raspberry pis you promised me :P
[2016/02/02 12:43:19] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Will you have that app coded? :D
[2016/02/02 12:43:31] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Probably not, but I'd pretend I do.
[2016/02/02 12:43:40] <sydney_untangle> ...

[2016/02/02 12:46:49] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: I am not the first person who wants to be able to have beaming technology or warp technology, either. Yet, no one has invented stuff in that aspect.
[2016/02/02 12:48:00] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: This isn't so complicated. :p
[2016/02/02 12:48:06] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Who knows...
[2016/02/02 12:48:12] <mt> In theory you can teleport objects over a maximum distance of ~144 km
[2016/02/02 12:48:24] <Hume2> For flat terrain it's not as hard.
[2016/02/02 12:48:34] <mt> However, you need very much energy
[2016/02/02 12:48:38] <Hume2> However, tell me which field is totally flat.
[2016/02/02 12:48:50] <Tobbi> mt: And if we teleport humans, they'd likely be dead then, won't they?
[2016/02/02 12:49:04] <mt> most likely
[2016/02/02 12:49:13] <brmbrmcar> To much FORCE
[2016/02/02 12:49:14] <mt> if we made progress, they'd only have cancer
[2016/02/02 12:49:20] <brmbrmcar> s/To/Too/
[2016/02/02 12:49:20] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "Too much FORCE"
[2016/02/02 12:49:31] <Hume2> cancer :D
[2016/02/02 12:49:49] <brmbrmcar> Teleporting is impossible.
[2016/02/02 12:50:01] <Hume2> It's like 3D printer :D
[2016/02/02 12:50:06] <brmbrmcar> JUst moving too quickly for systems to pickup movement.
[2016/02/02 12:51:07] <Hume2> If we teleported the signal across the computer, we could have faster computers.
[2016/02/02 12:51:49] <brmbrmcar> What is this teleporting rubbish?
[2016/02/02 12:52:14] <brmbrmcar> Do I have a different definition of teleport?
[2016/02/02 12:52:41] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Teleport != Airport you see on TV.
[2016/02/02 12:52:44] * sydney_untangle cries...
[2016/02/02 12:52:53] * Hume2 teleports
[2016/02/02 12:53:05] <mt> Hume2: I wonder why no one has yet created network interfaces using quantum technology
[2016/02/02 12:53:26] <Hume2> It's too expensive I think.
[2016/02/02 12:53:31] <mt> like I mean this thing that specifies that if you change something with one particle, the other will react too, faster than light
[2016/02/02 12:53:40] <Tobbi> Yup.
[2016/02/02 12:53:45] <mt> That would allow us to have a global maximum latency of 0 ms
[2016/02/02 12:54:10] <Hume2> I think that Microsoft needs such speed :P
[2016/02/02 12:54:23] <Tobbi> mt: How far are we art implementing that? Is there a proposal?
[2016/02/02 12:54:31] <Tobbi> s/art/with
[2016/02/02 12:54:32] <Tobbi> s/art/with/
[2016/02/02 12:54:32] <red_bot> Tobbi meant: "s/with/with"
[2016/02/02 12:54:36] <mt> no
[2016/02/02 12:54:46] <Tobbi> hmm...
[2016/02/02 12:54:47] <brmbrmcar> These quantum technologies are VERY far into the future.

[2016/02/02 12:58:12] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: Having no money would ruin the world as well.
[2016/02/02 12:58:12] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/02 12:58:41] <Hume2> I think that the money is now just a couple of numbers.

[2016/02/02 13:04:10] <mt> brmbrmcar: (italic doesn't display as well here, it's probably because there's no italic fontface of this family)
[2016/02/02 13:04:17] <brmbrmcar> OK
[2016/02/02 13:04:25] <Hume2> If you copy it to an editor with a proportional charset, it should display correctly.

[2016/02/02 13:16:54] <mt> however
[2016/02/02 13:17:02] <mt> I'd generally suggest +S (SSL-only)
[2016/02/02 13:17:07] <Tobbi> talk to you guys later.
[2016/02/02 13:17:14] <brmbrmcar> How do you use SSL?
[2016/02/02 13:17:17] <mt> SSL-only because http://www.charybdis.io/2016/01/30/charybdis-and-ircv3-3-sts.html
[2016/02/02 13:17:32] <mt> brmbrmcar: you configure your client to use it, duh

[2016/02/02 13:18:24] <brmbrmcar> You  just enable SSL?

[2016/02/02 13:19:05] <brmbrmcar> How do I automate that.
[2016/02/02 13:19:07] <brmbrmcar> ?
[2016/02/02 13:19:19] <mt> automate?
[2016/02/02 13:19:27] <mt> if you /save in irssi
[2016/02/02 13:19:33] <mt> it will keep the configuration
[2016/02/02 13:19:38] <mt> after restarts
[2016/02/02 13:19:46] <brmbrmcar> And that will replace the old one?
[2016/02/02 13:19:55] <mt> what old one?
[2016/02/02 13:20:02] <brmbrmcar> THeone I have on now.
[2016/02/02 13:20:09] <mt> what is the one?
[2016/02/02 13:20:11] <brmbrmcar> But I saved it differently.
[2016/02/02 13:20:21] <brmbrmcar> THe auto-conection.
[2016/02/02 13:20:43] <mt> brmbrmcar: the ssl options also work for /server
[2016/02/02 13:20:49] <mt> which is, after /save, permanent
[2016/02/02 13:20:56] <sydney_untangle> So, here is a question. My grandma has a laptop with UEFI, but i would like to wipe it and install debian on it, but im wondering if its that simple. I have secure boot turned off.
[2016/02/02 13:20:56] <brmbrmcar> Shall I just run it?
[2016/02/02 13:21:02] <mt> and
[2016/02/02 13:21:04] <mt> 19:20     When using the ADD parameter on a server that already exists, the
[2016/02/02 13:21:07] <mt> 19:20     configuration will be merged with each other.
[2016/02/02 13:21:10] <mt> see /help server
[2016/02/02 13:21:28] <mt> you obviously then need to reconnect to make the change effective
[2016/02/02 13:22:01] <brmbrmcar> I did that, just runs freenode2.
[2016/02/02 13:22:14] <brmbrmcar> No SASL even
[2016/02/02 13:22:44] <brmbrmcar> Nothing.
[2016/02/02 13:22:45] <sydney_untangle> Do any of you have one of these machines with UEFI?
[2016/02/02 13:23:30] @ Quit: brmbrmcar: Quit: restart
[2016/02/02 13:23:47] <mt> I have an UEFI mainboard, don't know if it's a proper implementation though
[2016/02/02 13:23:57] @ brmbrmcar joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/02 13:24:19] <mt> proper implementation = rm -rf /sys/firmare/efi is recoverable
[2016/02/02 13:24:26] <sydney_untangle> Not fun... I like the good old bios.
[2016/02/02 13:24:33] <mt> UEFI <3
[2016/02/02 13:24:38] <mt> if properly implemented
[2016/02/02 13:24:41] <mt> I mean heh
[2016/02/02 13:24:42] <sydney_untangle> True.
[2016/02/02 13:24:47] <mt> you can boot without bootloader
[2016/02/02 13:25:04] <mt> folks, DON'T RUN THAT RM COMMAND ABOVE
[2016/02/02 13:25:22] <sydney_untangle> lol. ;)

[2016/02/02 14:33:39] <Hume2> Finally done.
[2016/02/02 14:34:07] <Hume2> When it's 8×10, the dpi doesn't matter.
[2016/02/02 14:34:54] <brmbrmcar> No.
[2016/02/02 14:36:08] <Hume2> It's just a couople of black and white squares.
[2016/02/02 14:36:30] <Hume2> When ecah square was 1px, the result would be the same.
[2016/02/02 14:36:49] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 14:37:46] <brmbrmcar> What did you jus do?
[2016/02/02 14:38:21] <Hume2> The chessboard.
[2016/02/02 14:39:00] <brmbrmcar> It took a long time then.
[2016/02/02 14:39:09] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/02 14:39:22] <brmbrmcar> Our laser is very qick.
[2016/02/02 14:39:31] <brmbrmcar> Never used it myself.
[2016/02/02 14:40:05] <Hume2> It was printed quickly, but putting it all together toke so long time.
[2016/02/02 14:40:34] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2016/02/02 14:40:50] <brmbrmcar> Was there a large border then?
[2016/02/02 14:41:32] <Hume2> Not large, but there was on echa page.
[2016/02/02 14:41:38] <Hume2> *each
[2016/02/02 14:42:06] <brmbrmcar> Did you hide it?
[2016/02/02 14:42:20] <Hume2> No, I cut it off.
[2016/02/02 14:42:55] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2016/02/02 14:43:02] <Hume2> I'll write the coordinates on the tiles at the edges.
[2016/02/02 14:43:02] <brmbrmcar> Easier to play.
[2016/02/02 14:43:07] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 14:44:11] <brmbrmcar> I want a giant printer, and then to stick a load of pages together.#
[2016/02/02 14:44:24] <brmbrmcar> It would be super-giant more quickly.
[2016/02/02 14:44:32] <brmbrmcar> 4913x4913.
[2016/02/02 14:44:35] <Hume2> :D That I'd like too.
[2016/02/02 14:45:49] <brmbrmcar> How long would that ake with A4?
[2016/02/02 14:46:14] <Hume2> I'll calculate it.
[2016/02/02 14:46:56] <Hume2> It would be 302580 pages. o.O
[2016/02/02 14:47:07] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 14:48:02] <brmbrmcar> I want it!
[2016/02/02 14:48:16] <brmbrmcar> I need a load of paper.
[2016/02/02 14:48:26] <Hume2> And ink :D
[2016/02/02 14:48:33] @ swift110_ joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/02 14:48:55] <brmbrmcar> A lot of ink.
[2016/02/02 14:49:11] <Hume2> I have a lot of paper, but not even 302580 pages.
[2016/02/02 14:49:14] <brmbrmcar> Iwaste ink at school deliberately.
[2016/02/02 14:49:37] <Hume2> I too.
[2016/02/02 14:49:37] <brmbrmcar> I just extract ink fromthere.
[2016/02/02 14:50:01] <Hume2> I usually draw useless drawings.
[2016/02/02 14:50:10] <brmbrmcar> The only disadvantage is I can't eat it afterwards.
[2016/02/02 14:50:20] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 14:50:38] <brmbrmcar> I scribble over the school logos in tests.
[2016/02/02 14:50:44] <Hume2> I try to not waste it, but it's hard.
[2016/02/02 14:50:47] <brmbrmcar> Internal tests.
[2016/02/02 14:50:55] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2016/02/02 14:50:59] @ bb010g_ joined channel #supertux
[2016/02/02 14:51:07] <Hume2> Yeah, tests.
[2016/02/02 14:51:09] @ Quit: bb010g: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2016/02/02 14:51:39] <brmbrmcar> I always draw a hedgehog too.
[2016/02/02 14:51:40] <Hume2> I used to store them for insane long time, but now I use them as a paper that is used from one side.
[2016/02/02 14:51:46] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 14:52:08] <Hume2> My drawings are something abstract usually.
[2016/02/02 14:52:31] @ bb010g_ is now known as bb010g
[2016/02/02 14:52:32] <Hume2> Or i edit the text to make something funny :D
[2016/02/02 14:53:23] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 14:53:39] <Hume2> Minor edits can change the meaning rapidly.
[2016/02/02 14:53:46] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 14:54:04] <brmbrmcar> If Imake anerror tjough,I just scribble it right out.
[2016/02/02 14:54:27] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/02 14:54:31] <brmbrmcar> Maybe I should just change the meaning, and lave it.
[2016/02/02 14:54:41] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 14:54:47] <brmbrmcar> Ijust right "brm brm car" over it.
[2016/02/02 14:54:57] <brmbrmcar> HIdes all gaps.
[2016/02/02 14:55:12] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 14:55:39] <Hume2> I usually turn some sentences to negative.
[2016/02/02 14:55:45] <brmbrmcar> Or what I meant to put.
[2016/02/02 14:55:46] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 14:56:55] <Hume2> Sometimes there's a form on the other side, not relevent to the test, so I fill in some nonsenses.
[2016/02/02 14:57:29] <brmbrmcar> I do that with proper, serious parts.
[2016/02/02 14:57:48] <brmbrmcar> I shouldn't but it tests the strictness of marking.
[2016/02/02 14:58:13] <Hume2> I've once done it with tax return :D
[2016/02/02 14:58:21] <Hume2> Not mine :D
[2016/02/02 14:58:36] <brmbrmcar> :D

[2016/02/02 14:59:44] <Hume2> When there's a form where they were supposed to tick A B C or D, I puth there an E and tick it.
[2016/02/02 15:00:16] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:00:48] <brmbrmcar> They seem to drop that thing aroun here.
[2016/02/02 15:00:58] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/02 15:01:14] <brmbrmcar> Probably a pathetixc attempt to stop cheating.
[2016/02/02 15:01:53] <Hume2> Maybe.
[2016/02/02 15:02:17] <Hume2> I think that they should allow to cheat, because noone remembers all those ᑎ̲.
[2016/02/02 15:02:37] <Hume2> Well, some students do.
[2016/02/02 15:02:39] <brmbrmcar> Wit for the ,ogs then.
[2016/02/02 15:03:29] <brmbrmcar> I like voiding my work.
[2016/02/02 15:04:11] <Hume2> I too, sometimes.
[2016/02/02 15:04:34] <Hume2> I have a collection of paper boats made of English tests :D
[2016/02/02 15:04:41] <brmbrmcar> Once I din't want to take part in this competition, so I said I was zero.
[2016/02/02 15:04:49] <brmbrmcar> I don't try that.
[2016/02/02 15:05:21] <brmbrmcar> Some peopke will accept that if you give it too them to mark.
[2016/02/02 15:05:32] <Hume2> "The competitions are always won by someone else."
[2016/02/02 15:05:57] <brmbrmcar> It doesn't say "don't make this into a boat," does it?
[2016/02/02 15:06:11] <Hume2> No, it doesn't.
[2016/02/02 15:06:31] <brmbrmcar> There is no definition of anything.
[2016/02/02 15:06:36] <Hume2> Once we had to return that test, but I had already made that boat.
[2016/02/02 15:06:49] <brmbrmcar> That is not really void, but most will say so. :D
[2016/02/02 15:06:57] <brmbrmcar> Any trouble?
[2016/02/02 15:07:04] <Hume2> Not really.
[2016/02/02 15:07:21] <Hume2> The teacher was just a bit annoyed.
[2016/02/02 15:07:31] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2016/02/02 15:08:18] <Hume2> I usually void those small tests.
[2016/02/02 15:08:24] <brmbrmcar> Oh yes.
[2016/02/02 15:08:44] <Hume2> I write some temporary notes on it and then i throw it away.
[2016/02/02 15:08:53] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:09:28] <brmbrmcar> I cheat those.
[2016/02/02 15:09:38] <brmbrmcar> Well, I did once.
[2016/02/02 15:09:57] <Hume2> it's strange, but I've never cheated.
[2016/02/02 15:10:32] <Hume2> I don't have "good" marks, but still good enoug to pass.
[2016/02/02 15:10:54] <brmbrmcar> Sometimes, even when it seems formal,there is a break in between taking the test.
[2016/02/02 15:11:19] <brmbrmcar> I just know how to take the advantages.
[2016/02/02 15:11:54] <Hume2> i never had a break in between taking the test.
[2016/02/02 15:12:10] <brmbrmcar> Well, that's my school.
[2016/02/02 15:12:16] <brmbrmcar> So informal.
[2016/02/02 15:12:39] <brmbrmcar> Except on pointless things.
[2016/02/02 15:12:49] <Hume2> That makes sense.
[2016/02/02 15:13:18] <Hume2> I hate how they torture us with ᑎ̲.
[2016/02/02 15:13:29] <brmbrmcar> What?
[2016/02/02 15:13:40] <brmbrmcar> Describe the symbol.
[2016/02/02 15:13:53] <Hume2> The same symbol again.
[2016/02/02 15:13:59] <brmbrmcar> OK.
[2016/02/02 15:14:16] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:14:28] <brmbrmcar> What do you mean?
[2016/02/02 15:14:54] <Hume2> I mean the most of biology.
[2016/02/02 15:15:21] <brmbrmcar> Ah.
[2016/02/02 15:16:25] <Hume2> You know, recognizing what kind of organism is what.
[2016/02/02 15:17:01] <Hume2> I just want to know what is edible, that would be enough.
[2016/02/02 15:17:07] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:17:59] <brmbrmcar> It is soboring.
[2016/02/02 15:18:08] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/02 15:19:18] <brmbrmcar> I never got those cells things.
[2016/02/02 15:19:35] <brmbrmcar> I just messed it up.
[2016/02/02 15:19:41] <Hume2> It's useless for the most of students.
[2016/02/02 15:21:39] <brmbrmcar> Yes,
[2016/02/02 15:22:04] <brmbrmcar> Jusyt learnit later.
[2016/02/02 15:22:23] <Hume2> I wouldn't learn it even later :D
[2016/02/02 15:22:57] <Hume2> When I don't know, I just type something.
[2016/02/02 15:23:37] <Hume2> Question: Where lives <some kind of fish>?
[2016/02/02 15:23:47] <Hume2> Answer: In the water.
[2016/02/02 15:23:59] <brmbrmcar> Correct!
[2016/02/02 15:24:18] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 15:24:46] <brmbrmcar> Top of the class is Hume2, with 1 out of 1 correct!
[2016/02/02 15:24:52] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 15:25:13] <Hume2> Question: Can the biggest shark eat a human? And why?
[2016/02/02 15:25:27] <Hume2> Answer: Yes, I've seen it in TV.
[2016/02/02 15:25:39] <Hume2> It wans't correct though.
[2016/02/02 15:25:49] <brmbrmcar> I guess not.
[2016/02/02 15:25:52] <brmbrmcar> 1 mark.
[2016/02/02 15:25:59] <brmbrmcar> The why was wrog.
[2016/02/02 15:26:26] <Hume2> Those why questions are something annoying in biology.
[2016/02/02 15:26:44] <Hume2> Once I've answered: Because the god has made it that way.
[2016/02/02 15:26:50] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:27:27] <brmbrmcar> They are bad questions.
[2016/02/02 15:28:02] <Hume2> I heard that there was a cell and a rabit and question: Which of these have only one cell? And why?
[2016/02/02 15:28:34] <Hume2> He didn't know what to answer on that why, so I adviced him to answer:
[2016/02/02 15:28:41] <Hume2> It was once in TV.
[2016/02/02 15:28:45] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:29:37] <brmbrmcar> I currently keep being asked "Why do plants do photosynthesis?" GRRR
[2016/02/02 15:29:47] <brmbrmcar> For fu.
[2016/02/02 15:29:50] <brmbrmcar> n
[2016/02/02 15:29:52] <Hume2> Terrible question.
[2016/02/02 15:30:07] <brmbrmcar> Seems more likely.
[2016/02/02 15:30:58] <Hume2> I think that the teacher doesn't want to know why, but what it causes.
[2016/02/02 15:31:27] <brmbrmcar> Oxegen, glucose. Apparently.
[2016/02/02 15:31:48] <Hume2> Or isn't the answer: Because it contains cholophyle?
[2016/02/02 15:32:01] <Hume2> *chlorophyle or how it is.
[2016/02/02 15:32:10] <brmbrmcar> Yes, maybe.
[2016/02/02 15:32:16] <brmbrmcar> I don't know.
[2016/02/02 15:32:36] <Hume2> There are some questions those answers are illogical.
[2016/02/02 15:32:42] <brmbrmcar> Yes,
[2016/02/02 15:32:53] <Hume2> You just have to learn what answer belongs to which question.
[2016/02/02 15:33:14] <Hume2> Even when it doesn't make any sense.
[2016/02/02 15:33:24] <brmbrmcar> I always mess this up.
[2016/02/02 15:33:40] <Hume2> I mess this up too.
[2016/02/02 15:33:44] <brmbrmcar> THere is always a range of excuses why I got marked wrong.
[2016/02/02 15:33:46] @ Quit: Karkus: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[2016/02/02 15:34:28] <Hume2> Yes, even when the excuses don't make it any better.
[2016/02/02 15:34:52] <Hume2> Usually.
[2016/02/02 15:34:53] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:35:54] <brmbrmcar> And in the last test there was one seriously bad question.
[2016/02/02 15:36:14] <Hume2> go on
[2016/02/02 15:37:01] <brmbrmcar> THere was a radiator.
[2016/02/02 15:37:29] <brmbrmcar> It was rated lets say 6 kW (I can't remember)
[2016/02/02 15:37:54] <brmbrmcar> Energy costs 12p or whatever perkWh.
[2016/02/02 15:38:14] <brmbrmcar> How much does it cost for 12 hours?
[2016/02/02 15:38:31] <Hume2> Oh, these questions.
[2016/02/02 15:38:55] <brmbrmcar> Seems alright, but the answer was apparently 864 kWh.
[2016/02/02 15:39:08] <Hume2> LOL
[2016/02/02 15:39:10] <brmbrmcar> Ah, 862p.
[2016/02/02 15:39:14] <brmbrmcar> 864.
[2016/02/02 15:39:19] <brmbrmcar> Sorry.
[2016/02/02 15:39:28] <Hume2> That's weird.
[2016/02/02 15:39:30] <brmbrmcar> Irt still doesn't make sense
[2016/02/02 15:39:57] <Hume2> And 8 Pounds 64p was incorrect, I guess.
[2016/02/02 15:40:18] <brmbrmcar> THe answer would work if it was 6kWh rated, and it didn't say tat.
[2016/02/02 15:40:53] <brmbrmcar> I ened up with a crazy answer.
[2016/02/02 15:41:07] <Hume2> Yes, it's a crazy question.
[2016/02/02 15:42:01] <brmbrmcar> And they give out these books with even crazier stuff.
[2016/02/02 15:42:16] <Hume2> Yeah, no wonder.
[2016/02/02 15:43:18] <brmbrmcar> They cost money!
[2016/02/02 15:43:54] <Hume2> Yes, but the content is almost the same as in the older books.
[2016/02/02 15:44:43] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:44:55] <brmbrmcar> JUst updated for the new test things.
[2016/02/02 15:45:26] <Hume2> That makes sense, because it changes frequently.
[2016/02/02 15:46:16] <Hume2> I'm not even talking about that it's somewere in the Internet, bazilion times.
[2016/02/02 15:46:24] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:46:39] <brmbrmcar> I didn't want it.
[2016/02/02 15:47:03] <Hume2> Yes, but it's not possible to get rid of it.
[2016/02/02 15:47:25] <Hume2> Many people working at the press would lost their jobs.
[2016/02/02 15:47:43] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:47:57] <Hume2> This and many other reasons.
[2016/02/02 15:48:29] <brmbrmcar> I hate when they make you pau for these things.
[2016/02/02 15:48:49] <Hume2> I hate that too.
[2016/02/02 15:48:57] <brmbrmcar> It's a stste school!
[2016/02/02 15:49:22] <Hume2> They could just tell the links where to get that info for free.
[2016/02/02 15:49:54] <brmbrmcar> And in art, you have to splash out the equivalent of around ?2.00 on a terrible scrap book.
[2016/02/02 15:50:03] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:50:08] <brmbrmcar> They should!
[2016/02/02 15:50:18] <brmbrmcar> Or, photocopy it. :D
[2016/02/02 15:50:38] <Hume2> :D However, you know, all those officiers losing their jobs.
[2016/02/02 15:51:12] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:51:17] <brmbrmcar> Jobs.

[2016/02/02 15:51:37] <Hume2> You know, all the army of officiers.
[2016/02/02 15:51:58] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:52:13] <brmbrmcar> They need jobs, I do guess.
[2016/02/02 15:52:30] <Hume2> Indeed. And they are willing to fight.
[2016/02/02 15:53:11] * brmbrmcar is scared
[2016/02/02 15:53:16] <brmbrmcar> THey really?
[2016/02/02 15:53:37] <Hume2> No, like law-fighting.
[2016/02/02 15:53:57] <Hume2> They will find something that you did wrong and blame you.
[2016/02/02 15:54:16] <brmbrmcar> That scares me.
[2016/02/02 15:54:24] <brmbrmcar> Court?
[2016/02/02 15:54:29] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/02 15:54:57] <Hume2> They also have money, so they pay someone to make you trouble.
[2016/02/02 15:55:15] <brmbrmcar> I hate the idea of court.
[2016/02/02 15:55:29] <brmbrmcar> Several hours, trying to defend yourself.
[2016/02/02 15:55:48] <Hume2> I was never at it, so I can't say.
[2016/02/02 15:56:14] <brmbrmcar> I haven't either.
[2016/02/02 15:56:56] <Hume2> Also when the office is big enough, its productivity is more like zero.
[2016/02/02 15:57:19] <Tobbi> great, no space left on device (again)
[2016/02/02 15:57:26] <Hume2> Because the officiers solve mainly the problem of the office itself.
[2016/02/02 15:57:48] <brmbrmcar> :D
[2016/02/02 15:57:53] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/02 15:59:09] <Hume2> In the worst case it also damages the stuff arround.
[2016/02/02 16:00:01] <brmbrmcar> Like what?
[2016/02/02 16:00:46] <Hume2> I mean that the activity they think that is good, is bad for most people.
[2016/02/02 16:01:10] <brmbrmcar> Nice.
[2016/02/02 16:01:21] <brmbrmcar> I agree.
[2016/02/02 16:02:40] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Want to teach me how to code an android app? :p
[2016/02/02 16:02:48] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: No.
[2016/02/02 16:03:10] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Unless you want to program "Add-Ommmm" as an android app.
[2016/02/02 16:03:31] <sydney_untangle> lol.
[2016/02/02 16:03:46] <Hume2> Add-Ommmm :D
[2016/02/02 16:06:34] <brmbrmcar> What is Add-0mmmm?
[2016/02/02 16:09:40] <sydney_untangle> brmbrmcar: A app you can code for me.
[2016/02/02 16:09:40] <Tobbi> You guys don't want to know.
[2016/02/02 16:10:15] <Tobbi> Hume2, brmbrmcar, sydney_untangle: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/addommmm/?src=search
[2016/02/02 16:11:23] <Hume2> :D I'll try it.
[2016/02/02 16:11:30] <Tobbi> Hume2: Doesn't work on recent firefox versions.
[2016/02/02 16:11:36] <Tobbi> I should update it.
[2016/02/02 16:12:12] <Hume2> That's a shame.
[2016/02/02 16:12:44] <Tobbi> Hume2: If you want, study the code and update it. It should be on my github.
[2016/02/02 16:13:11] <Tobbi> Hume2: https://github.com/tobbi/AddOmmmm
[2016/02/02 16:14:29] <Hume2> It was quite fast to make it, wasn't it?
[2016/02/02 16:14:37] <Tobbi> Hume2: I don't remember.
[2016/02/02 16:14:42] <Tobbi> I was just doing this for the fun value of it.
[2016/02/02 16:14:54] <Hume2> I see.
[2016/02/02 16:15:40] <brmbrmcar> Is it any good?
[2016/02/02 16:15:46] <brmbrmcar> s/Is/Was/
[2016/02/02 16:15:46] <red_bot> brmbrmcar meant: "Was it any good?"
[2016/02/02 16:15:58] <Hume2> It's good for school computers :D
[2016/02/02 16:16:08] <Tobbi> Hume2: you got it! :D
[2016/02/02 16:18:53] <brmbrmcar> I don't get it.
[2016/02/02 16:19:15] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: What don't you get?
[2016/02/02 16:20:47] <brmbrmcar> A horse making noise with the picture.
[2016/02/02 16:21:06] <brmbrmcar> Is the horse eating the food.
[2016/02/02 16:21:08] <brmbrmcar> ?
[2016/02/02 16:21:25] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar: *sigh* I should really update the source.
[2016/02/02 16:23:59] <brmbrmcar> :(
[2016/02/02 16:24:29] <Hume2> brmbrmcar: No, I think. I think that the horse doesn't display anyway.
[2016/02/02 16:24:57] <Tobbi> brmbrmcar, Hume2: It's only the lasagna that shows. And while showing it, you can hear a horse sound.
[2016/02/02 16:25:24] <Hume2> I thought so.
[2016/02/02 16:26:27] <brmbrmcar> Yes.
[2016/02/02 16:26:40] <brmbrmcar> I thoughr so too.
[2016/02/02 16:28:27] <sydney_untangle> Cool! https://openrct2.org/
[2016/02/02 16:28:51] <Tobbi> I never played that.
[2016/02/02 16:30:22] <Hume2> Ever notet that the word "sign" is similar to "sigh"?
[2016/02/02 16:31:19] <Tobbi> Hume2: No, I didn't.
[2016/02/02 16:33:51] <Hume2> I'll go to bed, bye!

[2016/02/03 07:15:38] <MCMic> Hello, can you tell me what is the windows equivalent for folder «~/.supertux/» ?
[2016/02/03 07:15:54] <MCMic> I meant «~/.supertux2/»
[2016/02/03 07:16:00] <Hume2> It should be %appdata%/.supertux2
[2016/02/03 07:16:24] <MCMic> hum, and %appdata% is something people can find easily?
[2016/02/03 07:16:54] <Hume2> I guess you can just type it to the Windows explorer and it opens.
[2016/02/03 07:17:02] <MCMic> ok
[2016/02/03 07:17:30] <MCMic> Thanks
[2016/02/03 07:18:02] <MCMic> I’m speedrunning supertux and needed to explain people how to get a fresh profile: http://www.speedrun.com/SuperTux/guide/n1uyf

[2016/02/03 10:53:04] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: And i don't really want to learn how to code...
[2016/02/03 10:53:38] <sydney_untangle> I didn't realize that Android programs are Java. o_O
[2016/02/03 10:53:42] <Tobbi> k
[2016/02/03 10:59:35] <brmbrmcar> Java is evil.
[2016/02/03 11:00:54] <sydney_untangle> brmbrmcar: Oracle Java is evil.
[2016/02/03 11:03:13] <mt> you can also use non-Java code on android
[2016/02/03 11:03:14] <mt> https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html
[2016/02/03 11:07:29] <Tobbi> mt: I tell you: Just: Don't! NDK reminds me of my project. I don't want to be remembered.
[2016/02/03 11:08:06] <Tobbi> Also, sydney_untangle: What's wrong with Java?
[2016/02/03 11:09:05] <mt> Java is just full of security problems
[2016/02/03 11:09:55] <brmbrmcar> sydney_untangle: What's the difference?
[2016/02/03 11:11:13] <sydney_untangle> Well, security holes, and the installer provided by oracle likes to install junkware IE bars on grandparents computers...
[2016/02/03 11:12:11] <brmbrmcar> grandparents computers = bad security
[2016/02/03 11:12:26] <brmbrmcar> Oracle knoes that well.
[2016/02/03 11:14:35] <brmbrmcar> Do they give back data to gain that?

[2016/02/03 12:04:12] <Hume2> It's yeallow.
[2016/02/03 12:04:24] <brmbrmcar> Good.

[2016/02/03 12:05:03] <Hume2> OK
[2016/02/03 12:05:24] <mt> brmbrmcar: please don't

[2016/02/03 12:05:47] <mt> abuse colors
[2016/02/03 12:05:56] <brmbrmcar> I won't.
[2016/02/03 12:06:02] <brmbrmcar> I tested it.
[2016/02/03 12:06:03] <mt> you did
[2016/02/03 12:06:27] <brmbrmcar> I know!
[2016/02/03 12:06:35] <mt> that wasn't testing, since -c is actually -c; if that wouldn't work it would've been discovered before
[2016/02/03 12:06:48] <mt> you did abuse it, that's what I was referring to
[2016/02/03 12:06:48] <brmbrmcar> I know.
[2016/02/03 12:07:08] <mt> consider that as a warning
[2016/02/03 12:07:15] <brmbrmcar> I checked it for reasons of wierdness.

[2016/02/03 12:23:20] <sistemx> Hello, I want ask, if I can use sound and sprites and characters ets to my game. I am beginer and I don't undestand licence fully. Do sombody know?
[2016/02/03 12:29:43] <mt> the best thing you can do is consulting a lawyer
[2016/02/03 12:30:58] <Hume2> Yes, but don't ask two lawyers, because you wouldn't get the same thing :D
[2016/02/03 12:32:34] <Hume2> In short, you can use it even without asking, but uder some kind of termas. I don't remember it much.
[2016/02/03 12:33:21] <mt> most would fall under https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-%28gpl-3%29 or https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/
[2016/02/03 12:33:38] <Hume2> I don't know about the other, but I wouldn't blame you even if you used it incorrectly.
[2016/02/03 12:33:59] <mt> note that these simplifications are just for easier understanding
[2016/02/03 12:34:28] <mt> for the full legal implications, consult with a lawyer and ask them about the actual license content
[2016/02/03 12:35:50] <sistemx> I am talking about supertux
[2016/02/03 12:36:00] <mt> yes
[2016/02/03 12:36:21] <mt> most of supertux would fall under the licenses mentioned
[2016/02/03 12:36:25] <sistemx> I see, so it is not easy as I  thought :(
[2016/02/03 12:36:58] <Hume2> If you want to make some profit, then it's not easy.
[2016/02/03 12:37:19] <sistemx> I   thought, if some thing is "open source" you can use it as I can. But looks too difficult
[2016/02/03 12:37:48] <Hume2> Not really, there's some kind of law jungle arround it.
[2016/02/03 12:37:51] <sistemx> profit is not priority for me now, I am beginer and I want help to Ubuntu touch
[2016/02/03 12:38:05] <mt> it's still copyrighted and you've still got some restrictions
[2016/02/03 12:38:06] <sistemx> So I want make some games
[2016/02/03 12:38:15] <Hume2> Then you just mention the authors of the resources.
[2016/02/03 12:38:25] <Hume2> This should be enough, I hope.
[2016/02/03 12:39:10] <mt> I think even GPL and CC-BY-SA allow commercial redistribution in at least some cases, but DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A LAWYER
[2016/02/03 12:39:32] <Hume2> I am not a lawyer too.
[2016/02/03 12:39:40] <sistemx> So you mean that I will check contact from supertux web site and ask them? Or check names and ask directly to each person?
[2016/02/03 12:40:09] <Hume2> You don't have to ask, I hope.
[2016/02/03 12:40:22] <mt> you don't usually even need to ask, just put their name somewhere in your game (e.g. in the credits)
[2016/02/03 12:40:35] <mt> for most open source licenses
[2016/02/03 12:40:50] <sistemx> Something like this I read before
[2016/02/03 12:41:07] <mt> also, be sure to check the files included in the repos if a file you're going to use is not under the usual license
[2016/02/03 12:41:28] <sistemx> But I just worry, play with license is not fun :(
[2016/02/03 12:41:42] <mt> e.g. there's a soundtrack included in the game that we're only allowed to use due to permission from the original author
[2016/02/03 12:42:05] <sistemx> I see
[2016/02/03 12:42:21] <Hume2> Yes, the GPL says that it should be distributed under the same license.
[2016/02/03 12:42:31] <sistemx> So maybe better way find open source game from one owner
[2016/02/03 12:42:55] <sistemx> it is too complicate :)
[2016/02/03 12:42:56] <mt> most open source projects have multiple authors
[2016/02/03 12:42:58] <sistemx> :(
[2016/02/03 12:43:01] <mt> that's the entire point of it
[2016/02/03 12:43:20] <mt> also http://opengameart.org/ for more art (but check the license too)
[2016/02/03 12:43:37] <mt> oh and what's important to mention:
[2016/02/03 12:43:48] <Hume2> I think that this my mad response speaks for everything: https://github.com/SuperTux/addons/issues/9
[2016/02/03 12:44:04] <mt> we might be exaggerating about this
[2016/02/03 12:44:19] <mt> but we don't want to be liable for stuff you do
[2016/02/03 12:44:20] <sistemx> This site I know, But best is find all together. on this website I can not find all together..
[2016/02/03 12:45:37] <sistemx> Anyway, thanks for help..
[2016/02/03 12:45:45] <mt> Hume2: (that's still open)
[2016/02/03 12:45:54] <Hume2> damn
[2016/02/03 12:46:12] <Hume2> Anyway, do you know why I put there that response?
[2016/02/03 12:46:41] <mt> Hume2: (also in the level files you seem to have specified GPL 2+/CC-BY-SA 3.0 even if you don't care, so something public domain-ish would be appropriate)

[2016/02/03 12:47:05] <mt> if we don't specify in the source place
[2016/02/03 12:47:17] <mt> we'll have a problem when we want to move away from github oslt

[2016/02/03 12:47:57] <Hume2> I responsed like this because I wanted to know whether he really needs to know the license.
[2016/02/03 12:49:02] <Hume2> I knew that this was created just because he wanted to complain.

[2016/02/03 14:04:29] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/03 14:04:39] <Tobbi> Unless you look (or it makes this "ding" sound) the baby might or might not be alive.
[2016/02/03 14:06:09] <Hume2> If the baby was smaller than the wavelength, it would stay alive.

[2016/02/03 14:20:39] <Hume2> They cost only 59 CZK.
[2016/02/03 14:21:46] <Hume2> The price is excluding those wooden parts: http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/necyklopedie/images/6/61/Mezery_v_plotu.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091220130747
[2016/02/03 14:29:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: Surely the baby can observe itself? :D
[2016/02/03 14:29:41] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, the cat can observe itself as well.
[2016/02/03 14:30:07] <Tobbi> :P
[2016/02/03 14:30:12] <Hume2> Yes, but the wave fuction would collapse for us after we open the microwave.
[2016/02/03 14:30:14] <Karkus> Tobbi: Hmmm. I don't understand schrodinger's cat...
[2016/02/03 14:30:27] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's just about the person being outside not being able to observer.
[2016/02/03 14:30:30] <Tobbi> *observe
[2016/02/03 14:30:42] <Tobbi> Also, I forgot quite a lot about this anyway...
[2016/02/03 14:31:50] <Hume2> It's also hard to get it, I think.
[2016/02/03 14:32:25] <Hume2> And it's not much useful if you aren't going to construct quantum computers.
[2016/02/03 14:32:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: But surely whether the person can observe or not doesn't matter :D
[2016/02/03 14:33:04] <Tobbi> Karkus: But, you need an actual observer to make a finite decision about whether the baby is alive or not.
[2016/02/03 14:33:36] <Karkus> Tobbi: What about God :P :D
[2016/02/03 14:33:38] <Karkus> ?
[2016/02/03 14:34:00] <Karkus> Tobbi: Way too philosophical for me.
[2016/02/03 14:34:10] <Hume2> Don't you think Chuck Norris?
[2016/02/03 14:34:13] <Hume2> :P
[2016/02/03 14:34:19] <Tobbi> Oh god... :D Well, he'd know...same for someone who'd observe the baby's cries vanish...
[2016/02/03 14:34:34] <Tobbi> Karkus: It's actually a physics analogy.
[2016/02/03 14:34:54] <Karkus> Tobbi: Is it something to do with Quantum Superpositions?
[2016/02/03 14:35:02] <Tobbi> Karkus: Yes...exactly.
[2016/02/03 14:35:23] <Karkus> Tobbi: It certainly helps me to not understand them at all...
[2016/02/03 14:35:27] <Hume2> Some people are at superposition of two opinions.
[2016/02/03 14:35:42] <Tobbi> Karkus: I was bad at everything in high school.
[2016/02/03 14:35:57] <Tobbi> everything...no exceptions.
[2016/02/03 14:36:58] <Hume2> It doesn't matter. They teach just crap anyway.
[2016/02/03 14:37:10] <Karkus> Tobbi: Nothing at all? Well, I guess with programming you found your place?
[2016/02/03 14:37:25] <Tobbi> Karkus: Well, okay I was good at Philosophy and computer science.
[2016/02/03 14:37:37] <Tobbi> And I might've even been good at other subjects if I had been interested in them.
[2016/02/03 14:37:39] <Tobbi> But I wasn't.
[2016/02/03 14:37:56] <Karkus> Tobbi: You should've tried being interested at maths :D
[2016/02/03 14:38:27] <Tobbi> And no, with programming, I didn't find my place. This is just a temporary thing, I imagine.
[2016/02/03 14:38:34] <Tobbi> I want this to be just a temporary thing.
[2016/02/03 14:38:45] <Tobbi> The outlook of having to program my entire life makes me sad.
[2016/02/03 14:38:49] <Karkus> Tobbi: Fair enough.
[2016/02/03 14:39:01] <Tobbi> :)
[2016/02/03 14:39:35] <Hume2> I don't want to program my life as well. This scares me.
[2016/02/03 14:39:37] <Karkus> Tobbi: About flexlay
[2016/02/03 14:39:41] <Karkus> ~excuse
[2016/02/03 14:39:41] <red_bot> Karkus: It's not plugged in.
[2016/02/03 14:39:48] <Tobbi> Flexlay is not plugged in?
[2016/02/03 14:40:09] <Karkus> Tobbi: No, I'm trying to get a suitable excuse for not committing for a while...
[2016/02/03 14:40:21] <Tobbi> Karkus: oh, don't worry. Neither have I...
[2016/02/03 14:40:24] <Karkus> Tobbi: I've been more busy than usual lately...
[2016/02/03 14:40:36] <Karkus> I will get round to it, soon as I can.
[2016/02/03 14:40:39] <Karkus> ~excuse
[2016/02/03 14:40:39] <red_bot> Karkus: routing problems on the neural net
[2016/02/03 14:40:48] <Tobbi> Karkus: Again, don't worry about it... I have been busy with stuff as well... college...
[2016/02/03 14:41:34] <Karkus> Tobbi, Hume2: Anyways, gtg afk now, bye :D
[2016/02/03 14:41:42] <Tobbi> See you.
[2016/02/03 14:41:49] <Hume2> Bye!
[2016/02/03 14:42:46] <Hume2> Narre has a special subject for numeric technologies.
[2016/02/03 14:43:31] <Hume2> He says that all students except him and one more, fail it properly.
[2016/02/03 14:44:20] <Hume2> And the tests are only transfering numbers from hexadecimary to binary, to decimal etc.
[2016/02/03 14:44:25] <Tobbi> The stuff we do in college is boooring...
[2016/02/03 14:44:39] <Tobbi> And by boring I mean: I cannot just think fastly...
[2016/02/03 14:44:50] <Tobbi> *fast
[2016/02/03 14:44:57] <Hume2> That makes sense.
[2016/02/03 14:45:07] <Tobbi> Hume2: Really or are you kidding me?
[2016/02/03 14:45:17] <Hume2> The most of the request use to be think something fast.
[2016/02/03 14:45:22] <Hume2> I know that.
[2016/02/03 14:45:36] <Tobbi> I really have a problem with long tasks where you don't get somewhere...
[2016/02/03 14:45:44] <Hume2> I too.
[2016/02/03 14:45:59] <Hume2> It gets boring.
[2016/02/03 14:46:12] <Tobbi> Hume2: But maybe that's not a special thing...
[2016/02/03 14:46:33] <Tobbi> Not sure if faster pace is really what I want...
[2016/02/03 14:47:03] <Hume2> I think speed is not as useful as the results.
[2016/02/03 14:47:27] <Tobbi> I know...
[2016/02/03 14:49:06] <Hume2> I liked maths, but it started to bore me, because it starts to be the same all the time.
[2016/02/03 14:49:37] <Hume2> Well, there is a difference between maths and school maths.
[2016/02/03 14:51:05] <Hume2> The teachers accidentally sometimes learn also something from the maths, but that's not important for getting a good mark from test.
[2016/02/03 14:52:48] <Tobbi> Hume2: School is crap. :P
[2016/02/03 14:52:54] <Hume2> Indeed.
[2016/02/03 14:53:01] <Tobbi> Who needs school, if I want I could rule the world. :D
[2016/02/03 14:53:19] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/03 14:55:16] <Hume2> Do you know, how hard is it now?
[2016/02/03 14:55:42] <Hume2> First you must wait for a bad economic situation and think a way how to solve it.
[2016/02/03 14:55:49] <Hume2> :D
[2016/02/03 14:57:03] <Tobbi> ohrm.
[2016/02/03 14:57:05] <Tobbi> hrm
[2016/02/03 14:58:06] <Hume2> And then you just anschluss the states arround and hope that you win :DDDDD
[2016/02/03 15:00:28] <Tobbi> anschluss?
[2016/02/03 15:00:31] <Tobbi> connection?
[2016/02/03 15:00:50] <Hume2> Yes.
[2016/02/03 15:02:02] <Hume2> In Czech we have a special word for connecting Austria to Germany, "anšlusovat".

[2016/02/03 18:27:56] <sydney_untangle> have you*
[2016/02/03 18:28:32] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Not much. I watched videos of "The Hoax Hotel" (scamming scammers). And I just watched a short clip from Pulp Fiction.
[2016/02/03 18:29:25] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Hrm.
[2016/02/03 18:29:34] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Do you know Pulp Fiction?
[2016/02/03 18:29:44] <Tobbi> actually, how old are you?
[2016/02/03 18:30:27] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: 16.
[2016/02/03 18:30:30] <sydney_untangle> No i don't.
[2016/02/03 18:30:56] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Okay, you would be allowed to watch it...
[2016/02/03 18:30:58] <Tobbi> but, nah.
[2016/02/03 18:31:15] <Tobbi> But you can read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction
[2016/02/03 18:32:13] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Eh, i think i will skip.
[2016/02/03 18:32:19] <Tobbi> Okay.
[2016/02/03 18:35:18] <sydney_untangle> Tobbi: Watch some pink panther instead...
[2016/02/03 18:35:28] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: Not at the moment...
[2016/02/03 18:35:46] <sydney_untangle> Heh. :)
[2016/02/03 18:46:23] <Tobbi> sydney_untangle: You just reminded me: I let Microsoft Sam read out this PDF some time ago: http://www.catholiclabor.org/gen-art/cafod-computers.pdf
[2016/02/03 18:46:42] <Tobbi> I still remember it saying "Clean up your computer - Working conditions in the electronic sector"

[2016/02/04 10:09:38] <Tobbi> Okay, what I did was not good.
[2016/02/04 10:09:48] <Tobbi> Force-pushing tinygettext because I tried to integrate upstream changes.
[2016/02/04 10:09:49] <Tobbi> gargh
[2016/02/04 10:10:20] <Tobbi> Should've done a branch instead.

[2016/02/04 11:12:06] <mt> ewww
[2016/02/04 11:12:18] <mt> could you *please* test things in a *test* branch
[2016/02/04 11:13:12] <Tobbi> mt: I have an upstream branch now, which is the test branch.
[2016/02/04 11:13:32] <Tobbi> mt: And, yes, I did manage to restore things to normal and enable branch protection...
[2016/02/04 11:13:41] <Tobbi> for that tinygettext master branch.
[2016/02/04 11:13:58] <mt> I'm talking about the supertux master branch
[2016/02/04 11:14:08] <mt> You shouldn't abuse it as a sandbox to play with
[2016/02/04 11:14:19] <Tobbi> mt: I did test things locally, not knowing that it doesn't fetch the tinygettext source from a different directory.
[2016/02/04 11:14:25] <mt> Because in master, history shouldn't be rewritten
[2016/02/04 11:14:41] <Tobbi> mt: So, I thought it fetches the source from external/tinygettext, but it doesn't...
[2016/02/04 11:14:51] <Tobbi> It creates a different directory, and reuses the source.
[2016/02/04 11:15:03] <Tobbi> And, yes, I am sorry about this.

[2016/02/04 12:01:29] <Tobbi> Okay, I am out of ideas for that appveyor build.
[2016/02/04 12:01:37] <Tobbi> But at least we're now at the latest upstream.
[2016/02/04 12:03:29] <Tobbi> mt, sydney_untangle, Karkus: What do you guys think about having symbols for levelset / worldmap in the game instead of writing it in the add-ons manager?
[2016/02/04 12:03:42] <Tobbi> That way, the list takes up way less space than before.
[2016/02/04 12:03:59] <Tobbi> If we have an icon there...
[2016/02/04 12:04:05] <Karkus> Tobbi: Symbols?
[2016/02/04 12:04:12] <mt> if we have TTF
[2016/02/04 12:04:20] <mt> we could easily add that as character
[2016/02/04 12:04:29] <Tobbi> Karkus: For example: You have one symbol for levelset, I don't know, make something up, and one symbol for worldmap.
[2016/02/04 12:04:45] <Tobbi> Yup, but adding an icon shouldn't be too difficult.
[2016/02/04 12:05:02] <Karkus> Tobbi: That way you know which is which? Sounds good
[2016/02/04 12:06:28] <Tobbi> Karkus: Exactly.

[2016/02/04 14:10:14] <Karkus> Hume2: I guess worldmap could be a small island, and levelset a list?
[2016/02/04 14:10:22] <Karkus> icon of a list
[2016/02/04 14:10:33] <Hume2> Icon of a list, hmmm...
[2016/02/04 14:11:18] <Hume2> A moment...
[2016/02/04 14:12:19] <Hume2> Karkus: Currently we have only worlds.
[2016/02/04 14:12:31] <Karkus> Hume2: test levels?
[2016/02/04 14:13:06] <Hume2> So are we speking about addon manager or about  contrib level menu?
[2016/02/04 14:14:32] <Karkus> Idk it was Tobbi's idea. I guess probably addon manager in which case you are correct
[2016/02/04 14:15:16] <Hume2> Karkus: So currently we have only worldmap addons.
[2016/02/04 14:15:37] <Karkus> Hume2: Then maybe this isn't needed?
[2016/02/04 14:15:47] <Hume2> And I think we should also start considering the quality of the new addons.
[2016/02/04 14:16:09] <Hume2> That way we won't have any levelsets among addons.
[2016/02/04 14:16:35] <Karkus> Hume2: Do you think it would be possible to add the ability to specify a level directory, and the levels appear? e.g. supertux2 ~
[2016/02/04 14:17:09] <Hume2> I'm not sure what are you talking about.
[2016/02/04 14:17:24] <Hume2> Don't you mean supertux2/levels ?
[2016/02/04 14:18:37] <Hume2> Karkus: also: The good levels from levelsets could be included in bonus islands.
[2016/02/04 14:19:39] <Karkus> Hume2: It's an idea. You specify a directory, instead of a single level, and the .stl & .stwm files are displayed so you can play them
[2016/02/04 14:19:57] <Karkus> Hume2: I think we have way too many levels in the bonus islands tbh
[2016/02/04 14:20:09] <Hume2> Karkus: got what you mean.
[2016/02/04 14:21:11] <Hume2> Anything < 30 levels is just a little thingy :D
